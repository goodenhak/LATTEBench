Provide me a python code for function, given description below.

[FEATURES]

Wrap only the function part with <start> and <end>, and do not add any comments, descriptions, and package importing lines in the code.
Be careful not to retain any intermediate variables in the 'df'!

For Example:
<start>
def feature_generation(df):
    # your code here
    return df
<end>
