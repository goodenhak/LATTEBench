###[]###,
complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
Possible next three steps:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

2026-01-31 00:47:02,466 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [no checking, <0, 0<=X<200, >=200]

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
