You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- DriversLicense: Drivers license, 0=no license, 1=has license (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4444, Std = 0.4975
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- Ethnicity:  (categorical), categories = [White, Latino, Black, Other, Asian]
- BankCustomer: Bank customer, 0=does not have a bank account, 1=has a bank account (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7778, Std = 0.4162
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]

Data Examples:
PriorDefault is 0. ZipCode is 272. Industry is Industrials. DriversLicense is 0. Married is 1. Ethnicity is White. BankCustomer is 1. Debt is 0.54. Employed is 1. CreditScore is 1. Citizen is ByBirth.
Answer: 0
PriorDefault is 0. ZipCode is 0. Industry is Industrials. DriversLicense is 0. Married is 0. Ethnicity is White. BankCustomer is 0. Debt is 1.25. Employed is 0. CreditScore is 0. Citizen is ByBirth.
Answer: 0
PriorDefault is 1. ZipCode is 0. Industry is Materials. DriversLicense is 0. Married is 1. Ethnicity is Black. BankCustomer is 1. Debt is 12.0. Employed is 1. CreditScore is 8. Citizen is ByBirth.
Answer: 1
PriorDefault is 1. ZipCode is 186. Industry is Energy. DriversLicense is 0. Married is 1. Ethnicity is White. BankCustomer is 1. Debt is 1.625. Employed is 1. CreditScore is 10. Citizen is ByBirth.
Answer: 1


Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Accepted solutions so far:

###'<DebtToIncomeRatio><divide><Debt><Income><A measure of financial stability by comparing debt to income levels>
<EmploymentStability><multiply><YearsEmployed><Employed><Indication of job security by considering both years employed and current employment status>
<AgeGroup><bin><Age><Grouping ages into categories to capture trends in credit card applications based on age cohorts>'###

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
Here are evaluated solutions that were rejected:

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:

2026-01-31 01:02:17,468 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

Data Examples:
PriorDefault is 0. ZipCode is 0. Industry is CommunicationServices. Debt is 11.5. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 0. Married is 0. CreditScore is 0.
Answer: 0
PriorDefault is 0. ZipCode is 160. Industry is Financials. Debt is 3.0. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 0. Married is 1. CreditScore is 0.
Answer: 0
PriorDefault is 0. ZipCode is 0. Industry is Energy. Debt is 0.165. Citizen is ByOtherMeans. Employed is 0. Married is 1. CreditScore is 0.
Answer: 1
PriorDefault is 1. ZipCode is 40. Industry is Energy. Debt is 10.0. Citizen is ByOtherMeans. Employed is 0. Married is 0. CreditScore is 0.
Answer: 1

2026-01-31 01:02:27,193 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

Data Examples:
PriorDefault is 0. ZipCode is 0. Industry is CommunicationServices. Debt is 0.17. Citizen is ByOtherMeans. Employed is 0. Married is 1. CreditScore is 0.
Answer: 0
PriorDefault is 0. ZipCode is 120. Industry is Real Estate. Debt is 3.0. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 0. Married is 1. CreditScore is 0.
Answer: 0
PriorDefault is 1. ZipCode is 100. Industry is Materials. Debt is 3.0. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 1. Married is 1. CreditScore is 3.
Answer: 1
PriorDefault is 1. ZipCode is 120. Industry is ConsumerStaples. Debt is 12.5. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 1. Married is 1. CreditScore is 12.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

2026-01-31 01:03:09,357 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

Data Examples:
PriorDefault is 1. ZipCode is 0. Industry is ConsumerDiscretionary. Debt is 3.0. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 0. Married is 1. CreditScore is 0.
Answer: 0
PriorDefault is 0. ZipCode is 272. Industry is Industrials. Debt is 0.54. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 1. Married is 1. CreditScore is 1.
Answer: 0
PriorDefault is 1. ZipCode is 120. Industry is Industrials. Debt is 9.5. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 0. Married is 1. CreditScore is 0.
Answer: 1
PriorDefault is 1. ZipCode is 60. Industry is Energy. Debt is 2.5. Citizen is ByBirth. Employed is 1. Married is 1. CreditScore is 11.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

2026-01-31 01:04:12,087 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

Data Examples:

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Output Format:

2026-01-31 01:05:20,982 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

2026-01-31 01:05:41,579 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- PriorDefault: Prior default, 0=no prior defaults, 1=prior default (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5290, Std = 0.4998
- ZipCode: ZipCode (5 digit number) (numerical), range = [0, 980], Q1 = 73.5, Median = 160.0, Q3 = 272.0, Mean = 177.9976, Std = 155.5543
- Industry: Industry - job sector of current or most recent job (categorical), categories = [ConsumerStaples, Financials, Healthcare, Utilities, InformationTechnology, Industrials, CommunicationServices, Materials, Energy, ConsumerDiscretionary, Real Estate, Education, Research, Transport]
- Debt: Outstanding debt (feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0.0, 28.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 2.52, Q3 = 7.2075, Mean = 4.7518, Std = 5.1544
- Citizen: Citizenship, either ByBirth, ByOtherMeans or Temporary (categorical), categories = [ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary]
- Employed: Employed, 0=not employed, 1=employed (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.4227, Std = 0.4946
- Married: Married, 0=Single/Divorced/etc, 1=Married (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.7754, Std = 0.4178
- CreditScore: Credit score (this feature has been scaled) (numerical), range = [0, 67], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 0.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 2.3019, Std = 5.1602

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
