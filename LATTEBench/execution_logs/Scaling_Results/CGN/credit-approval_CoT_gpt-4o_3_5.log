   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between a person's ethnicity and their job sector. Such interactions can often reveal significant patterns in socio-economic factors and credit card application success rates, possibly due to cultural or industry-specific norms and practices.

2. \<Income_Log\>\<log\>\<Income\>\<Log_transformed_income_for_outlier_mitigation_and_better_scaling\>

   Reasoning: Log transformation of the Income feature can help in managing the skewness caused by extreme values in the distribution. This transformation can make the income feature more normally distributed, which can be more manageable for many machine learning algorithms.

3. \<Debt_CreditScore_Ratio\>\<ratio\>\<Debt\>\<CreditScore\>\<Relationship_between_debt_and_credit_score\>

   Reasoning: The debt-to-credit-score ratio is a critical feature in assessing an individual's capacity to handle more credit. A higher ratio may indicate a higher risk in lending, whereas a lower ratio can signify better financial stability and creditworthiness, directly impacting credit card application success.

   Reasoning: The DebtToIncomeRatio feature has a very high range and standard deviation, indicating it may have a highly skewed distribution. Applying a log transformation helps in reducing skewness and making relationships more linear, which can be beneficial for many models.

2. <EmployedYearsRatio><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><Ratio_of_years_employed_to_age_to_assess_experience_relative_to_age>
   
   Reasoning: This feature captures the experience level of an individual relative to their age. Younger individuals with more years employed might be seen as highly experienced for their age, potentially affecting credit approval decisions.

3. <IndustryBankCustomerCross><cross><Industry><BankCustomer><Interaction_between_industry_and_bank_customer_status_to_identify_patterns>
   
   Reasoning: Understanding the cross-effect between the industry of employment and bank customer status could help identify which industries have more bank customers and how that relates to credit card application success. This may reveal sector-specific credit behaviors and bank relationships.

2026-01-30 13:12:07,627 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to improve predictions in the credit card application context:

1. <DebtToIncomeLog><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Log_transformation_of_DebtToIncomeRatio_for_better_distribution_handling>
   - Reasoning: The DebtToIncomeRatio feature has a very high range and standard deviation, which suggests it might have extreme skewness. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help in handling the distribution and bringing it closer to a normal distribution. This often improves the performance of models sensitive to the range of input data by reducing skewness and outliers' effect.

2. <AgeEmployedCross><cross><Age><Employed><Interaction_between_Age_and_Employed_status_to_capture_effect_of_age_on_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: This feature is designed to interpret if older applicants have more stability being employed compared to younger ones. Older individuals with employment might indicate stronger responsible financial behavior. The cross operator is used here to capture this possible interaction more explicitly between these two variables.

3. <IndustryLabel><label_encode><Industry><Numeric_representation_of_industry_category>
   - Reasoning: The Industry feature is categorical, and encoding it using label encoding will convert each unique industry category into a numerical value. Numerical representations of categorical data can be critical for many machine learning algorithms, especially those that calculate distances or create splits based on numerical value, thus making it understandable for the model while maintaining the categorical nature.

   - Reasoning: Normalizing AgeYearsEmployedInteraction to the same scale helps the model interpret this feature relative to others, capturing stability in employment over a range which could be crucial for creditworthiness.

2. <IncomeZScore><zscore><Income><Standardized_income_for_outlier_detection_and_scalability>
   - Reasoning: Applying z-score standardization to Income aids in detecting outliers and ensuring that high variance in income doesn't skew model predictions, making the model learn more generalized patterns.

3. <PriorDefaultBankCustomerCross><cross><PriorDefault><BankCustomer><Interplay_between_prior_default_and_bank_customer_status_for_credit_risk_analysis>
   - Reasoning: By crossing PriorDefault and BankCustomer, we capture complex interactions that could indicate a nuanced credit risk profile. Having a bank account while having prior defaults may influence credit status differently than having defaults without an account.

2026-01-30 13:12:24,363 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features, considering the goal of improving the downstream model's performance in predicting credit card application success:

1. Interaction between income and bank customer status: Although Income is scaled, the relationship between having a bank account and income might reveal more about an individual's financial stability. By interacting these features, we can capture this potential effect:
   
   
   <IncomeBankCustomerInteraction><multiply><Income><BankCustomer><Interaction_of_income_and_bank_customer_status_to_assess_financial_stability>
   

2. Age and years employed impact: While AgeYearsEmployedInteraction captures interaction, additional income effects on mean deviation in employment can reveal more about risk related to age or employment. Given that experience affects income, a mean deviation will determine its significance:

   
   <EmploymentIncomeDeviation><subtract><AgeYearsEmployedInteraction><YearsEmployed><Deviation_between_aged_interaction_and_experience>
   

3. Interaction of prior default with zip code: Given that regional economic conditions (reflected by zip code) may affect credit risk, combining zipcode and prior default status might help identify risky applicants who had defaults before, in specific regions:
   
   
   <PriorDefaultZipcodeInteraction><multiply><PriorDefault><ZipCode><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_zipcode_to_identify_risk_in_specific_areas>

2026-01-30 13:12:28,595 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible feature engineering steps, each generating a new feature that could potentially enhance the model's ability to predict successful credit card applications:

1. To capture the joint influence of age, work experience, and citizenship status on credit card application success, we create a cross feature:
   - <AgeYearsEmployedCitizenCross><cross><AgeYearsEmployedInteraction><Citizen><interaction_of_age_employment_and_citizenship_to_assess_stability>

2. Considering the relationship between income and bank customer status could be significant, let's create a ratio:
   - <IncomeBankCustomerRatio><ratio><Income><BankCustomer><ratio_of_income_to_bank_customer_status_for_financial_analysis>

3. The industry might have a differing impact on credit applications; generate mean statistics of credit approvals by industry:
   - <IndustryApprovalRate><groupbythenmean><Industry><answer><average_credit_approval_rate_by_industry>

These steps aim to capture complex patterns and interactions that might be insightful in predicting credit card application success.

2026-01-30 13:12:37,293 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential features that could be generated to potentially improve the model's predictions for credit card application success:

1. \<YearsEmployedBucket\><bin>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Creating_buckets_for_years_employed_into_categories_to_capture_experience_levels\>

   Reasoning: By creating bins for the YearsEmployed feature, we can categorize applicants into experience levels. This could help in recognizing patterns where applicants with certain experience levels are more likely to succeed in their credit card applications.

2. \<IncomeLogTransformed\><log>\<Income\>\<Log_transformation_of_income_to_reduce_skewness_and_handle_large_income_values\>

   Reasoning: Income data often has a wide range, with potential outliers. Applying a log transformation can help in normalizing the data, making it easier for the model to learn patterns in the presence of skewed income data.

3. \<Industry_Citizen_Cross\><cross>\<Industry\>\<Citizen\>\<Combining_industry_and_citizenship_status_to_explore_the_interaction_between_job_sector_and_national_status\>

   Reasoning: By crossing the Industry and Citizen features, we can explore whether certain industries and citizenship statuses together have an impact on the likelihood of a successful credit card application. This interaction might uncover patterns that are not visible when considering each feature separately.

   Reasoning: By scaling the 'Income' feature using min-max normalization, we reduce its wide range, making it easier for the model to converge during training and potentially emphasizing more on low or mid-range incomes.

2. <PriorDefaultAgeEmployedInteraction><multiply><PriorDefault><AgeYearsEmployedInteraction><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_age_years_employed_for_risk_assessment>

   Reasoning: Creating an interaction between 'PriorDefault' and 'AgeYearsEmployedInteraction' can highlight individuals who have prior defaults and also a substantial history of employment experience, aiding in better risk assessment for credit card approval.

3. <IndustryCitizenCross><cross><Industry><Citizen><Combined_feature_of_industry_and_citizenship_for_better_categorization>

   Reasoning: Crossing 'Industry' and 'Citizen' can offer insights into which industry sectors interact uniquely with citizenship statuses, potentially pointing to the influence of these two factors on credit card approval rates.

    - Reasoning: Interaction between having a prior default and AgeYearsEmployedInteraction can provide insight into whether previous defaults influence the stability or experience a person gains with age and employment history. This feature could highlight cases where even individuals with prior defaults might eventually have a stable employment history over time.

2. <IncomeLog><log><Income><Log_transformation_of_income_for_skewness_reduction>
    - Reasoning: Income data often tend to be right-skewed. Applying a log transformation can help in normalizing the distribution, which aids in reducing the impact of extreme values and might improve model performance and stability.

3. <IndustryZipCross><cross><IndustryLabel><ZipCode><Combined_effect_of_industry_and_geographical_code_for_success_rate_analysis>
    - Reasoning: The geographical and industry context can greatly influence credit card approval success rates due to regional economic conditions and industry-specific risks. By creating a cross feature, it's possible to capture nuances that are specific to particular industry-zip code combinations that could influence credit decisions.

   - Reasoning: The ratio of income to years employed can be indicative of an individual's earning power and financial stability. A higher ratio can imply better financial health, which may influence credit card approval.

3. <CitizenIndustryCross><cross><Citizen><Industry><interaction_between_citizenship_and_industry_to_capture_joint_effects_on_credit_approval>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between citizenship status and industry may reveal important patterns that affect credit card application outcomes. Some industries may favor or restrict non-citizens, and capturing this joint effect may help improve the model's classification accuracy.

### Explanation:

1. ZipCode_Income_Interaction: Creating an interaction term between ZipCode and Income could help in capturing the geographic economic variation impact on credit card success. It combines regional and income information to help understand areas with high income better and potentially segments applicants into different groups based on their combined incomes and locations.

2. YearsEmployed_zscore: By calculating the Z-score of YearsEmployed, this feature standardizes the employment duration data. This is useful in identifying outliers or anomalies in the work history that might contribute significantly to understanding the applicant's job stability, which is an important aspect in the context of credit applications.

3. BankCustomer_Citizen_cross: This cross feature combines BankCustomer and Citizen statuses. It may reveal insights into how having a bank account and different kinds of citizenship status affect the likelihood of credit approval. This interaction can highlight specific segments of the population that either benefit from or are disadvantaged by their banking status and citizenship combination.

   The Income feature has a wide range and a high standard deviation, suggesting it may be skewed. Applying a log transformation can help reduce the impact of outliers and stabilize variance, potentially aiding the model in better understanding the relationships involving Income.

2. \<Experience_Wealth_Index\>multiply\<AgeYearsEmployedInteraction\>\<Income_ZipCode_ratio\>\<Combine_experience_and_wealth_density_to_estimate_potential_creditworthiness\>

   This new feature captures the interaction between a person's experience (measured by AgeYearsEmployedInteraction) and their economic environment (measured by Income_ZipCode_ratio). This composite metric may provide a deeper insight into a person's creditworthiness by considering both personal and regional economic factors.

3. \<Industry_Citizen_Label\>label_encode\<Industry_Citizen_cross\>\<Convert_Industry_Citizen_interaction_to_numerical_values_to_enable_interaction_with_other_features\>

   By label encoding the Industry_Citizen_cross, we convert this complex categorical interaction into a numerical value that can interact with other numerical features. This transformation may help the model capture the effect of industry and citizenship combinations on credit card application success more effectively.

   Reasoning: Standardizing YearsEmployed can help the model capture the relative stability in employment for applicants. Applicants with significantly lower or higher years of employment than average might exhibit different patterns in terms of credit card application success.

2. <Interaction_Citizen_Income_ratio><cross><Citizen><Income_ZipCode_ratio><Capture_the_influence_of_citizenship_and_income_density_combination_on_credit_card_success>

   Reasoning: By examining the interaction between Citizen status and Income_ZipCode_ratio, we can gain insights into how different citizenship statuses affect the relationship between income and location. This might reveal unique characteristics of applicants that differentiate successful applications.

3. <AgeYearsEmployed_log><log><AgeYearsEmployedInteraction><Apply_log_transformation_to_captures_experience_and_stability>

   Reasoning: Taking the logarithm of AgeYearsEmployedInteraction can help compress the range of this feature, which is highly skewed. This could improve the model’s ability to capture the underlying non-linear relationships between age, employment experience, and credit card application success.

2026-01-30 13:13:52,492 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <PriorDefault_IncomeInteraction>multiply<PriorDefault><Income><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_income_to_assess_if_higher_income_with_prior_defaults_impact_success>
   
   Reasoning: This interaction can help in understanding if individuals with prior defaults but higher income levels are considered more eligible for credit card approvals.

2. <Normalized_PriorDefaultAgeYearsEmployed_product>minmax<PriorDefaultAgeYearsEmployed_product><Normalized_product_feature_to_reduce_skewness_and_improve_model_performance>
   
   Reasoning: Normalizing the feature using min-max scaling can help in reducing the skewness, especially since the feature has a large range. This might improve model performance by putting all features in the same range, making it easier for the model to learn.

3. <CitizenIncomeRatio_Income_ZipCode_combined>multiply<Interaction_Citizen_Income_ratio><Income_ZipCode_ratio><Combining_income_density_and_citizenship_income_interaction_to_boost_signal_strength_related_to_application_success>
   
   Reasoning: By combining these two ratios, it may provide a more complex feature capturing the combined effect of income distribution and citizenship status, potentially leading to better discrimination in predicting credit card application success.

2. \<Income_ZipCode_Interaction\>multiply\<Income\>\ZipCode\Create_interaction_of_income_and_zipcode_to_capture_combined_effect_on_wealth_density  
   *Reasoning: By creating an interaction term between Income and ZipCode, we are potentially capturing the effect of income in a particular region. This could be especially relevant for financial decisions such as credit card applications, where local economic conditions may influence outcomes.*

3. \<Industry_Encoded\>label_encode\<Industry\>Numeric_representation_of_Industry_to_enable_interaction_with_numerical_features

   - Reasoning: Combining 'PriorDefault' with 'Income' gives insight into how previous defaults affect creditworthiness relative to income level.

2. \<IndustryCreditScoreEffect\>cross\<Industry\>\<PriorDefaultCreditScoreInteraction\>\<Capture_industry_specific_effect_on_credit_scoring\>
   - Reasoning: Exploring the interaction between industry type and prior default credit score interaction can reveal industry-specific credit behavior patterns affecting application success.

3. \<CitizenIncomeStability\>divide\<Income\>\<AgeYearsEmployedInteraction\>\<Assess_income_relative_to_experience_stability_and_citizenship\>  
   - Reasoning: Providing insight into how income relates to applicant stability (experience by age), which may vary across citizenship status, affecting credit approval likelihood.

These features aim to capture nuanced interactions and dependencies that are not linear, thus potentially improving model performance on predicting credit card application success.

   Reasoning: Applying min-max scaling to the PriorDefaultAgeYearsEmployed_product can help normalize the range of this feature, improving model stability and ensuring it doesn't dominate due to its larger scale as compared to other features.

2. \<CitizenLabel\>label_encode\<Citizen\>\<Convert_Citizen_status_to_numerical_format_for_easier_handling_by_models\>

   Reasoning: Encoding the Citizen categorical feature into a numerical format allows easier integration with numerical models and eliminates bias based on string representations.

3. \<Income_exp\>exp\<Income\>\<Apply_exponential_transformation_to_handles_large_variations_in_income_and_emphasize_high_values\>

   Reasoning: Applying an exponential transformation to Income helps emphasize larger incomes which could be more predictive of credit application success, as people with higher income might more likely be approved.

2026-01-30 13:14:15,416 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential steps for generating new features to improve the downstream model's performance in predicting credit card application success:

1. \<Income_Binned>\<bin>\<Income>\<Creating_income_bins_for_better_group_analysis\>
   - Reasoning: Binning the income feature can help capture non-linear relationships by grouping applicants into brackets that might reveal patterns related to credit card application success. This can especially be useful when dealing with skewed data.

2. \<AgeYearsEmployed_normalized>\<zscore>\<AgeYearsEmployedInteraction>\<Normalize_experience_and_stability_for_better_interpretation_of_this_feature\>
   - Reasoning: Z-score normalization of the AgeYearsEmployedInteraction could help in standardizing the feature, which often aids models in learning from features with large disparities in their magnitude.

3. \<Industry_Citizen_IndustryCrossLabelEncoded>\<label_encode>\<Industry_Citizen_cross>\<Cross_encoded_label_to_capture_interaction\>
   - Reasoning: Applying label encoding to the cross of Industry and Citizen categories could provide a numerical representation that distinctly captures the interaction effects of these categorical variables for the model. This might help identify unique patterning in data based on this combination.

These steps leverage statistical transformations, binning, and encoding to extract and encode meaningful information from the data, potentially improving the predictive power of the model.

3. \<Income_Industry_interaction\>cross\<Income\>\<IndustryLabel\>\<Interaction_between_income_and_industry_to_capture_sectoral_wealth_effect\>

Reasoning:

1. PriorDefault_AgeYearsEmployedInteraction_ratio: Calculating the ratio between the PriorDefaultAgeYearsEmployed_product and AgeYearsEmployedInteraction can provide insights into how the experience and stability affect credit card applications when adjusted for prior defaults. This normalized feature might help in understanding whether higher normalized values correlate with application success or not.

2. CitizenEncoded: By label encoding the Citizen categorical feature, we convert it into a numerical format that can be used directly as input for machine learning models. This transformation may help the model understand the effect of citizenship status on the success of credit card applications.

3. Income_Industry_interaction: Creating a new feature that captures the interaction between Income and IndustryLabel through cross operation is meaningful because it considers how the combination of income with the specific industry sector can impact credit card application outcomes. This can be particularly useful to capture industry-specific economic dynamics related to financial decisions.

2026-01-30 13:14:44,288 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating features to enhance the prediction of credit card application success:

1. \<PriorDefault_Income_log_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<PriorDefault\> \<log\> \<Income\> \<Assess_the_non-linear_interaction_between_prior_default_and_income_level_for_credit_worthiness\>  
   * Reasoning: By computing the log of income, we can handle the skewness in income distribution, and multiplying it with PriorDefault captures non-linear impacts that prior credit behavior and income levels might jointly have on application outcomes.

2. \<Citizenship_Industry_Experience_cross\> \<cross\> \<Industry\> \<cross\> \<concat\> \<Citizen\> \<AgeYearsEmployedInteraction\> \<Capture_combined_effect_of_citizenship_industry_and_work_experience_on_credit_card_application\>  
   * Reasoning: Combining citizenship status with work sector and experience level can highlight specific demographic groups that may have different success rates due to socio-economic and cultural profiles.

3. \<Mean_Income_ZipCode\> \<groupbythenmean\> \<ZipCode\> \<Income\> \<Calculate_average_income_based_on_zip_code_for_local_wealth_assessment\>  
   * Reasoning: By calculating the mean income in a zip code, we can estimate the area's typical economic status, which might reveal local socioeconomic factors influencing credit card application success.

Explanation:
1. \PriorDefault_AgeNormalInteraction\: Understanding how a prior default interacts with the somewhat normalized log-scaled age and years employed feature can capture nuanced insights into how age and employment experience against a default history impact credit card application success.

2. \Income_IndustryEffect\: Combining income with industry type via a cross operation will capture how different industries may have varying impacts on income and thus offer insights into credit card success likelihood by industry group.

3. \ZipCode_CitizenConcentration\: Using a groupby operation to compute average income for each ZipCode can offer insights into which regions have higher wealth concentrations. This information combined with citizenship status could illuminate regional credit success patterns based on demographic distributions.

2026-01-30 13:15:21,106 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible next steps with feature engineering operations to potentially enhance the downstream task of predicting credit card application success:

1. \<PriorDefault_IndustryLabel_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<PriorDefault\> \<IndustryLabel\> \<Interaction_between_prior_default_and_industry_for_credit_evaluation\>
   - Reasoning: This feature blends the Prior Default status with the Industry Label, which might reveal how having a prior default within particular industries affects credit card application success. 

2. \<AgeYearsEmployedExperience_Citizen_cross\> \<cross\> \<divide\> \<AgeYearsEmployedInteraction\> \<AgeYearsEmployed_log\> \<Citizen\> \<Combine_experience_and_citizenship_to_predict_success\>
   - Reasoning: By incorporating citizenship status with a measure of experience persistence, we can capture how the combination of stability and citizenship status affects application outcomes.

3. \<Income_Category\> \<bin\> \<Income\> \<Categorize_income_to_study_effect_on_success\>
   - Reasoning: Categorizing income can reveal non-linear effects on credit card success rates. This transformation can help detect thresholds or segments where income impacts credit card approval most significantly. 

These steps involve generating interaction terms and transforming existing numerical features to capture more complex relationships potentially impacting the outcome variable.

2. <IndustryLabel_Income_ratio><divide><IndustryLabel><Income><Assess_the_importance_of_industry_on_income_proportion_with_respect_to_credit_card_application>
   - Reasoning: The ratio between industry label and income might indicate how industry affects income levels, which could be a determinant of credit card application success.

3. <CitizenIncomeLabel_Interaction><cross><Interaction_Citizen_Income_ratio><IndustryLabel><Understand_the_influence_of_citizenship_and_income_combined_with_industry_on_application_success>
   - Reasoning: By crossing citizen and income interaction with industry label, we can explore the impact of these combined factors on the probability of successfully applying for a credit card.

2026-01-30 13:15:42,364 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the predictive power of the model for credit card application success. The reasoning behind these steps is detailed below each one.

1. Create a feature that captures the exponential growth of the income-to-zip code ratio. This may highlight the non-linear effects of income distribution across areas on creditworthiness.

   plaintext
   <IncomeZipCodeExp><exp><Income_ZipCode_ratio><Capture_exponential_growth_effects_of_income_density_on_credit_card_success>
   

2. Introduce an interaction feature between age and income to examine how age and earning capacity together influence creditworthiness. For this, the interaction may expose potential non-linear relationships between age, income, and successful credit card applications.

   plaintext
   <AgeIncomeInteraction><multiply><AgeYearsEmployedInteraction><Income><Combine_age_and_income_to_analyze_their_joint_effect_on_credit_card_success>
   

3. Compute the cosine of the zip code, treating it as a proxy for geographical location, to potentially capture cyclical geographical effects on successful credit card applications.

   plaintext
   <ZipCodeCosine><cosine><ZipCode><Capture_geographical_cycle_effects_on_credit_card_application_success>
    

Reasoning:

1. Exponential Growth of Income-to-Zip Code Ratio: This feature will apply an exponential transformation to the income-to-zip code ratio, which might help in identifying areas with exponentially growing or diminishing wealth, potentially influencing credit card application success.

2. Age and Income Interaction: The interaction between age and income could reveal insightful patterns related to an individual's financial maturity and creditworthiness. Younger individuals with higher income might have different credit profiles compared to older individuals with similar income.

3. Zip Code Cosine: By applying a cosine transformation, the aim is to capture cyclical patterns based on geographical area that may not be immediately apparent with the raw zip code values alone. This could correlate with economic factors or demographic cycles at play in different regions.

2026-01-30 13:15:47,001 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature generation:

1. \<AvgIncomeByZipCode\><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Income>\<Calculate_average_income_per_zipcode_to_identify_wealth_distribution_patterns\>  
   Reasoning: This feature calculates the average income for each ZipCode to capture wealth distribution patterns across different areas. This can provide insights into regional economic status impacting credit card application success.

2. \<PriorDefault_Industry_Label_Interaction\><cross><PriorDefault><IndustryLabel>\<Capture_how_prior_default_and_industry_combination_affects_success_prediction\>  
   Reasoning: By creating an interaction between PriorDefault and IndustryLabel, we can capture the combined effect of a past default and the industry on credit card application success, offering a nuanced view of sectors where prior defaults might be more forgiven.

3. \<Income_ZipCode_ratio_log\><log><Income_ZipCode_ratio>\<Apply_log_transformation_to_smooth_skewness_in_income_zipcode_ratio\>  
   Reasoning: Logging the Income_ZipCode_ratio feature will help in normalizing the data distribution, particularly addressing skewness, and can lead to better model performance by reducing the impact of outliers.

2026-01-30 13:15:56,775 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the model's performance, feature engineering can further enhance the dataset by creating new, informative features or transforming existing ones:

1. Create Interaction Features:
   - Combining numerical features with transformations and interactions can reveal non-linear relationships between variables, which may be crucial for prediction.

   
   <PriorDefaultAgeYearsEmployed_log_sq><square><PriorDefaultAgeYearsEmployed_log><Square_of_log_transformed_experience_to_introduce_nonlinear_stability_effect>
   

2. Categorical Encoding:
   - Encoding categorical features into numerical values allows for better mathematical manipulation and analysis in models that require numerical inputs. This can help the model in capturing group differences more effectively.

   
   <IndustryLabel_encoded><label_encode><Industry><Encode_Industry_as_numerical_value_for_better_grouping>
   

3. Income and ZipCode Analysis through Grouping:
   - Understanding the average income by ZipCode can illuminate wealth density, potentially highlighting areas with historically better credit profiles.

   
   <AvgIncome_per_ZipCode><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Income><Average_Income_by_ZipCode_as_proxy_for_area-based_wealth_density>
   

These steps can uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data, potentially resulting in a better-performing predictive model.
