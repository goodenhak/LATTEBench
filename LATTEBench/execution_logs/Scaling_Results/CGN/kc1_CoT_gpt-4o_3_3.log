Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

Features:
- uniq_Op: numeric % unique operators (numerical), range = [0.0, 30.0], Q1 = 3.0, Median = 6.0, Q3 = 11.0, Mean = 7.6721, Std = 5.7107
- lOCode: numeric % Halstead's line count (numerical), range = [0, 251], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 5.0, Q3 = 17.0, Mean = 14.5186, Std = 23.9415
- total_Opnd: numeric % total operands (numerical), range = [0.0, 428.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 6.0, Q3 = 22.0, Mean = 18.8658, Std = 32.3514

1. \<avg_operands_per_op\><divide>\<total_Opnd\>\<uniq_Op\><average_operands_per_unique_operator>
   - Explanation: Calculating the average operands per unique operator can give an insight into the complexity and richness of the code's logic. A high ratio might indicate sections of code that are complex and potential defect hotspots.

2. \<diff_lOCode_totalOpnd\><subtract>\<lOCode\>\<total_Opnd\><lines_of_code_minus_total_operands>
   - Explanation: The difference between the line count and total operands can help understand if lines of code are densely packed with operations, which might suggest complexity and higher risk of defects.

3. \<difficulty_zscore\><zscore>\<d\><zscore_of_difficulty>
   - Explanation: Calculating the z-score of the difficulty metric can standardize this feature, highlighting modules that are unusually difficult compared to the average. Modules with high z-scores might be more prone to defects, as they represent outliers in terms of code complexity.

   Reasoning: Multiplying the number of unique operators by the total operands could identify complex interactions in the code that may indicate a higher likelihood of defects. It accounts for instances where both unique operators and a high number of operands contribute jointly to defect-prone areas.

2. <normalized_difficulty><minmax><d><normalized_difficulty_between_0_and_1>
   
   Reasoning: Normalizing the difficulty feature will make it more comparable across different modules by scaling it between 0 and 1. This could help in comparing difficulty levels across different code segments more effectively.

3. <complexity_ratio><divide><lOCode><total_Opnd><ratio_of_Halstead_line_count_to_total_operands>
   
   Reasoning: This ratio provides insight into how balanced or unbalanced the software module is between lines of code and operands. This appropriateness or imbalance might be indicative of defect potential – a high ratio could indicate dense code that is harder to maintain.

2026-01-30 13:35:37,864 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features that may improve the performance of the software defect prediction model:

1. <normalized_uniq_Op><zscore><uniq_Op><zscore_of_uniq_Op_to_standardize_and_identify_outliers>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing the uniq_Op feature by transforming it to its z-score can help in normalizing the data, which is often beneficial for many machine learning algorithms. It also helps in identifying outliers that might indicate unusual cases potentially associated with defects.

2. <total_Opnd_to_lOCode_ratio><ratio><total_Opnd><lOCode><ratio_of_total_operands_to_lines_of_code>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the density of operands relative to the lines of code. A higher ratio might suggest more complex, possibly defect-prone code, while a lower ratio might indicate simpler, less error-prone code.

3. <difficulty_and_operator_product><multiply><d><uniq_Op><interaction_between_difficulty_and_unique_operators>
   - Reasoning: By creating a feature representing the product of the d (difficulty) and uniq_Op (unique operators), we capture the interaction between these two aspects of complexity that could be influential in predicting software defects. This interaction can reveal nuanced patterns not evident when considering these metrics separately.

Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

Features:
- uniq_Op: numeric % unique operators (numerical), range = [0.0, 30.0], Q1 = 3.0, Median = 6.0, Q3 = 11.0, Mean = 7.6721, Std = 5.7107
- lOCode: numeric % Halstead's line count (numerical), range = [0, 251], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 5.0, Q3 = 17.0, Mean = 14.5186, Std = 23.9415
- total_Opnd: numeric % total operands (numerical), range = [0.0, 428.0], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 6.0, Q3 = 22.0, Mean = 18.8658, Std = 32.3514
- d: numeric % Halstead 'difficulty' (numerical), range = [0.0, 53.75], Q1 = 1.5, Median = 3.6, Q3 = 9.4, Mean = 6.8061, Std = 7.7953

2026-01-30 13:35:56,316 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve predictions for the KC1 software defect prediction task:

1. \<uniq_Op_normalized\> \<minmax\> \<uniq_Op\> \<Normalize uniq_Op to range [0,1]\>
   
   Reasoning: By normalizing the feature uniq_Op, we can minimize the effect of scaling differences among features when used in machine learning models, potentially improving model performance.

2. \<code_complexity\> \<multiply\> \<lOCode\> \<d\> \<Quantify code complexity by combining line count and difficulty\>

   Reasoning: Combining the Halstead's line count lOCode with 'difficulty' d may provide a more comprehensive metric for code complexity, as complex code tends to be both lengthy and difficult, potentially improving defect prediction.

3. \<log_total_Opnd\> \<log\> \<total_Opnd\> \<Log-transform total_Opnd to reduce skewness in distribution\>

   Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to total_Opnd can help stabilize variance and reduce skewness, making the feature more linearly related to the target, which may aid downstream models in making better predictions.

2026-01-30 13:36:19,229 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operators:

1. <sqrt_uniq_Op><sqrt><uniq_Op><Square_root_of_unique_operators>
   - Reasoning: Applying the square root transformation can help stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed. This might capture better relationships if the effect of unique operators on defects is non-linear.

2. <interaction_Op_Opnd><multiply><uniq_Op><total_Opnd><Interaction_between_unique_operators_and_total_operands>
   - Reasoning: Creating an interaction term between unique operators and total operands can capture any combined effect these features might have on the likelihood of defects, which could be missed when these features are considered independently.

3. <scaled_lOCode_logd><multiply><normalized_lOCode><log_d><Interaction_between_scaled_line_count_and_log_difficulty>
   - Reasoning: By creating an interaction between these two normalized metrics, we can explore if specific combinations of code complexity (logged difficulty) and code length (normalized line count) contribute to defect likelihoods, potentially surfacing nuanced predictive patterns.

2026-01-30 13:36:29,582 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's develop three potential new features for the software defect prediction task using the provided operators, aiming to improve the model's performance.

1. \<interaction_sqrt_Op_total_Opnd\>\<multiply\>\<sqrt_uniq_Op\>\<total_Opnd\>\<Interaction_between_square_root_of_unique_operators_and_total_operands\>  
   - Reasoning: Feature interactions can capture complex patterns that individual features might miss. Multiplying sqrt_uniq_Op with total_Opnd can highlight more sophisticated influence patterns of operators and operands on predicting software defects.

2. \<log_interaction_Op_Opnd\>\<log\>\<interaction_Op_Opnd\>\<Log_transformed_interaction_between_unique_operators_and_total_operands\>  
   - Reasoning: Applying a log transformation can help normalize skewed data by reducing the impact of extreme values. This transformation might reveal underlying trends more suitable for predictive models, especially when dealing with heavily skewed data like interaction_Op_Opnd.

3. \<bin_scaled_lOCode_logd\>\<bin\>\<scaled_lOCode_logd\>\<Binned_scaled_interaction_between_line_count_and_log_difficulty\>  
   - Reasoning: Binning continuous features can mitigate the noise by reducing the variability within intervals, potentially offering more robust indications of the relationship between code metrics and defects. This step can convert continuous measures into ordered categories, helpful for capturing non-linear relationships pertinent to defect prediction.

2026-01-30 13:36:34,456 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<log_uniq_Op\><log>\<uniq_Op\><Log_transformed_unique_operators>  
   Reasoning: Applying the log transformation can help in reducing the skewness of the 'uniq_Op' feature, dealing with potential non-linearity and improving the performance of models sensitive to feature distribution, such as linear models.

2. \<interaction_d_total_Opnd\><multiply>\<d\>\<total_Opnd\><Interaction_between_difficulty_and_total_operands>  
   Reasoning: This interaction term will capture the compounded effect of complexity measured by 'd' and the size-related feature 'total_Opnd', which might be influential in predicting defects more accurately by highlighting complex and large modules.

3. \<exp_scaled_lOCode_logd\><exp>\<scaled_lOCode_logd\><Exponentiated_interaction_of_scaled_line_count_and_log_difficulty>  
   Reasoning: Exponentiating 'scaled_lOCode_logd' could emphasize larger interaction values while diminishing the differences between smaller ones. This might prove beneficial in capturing nonlinear relationships not evident in its current form.

2026-01-30 13:36:41,343 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <reciprocal_uniq_Op><reciprocal><uniq_Op><Reciprocal_of_unique_operators>
   
   Reasoning: The reciprocal transformation can help linearize relationships and deal with skewness in the distribution of uniq_Op. This feature may capture a different aspect of the relationship between unique operators and defects, which can be useful for models sensitive to such nuances.

2. <sin_lOCode><sine><lOCode><Sine_transform_of_Halstead_line_count>
   
   Reasoning: Applying a non-linear transformation like sine to lOCode can capture periodic relationships or nonlinearities that might exist between line count values and defect occurrence. This is particularly useful if there are cyclic patterns in the data that are not linear.

3. <uniq_Op_total_Opnd_interaction_log><log><interaction_Op_Opnd><Log_transform_of_unique_operators_and_total_operands_interaction>
   
   Reasoning: The interaction between uniq_Op and total_Opnd reflects combined effects that could be crucial in determining defects. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help reduce skewness and may amplify smaller changes in this interaction term, which may be indicative of defect patterns.

   Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to the interaction between unique operators and total operands can help normalize the distribution if it is skewed. Log transformations are effective in managing skewness and variance, which can improve model performance.

2. \<unique_operands_percentage\>ratio\<total_Opnd\>\<uniq_Op\>\<percentage_of_unique_operands_relative_to_unique_operators\>

   Reasoning: Calculating the percentage of operands relative to unique operators gives insight into the complexity and usage of programming constructs within the software module. It could be a useful feature to understand the balance or imbalance between operators and operands, which might correlate with software defects.

3. \<zscore_sqrt_uniq_Op\>zscore\<sqrt_uniq_Op\>\<z_score_normalized_square_root_of_unique_operators\>

   Reasoning: Standardizing the square root of unique operators using z-score normalization could be valuable for enhancing the model's ability to effectively compare and analyze unique operators across different modules, as it removes the impact of differing scales and centers.

Step 1: Log transforming the interaction between difficulty and total operands can help manage skewness and enhance the visibility of differences in smaller values, which might boost the model's ability to detect subtle defect patterns.

Step 2: Applying a cosine transformation to the ratio of unique operators to total operands can help capture periodicity or cyclical patterns that might be inherent in the code structure, shedding light on complex relationships that could correlate with defect presence.

Step 3: Engineering an interaction feature between the log transformed difficulty and scaled line count log difficulty emphasizes co-relationships between difficulty and complexity measures, potentially highlighting modules where defect likelihood increases due to these factors acting together.

   Reasoning: Log transformation can help normalize the distribution of interaction_Op_Opnd, potentially improving model performance by reducing skewness and handling outliers more effectively.

2. <zscore_total_Opnd><zscore><total_Opnd><Zscore_transformed_total_operands>

   Reasoning: Applying z-score normalization can standardize total_Opnd, making it easier for the model to learn by centering the data around 0 and scaling based on standard deviation, which can help in improving the learning of differences and relationships between features.

3. <exp_log_d><exp><log_d><Exponentiated_log_transformed_Halstead_difficulty>

   Reasoning: Exponentiating log_d can help capture nonlinear relationships that may exist within the Halstead difficulty scores, possibly unveiling patterns and interactions that linear models might miss, thus enhancing feature representation for the model.

   *Reasoning:* The interaction between 'difficulty' and 'total operands' is a significant feature, and applying a square root transformation can help normalize its distribution and potentially make it more predictive for models that are sensitive to feature scaling.

2. \<log_interaction_Op_Opnd\>log\<interaction_Op_Opnd\>\<Log_transformed_interaction_of_unique_operators_and_total_operands\>  
   *Reasoning:* The interaction between 'unique operators' and 'total operands' is likely to be skewed. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help stabilize variance, improve normality, and enhance model interpretability.

3. \<normalized_interaction_Op_Opnd\>minmax\<interaction_Op_Opnd\>\<Normalized_interaction_between_unique_operators_and_total_operands\>  
   *Reasoning:* Normalizing the 'interaction between unique operators and total operands' feature can aid algorithms that are sensitive to input scales, like neural networks, leading to better convergence and improved performance on predictive tasks.

Explanation:

1. interaction_d_normalized_lOCode: By multiplying d (difficulty) with normalized_lOCode (normalized line count), we generate a feature that captures the combined effects of code complexity and the proportion of code lines, which may influence defect occurrence. This captures interactions between module complexity and size.

2. log_interaction_d_total_Opnd: By log-transforming interaction_d_total_Opnd, we address potential skewness in the data, making it more normally distributed. This transformation could enhance the performance of models that assume normality, helping improve predictions related to defect occurrence.

3. ratio_uniq_Op_normalized_lOCode: Taking the ratio of uniq_Op (unique operators) to normalized_lOCode assesses the density of unique operators per normalized line of code. High density could correlate with module complexity, impacting defect predictions due to potentially intricate code logic or operations.

   Reasoning: By multiplying sqrt_uniq_Op and log_d, this new feature may capture interactions between unique operators and code difficulty, potentially revealing complex relationships between code complexity and quality.

2. <ratio_lOCode_sqrt_uniq_Op><ratio><lOCode><sqrt_uniq_Op><Ratio_of_line_count_to_sqrt_of_unique_operators_for_balancing_code_quantity_and_quality_indicators>

   Reasoning: The ratio between lOCode and sqrt_uniq_Op could highlight whether a high line count relative to the number of unique operators is associated with defect presence, possibly indicating inefficiencies or code bloat.

3. <exp_normalized_lOCode><exp><normalized_lOCode><Exponentiated_normalized_line_count_to_emphasize_high_effects_of_code_volume>

   Reasoning: Applying an exponential transformation on normalized_lOCode can accentuate the impact of code volume in a non-linear manner, which might be useful in distinguishing between modules with significantly different amounts of code.

2026-01-30 13:38:05,790 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps using the given operators, designed to potentially improve the model's predictive performance for the software defect prediction task:

1. \<difficulty_line_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<d\>\<lOCode\>\<Ratio_of_Halstead_difficulty_to_line_count\>  
   - Reasoning: By creating a ratio between Halstead difficulty and line count, we aim to identify modules where the complexity relative to the size could be insightful. Higher complexity per line might indicate potential for defects.

2. \<log_interaction_d_total_Opnd\>\<log\>\<interaction_d_total_Opnd\>\<Log_transformed_interaction_between_difficulty_and_total_operands\>  
   - Reasoning: The interaction between difficulty and total operands is likely to be important, and applying a log transformation can help stabilize variance and potentially reveal multiplicative relationships that have predictive power.

3. \<normalized_uniq_Op\>\<minmax\>\<uniq_Op\>\<Minmax_scaled_unique_operators\>  
   - Reasoning: Scaling the unique operators using min-max normalization could help in comparing this feature more effectively across different samples, especially since it's used in interactions and has a wide range. It can improve model performance by ensuring consistent influence.

3. <log_normalized_lOCode<log<normalized_lOCode<Log_transformed_normalized_line_count>

Explanation:

1. Interaction between difficulty and square root of unique operators: It combines difficulty with a potentially impactful aspect of the code complexity (unique operators), adjusted by taking the square root. This interaction might capture complex interplay between these two code attributes that could be relevant for defect prediction.

2. Square root of log-transformed interaction between difficulty and total operands: This step transforms log_interaction_d_total_Opnd to potentially reveal nuanced patterns by emphasizing smaller values. By taking the square root of a log-transformed feature, minor variations become more pronounced, possibly aiding defect prediction.

3. Log transformed normalized line count: Log transforming normalized line count can adjust for skewness and bring small differences into focus, potentially improving model accuracy by better characterizing modules with few lines of code in relation to defect likelihood.

   Reasoning: Combining line count (lOCode) with square root of unique operators (sqrt_uniq_Op) provides an interaction effect that might be significant in identifying modules with defects. The spread of unique operators across lines could indicate complexity which may influence defect presence.

2. <log_inverse_exp_scaled_lOCode_logd><log><inverse_exp_scaled_lOCode_logd><Log_transformation_of_small_effects_feature>

   Reasoning: Applying a log transformation on the inverse exponentiated scaled line count and log difficulty interaction (inverse_exp_scaled_lOCode_logd) may capture nuances or scale down the values into a more interpretable range, potentially uncovering relationships that assist in defect prediction.

3. <exp_uniq_Op_ratio_diff><diff><exp_uniq_Op_ratio><exp_scaled_lOCode_logd><Difference_between_exponentiated_operator_and_line_difficulty_ratio>

   Reasoning: Taking the difference between exponent readings of operator ratio and scaled line count-log difficulty (exp_uniq_Op_ratio and exp_scaled_lOCode_logd) might highlight discrepancies in complexity versus operators, which could be an indicative metric of defect probability.

   Reasoning: The feature 'inverse_exp_scaled_lOCode_logd' captures small interaction effects in an exponential manner. Applying a logarithm transformation might help normalize its distribution and reveal more nuanced relationships between variables related to software defects.

2. <interaction_d_sqrt_uniq_Op><multiply><d><sqrt_uniq_Op><Interaction_between_Halstead_difficulty_and_square_root_of_unique_operators>
   
   Reasoning: Combining the 'Halstead difficulty' with the square root of unique operators may reveal a compound effect that jointly influences software defects. The interaction between complexity and variety of operators could be a significant contributor to defect occurrence, potentially adding predictive power.

3. <difficulty_line_ratio_log_interaction><multiply><difficulty_line_ratio><log_interaction_d_total_Opnd><Compound_effect_of_difficulty_to_line_ratio_and_log_transformed_interaction_of_difficulty_with_total_operands>

   Reasoning: Creating a feature that captures both the 'difficulty to line ratio' with the 'log transformed interaction between difficulty and total operands' can help emphasize cases where both line complexity and operand interactions might influence defect occurrence. This could help highlight deeper underlying relationships in the dataset.

Explanation:

1. Interaction of Log-transformed Halstead difficulty with exponent of unique operator ratio: By examining the effect of interactions between two features that capture complexity and the uniqueness of operators, we might better understand modules that are at higher risk of defects due to complex and unique operator usage.

2. Ratio of difficulty to line count with normalized Halstead line count: Utilizing line count and its normalized version in conjunction with difficulty to form ratios can help capture nuanced relationships that might be indicative of complex sections of code, possibly highlighting defect-prone areas.

3. Sqrt of exponentiated interaction of scaled line count and log difficulty: Transforming features through square root can help reduce the impact of extreme values, allowing the model to focus on more common values, potentially improving stability and prediction in defect detection.

   Reasoning: Taking the logarithm of the difficulty_line_ratio can help mitigate the effect of extreme values and make the distribution more normal. This can be particularly helpful if the downstream model assumes normally distributed inputs.

2. \<interaction_exp_ratio_logd\> \<multiply\> \<exp_scaled_lOCode_logd\> \<log_d\> \<Interaction_between_exponentiated_scaled_line_count_and_log_difficulty\>
   
   Reasoning: Creating an interaction term between exp_scaled_lOCode_logd and log_d can capture the joint effect of these two features. This interaction could reveal insights that are not visible when examining each feature individually.

3. \<normalized_exp_uniq_Op_ratio\> \<minmax\> \<exp_uniq_Op_ratio\> \<Minmax_normalized_version_of_exp_uniq_Op_ratio_to_scale_feature\>
   
   Reasoning: Applying Min-Max normalization to exp_uniq_Op_ratio will scale this feature to a range of [0, 1]. This is useful for algorithms that perform better on standardized data, especially if the range of the feature is very large and could potentially skew results.

2026-01-30 13:39:11,974 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! For generating new features to improve the downstream model's performance in predicting software defects, it's essential to consider interactions and transformations between the given features. We'll use operations that could unveil additional patterns in the data.

1. Feature 1: Interaction between normalized unique operators and difficulty
   - <normalized_uniq_Op_log_d_multiply><multiply><normalized_uniq_Op><log_d><Interaction_effect_between_normalized_unique_operators_and_log_transformed_Halstead_difficulty>  
   - *Reasoning:* This feature captures the compounded effect of the normalized count of unique operators and the logarithmic transformation of the difficulty. It can highlight modules where both factors may synergistically contribute to increased defect proneness.

2. Feature 2: Combined ratio of unique operators and normalized line count
   - <uniq_Op_ratio_normalized_lOCode_ratio><multiply><uniq_Op_ratio><normalized_lOCode><Combined_ratio_of_unique_operators_and_normalized_line_count>  
   - *Reasoning:* This feature represents the interaction between how unique operators and normalized code lines relate to the total, potentially isolating cases where either both are unusually high or balanced, impacting defect rates.

3. Feature 3: Exponentiated logarithm of difficulty line ratio interaction
   - <exp_difficulty_line_ratio_log_interaction><exp><difficulty_line_ratio_log_interaction><Exponentiated_effect_of_difficulty_line_ratio_interaction>  
   - *Reasoning:* By exponentiating the difficulty line ratio log interaction, this transformation might emphasize the interaction's nonlinear effects, potentially magnifying the significance of subtle differences in less evident cases of defect presence.

These transformations aim to unveil higher-order relationships and nonlinear interactions between the original variables, which could be critical for capturing complex patterns associated with software defects.
