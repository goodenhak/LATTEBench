2026-01-30 14:17:22,347 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps using the provided operations to potentially improve the downstream model's performance. The focus is on creating interactions and transformations that could enhance the prediction of biodegradability.

1. Interaction Terms:
   - Combining chemical structure features may reveal non-linear relationships that could be pivotal for classification. Here, I'm creating a combination of some features:
   plaintext
   <SpMax_L_J_Dz_ratio><divide><SpMax_L><J_Dz(e)><Ratio_of_Leading_Eigenvalue_to_Balaban_Index>
   

2. Transforming and Normalizing Data:
   - Using transformations like the z-score can standardize variables, making them more interpretable and potentially boosting model performance.
   plaintext
   <SM6_L_zscore><zscore><SM6_L><Z-score_Normalized_Spectral_Moment_of_Order_6_From_Laplace_Matrix>
   

3. Polynomial Feature:
   - Sometimes polynomial features can help capture interactions between features. This creates a quadratic term for a feature with a broad range:
   plaintext
   <nHM_squared><square><nHM><Square_of_Number_of_Heavy_Atoms>
    

These steps focus on transforming existing features or creating new ones that might capture crucial interactions or patterns in the dataset. These can be plugged into machine learning models to test their effectiveness in improving biodegradability predictions.

   Rationale: Chemicals with a higher proportion of oxygen might have different biodegradability properties. By calculating the ratio of the number of oxygen atoms to its cumulative sum, we can capture trends over sequences of chemicals which may indicate consistency in necessary oxygen proportion for biodegradability.

2. <F03_CN_SM6_L_product><multiply><F03[C-N]><SM6_L><product_of_F03_CN_and_SM6_L>  
   Rationale: The interaction between the frequency of C-N at a topological distance of 3 and the spectral moment might have a synergistic effect on the biodegradability of the molecule, which could be vital for class prediction.

3. <SpMax_B_m_categorized><bin><SpMax_B(m)><binned_SpMax_B_m>  
   Rationale: Binning the leading eigenvalue from the Burden matrix weighted by mass allows for categorizing chemicals into different clusters based on this descriptor. Binned features can help capture non-linear relationships and potentially improve classification accuracy in certain models.

   - Reasoning: Normalizing 'SpMax_L' using z-score can help in scaling the feature to have mean zero and standard deviation one, thereby enhancing model performance especially in algorithms sensitive to feature scale.

2. <oxygen_ratio><divide><nO><nHM><Ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_heavy_atoms>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen atoms to heavy atoms can be a significant indicator of the molecular structure's influence on biodegradability, and is likely useful to the model.

3. <ring_conjugation><cross><nCb->nCIR><Conjugation_between_substituted_benzene_and_circuit_structures>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between substituted benzene structures and circuit structures could be important for understanding how conjugation impacts biodegradability. Creating a feature capturing this interaction may enhance the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

Such normalization can improve model performance by making feature distribution more uniform.

2. \<nX_presence\>greater\<nX\>0\<presence_of_halogen_atoms\>: This binary feature indicates whether any halogen atoms are present, simplifying the model's task of interpreting the impact of halogens. Halogen atoms may play a role in biodegradability, and focusing on their presence/absence might be beneficial.

3. \<N_and_O_donor_effective_count\>plus\<nN\>\<nHDon\>\<effective_count_of_nitrogen_and_hydrogen_donor_atoms\>: By combining the counts of nitrogen and donor atoms for hydrogen bonds, this feature provides a consolidated count of atoms that could influence biodegradation through hydrogen bonding. This could help the model understand the overall potential for interaction with the environment.

2026-01-30 14:17:58,072 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<nN_ratio_C_to_N\> \<ratio\> \<nN\> \<F02[C-N]\> \<Ratio_of_Nitrogen_atoms_to_C-N_bonds_at_topological_distance_2\>
   - Explanation: This feature calculates the ratio of nitrogen atoms to the frequency of C-N bonds at a topological distance of 2. If a chemical has a lot of nitrogen atoms but relatively fewer C-N bonds at this distance, it might have different properties affecting biodegradability.

2. \<oxygen_ratio_log\> \<log\> \<oxygen_ratio\> \<Log_transformed_ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_heavy_atoms\>
   - Explanation: The range of oxygen_ratio is quite large, and log-transforming this feature can help normalize its distribution, potentially making it more informative for the classification model by highlighting multiplicative rather than additive differences.

3. \<SpMax_B_m_SdO_product\> \<multiply\> \<SpMax_B(m)\> \<SdO\> \<Product_of_SpMax_B_m_and_SdO\>
   - Explanation: This feature represents the interaction between SpMax_B(m), which measures molecular shape related to mass distribution, and SdO, which relates to electronic states of oxygen. The interaction between these two descriptors might capture specific molecular characteristics influential in the biodegradability of a compound.

These new features focus on generating meaningful interactions and transformations that could enhance the model's ability to capture relationships relevant to predicting biodegradability.

3. \<has_halogen\><greater>\<nX\>0\<Binary feature indicating presence of halogen atoms>

### Explanation:
1. Z-score Normalization for oxygen_ratio: Given the large range of the oxygen_ratio feature, we apply z-score normalization to bring the values closer to a standard normal distribution. This can help models that are sensitive to feature scaling, like logistic regression or k-nearest neighbors, to better interpret the feature.

2. Combining Frequencies of C-N Bonds: By adding F02[C-N] and F03[C-N], we generate a new feature that represents the total frequency of C-N bonds across different distances. This feature may capture a broader picture of the molecular connectivity relevant for degradation.

3. Binary Feature for Presence of Halogens: Halogen atoms can significantly affect the chemical and physical properties of molecules. By creating a binary feature that indicates the presence of any halogen atoms (nX > 0), we provide the model with an easily interpretable factor that could differentiate between biodegradable and non-biodegradable compounds.

2026-01-30 14:18:12,345 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible steps to generate features that may improve the downstream model's performance by leveraging chemical property relationships and interactions:

1. C-N Interaction Factor: 
    The frequency of C-N bonds at various distances could be indicative of certain molecular structures that affect biodegradability. By aggregating these interactions, we can capture a comprehensive feature that signifies the presence of C-N interactions in the molecule.

   
   <CN_Interaction_Sum><plus><F02[C-N]><F03[C-N]><Sum_of_C_N_frequencies>
   <CN_Interaction_Total><plus><CN_Interaction_Sum><F04[C-N]><Total_C_N_frequencies_across_distances>
   <CN_Interaction_Average><divide><CN_Interaction_Total><3><Average_frequency_of_C_N_bonds>
   

2. Oxygen-Hydrogen Bonding Potential:
    Oxygen and hydrogen atoms are critical in forming hydrogen bonds, which impact the molecule's polarity and potentially its biodegradability. Establishing a feature that captures this bonding potential can help in understanding relationships related to the molecule's ability to interact with its environment.

   
   <OH_Bonding_Potential><multiply><nHDon><nO><Hydrogen_oxygen_bonding_potential>
   <OH_Bonding_Potential_Scaled><divide><OH_Bonding_Potential><nHM><Normalized_Hydrogen_oxygen_bonding_potential_with_respect_to_heavy_atoms>
   

3. Molecular Polarity Indicator:
    Molecular polarity often affects solubility and biodegradability. Combining electrostatic properties and eigenvalue-based features can provide an insight into the molecule's geometric and electronic attributes that contribute to polarity.

   
   <Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor><multiply><SpMax_B(m)><J_Dz(e)><Indicator_of_electrostatic_influence_and_geometric_structure>
   <Scaled_Polarity_Indicator><divide><Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor><SpMax_L><Normalized_molecular_polarity_indicator>
   

These engineered features aim to capture complex interactions and properties of molecules related to their structural and chemical composition, which might be significant factors in predicting biodegradability.

2026-01-30 14:18:22,018 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the downstream model's performance for classifying the chemicals, feature engineering can focus on creating more insightful features based on the relationships and transformations within the existing data. Here are three proposed steps:

1. Feature Interaction and Normalization:
   - New features can be created by combining key chemical properties and normalizing them to introduce scale-invariant metrics that may better capture the characteristics influencing biodegradability.

2. Exponential Transformations:
   - Applying exponential transformations can highlight the nonlinear aspects of structural influence on biodegradability, accentuating the effects where they may be diminished in larger numerical ranges.

3. Combination of Descriptors:
   - Combining related molecular descriptors could uncover hidden interactions, such as joint influence of nitrogen and oxygen atoms, perhaps indicating particular compound structures more prone or resistant to biodegradation.

Let's implement these with the operations available:

1. Square Transformation of Oxygen Ratio:
    
   <oxygen_ratio_squared><square><oxygen_ratio><Square_of_the_ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_heavy_atoms>
   
   - A square transformation might capture the extent to which higher ratios influence biodegradability, especially given the wide numerical range for oxygen_ratio.

2. Exponential Transformation of Mean Ionization Potential:
   
   <exp_Mi><exp><Mi><Exponential_of_mean_first_ionization_potential_scaled_on_carbon>
   
   - Ionization potential could be exponentially related to chemical activity properties influencing processes like biodegradation, where reactions might amplify with electron availability characteristics.

3. Product of C-N Interaction and Nitrogen Count:
   
   <CN_N_interaction_product><multiply><CN_Interaction_Sum><nN><Product_of_C-N_frequencies_and_number_of_nitrogen_atoms>
   
   - By multiplying the C-N interaction frequencies by the number of nitrogen atoms, the importance of nitrogen-related pathways in the molecular structure affecting biodegradability is enhanced, leveraging combined features for better insights.

These transformations aim to uncover hidden patterns or amplify relationships affecting target classification, thereby potentially improving model performance.

2026-01-30 14:18:27,880 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance for the task of classifying chemicals based on biodegradability:

1. <Nitrogen_Oxygen_Ratio><divide><nN><nO><Ratio_of_Nitrogen_to_Oxygen_atoms>
   - Reasoning: The relationship between nitrogen and oxygen atoms could provide additional insights into the molecule's structure and potential biodegradability. Creating a feature that represents the ratio between these two atom types might help the model capture relevant chemical interactions or properties.

2. <Oxygen_Polarity_Interaction><multiply><oxygen_ratio><Scaled_Polarity_Indicator><Interaction_between_Oxygen_ratio_and_Molecular_Polarity>
   - Reasoning: A molecule’s polarity, combined with the proportion of oxygen atoms, could affect its interaction with biological environments, influencing biodegradability. This new feature aims to capture how these two characteristics together might impact the classification.

3. <CN_Frequency_Sum><plus><F02[C-N]><F03[C-N]><Sum_of_C-N_Frequency_at_Topological_Distance_2_and_3>
   - Reasoning: Frequencies of C-N at different distances could be contributing factors to molecular structure influences on biodegradability. By summing these frequencies from different topological distances, we might capture a more comprehensive view of C-N bonding patterns and their potential effects on the target class.

2026-01-30 14:18:36,074 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the downstream model's performance, effective feature engineering is crucial. Here are three possible next steps for generating new features using the provided operators:

1. <oxygen_scaled_sp_max_ratio><divide><SpMax_B(m)><oxygen_ratio><Ratio_of_SpMax_B(m)_to_oxygen_ratio>

   - Reasoning: By creating a ratio of the Burden matrix's leading eigenvalue weighted by mass (SpMax_B(m)) to the oxygen_ratio, we can capture the influence of molecular mass in relation to the presence of oxygen. This could help the model detect how molecular mass and oxygen prevalence together affect biodegradability.

2. <nHDon_normalized><zscore><nHDon><Z-scored_normalization_of_Hydrogen_donor_atoms>

   - Reasoning: Applying a z-score normalization to the number of donor atoms for H-bonds (nHDon) will center and scale this feature. This transformation can help the model quickly identify outliers and trends in the number of hydrogen-bond donors without being influenced by the presence of other numerical features with different distributions.

3. <CN_OH_interaction><plus><CN_Interaction_Sum><OH_Bonding_Potential><Combined_CN_and_OH_Interaction_Potential>

   - Reasoning: By summing CN_Interaction_Sum and OH_Bonding_Potential, we create a feature capturing the combined interaction potential of carbon-nitrogen and hydrogen-oxygen. This feature might help enhance the understanding of chemical interactions and their roles in biodegradability.

2026-01-30 14:18:51,029 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps that might help improve the performance of the downstream model by generating new features:

1. \<Oxygen_to_Nitrogen_Ratio\><divide>\<nO\>\<nN\><Ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_nitrogen_atoms_to_assess_relative_abundance>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms in a molecule can offer insights into the composition's potential reactivity and degradability. This feature can be important since both oxygen and nitrogen atoms play critical roles in biodegradability.

2. \<SpMax_L_and_Electrostatic_Interaction\><multiply>\<SpMax_L\>\<Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor\><Interaction_between_leading_eigenvalue_and_electrostatic_influence>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between geometric structure (SpMax_L) and electrostatic influence, potentially highlighting complex relationships that might drive biodegradability. Multiplying these features gives a compounded effect of molecular shape and polarity.

3. \<Normalized_Mass_Related_Moment\><zscore>\<SM6_B(m)\><Standardized_spectral_moment_of_order_6_relating_to_molecular_mass>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the SM6_B(m) feature could enhance its comparability and prominence to assist in distinguishing between the classes, emphasizing differences that are critical in relative mass-weighted properties. Standardization (z-score) can help in reducing skewness and providing a leveled basis for evaluating new samples.

   <CN_Topological_Distance_Diff><subtract><F04[C-N]><F03[C-N]><Difference_in_C-N_Topological_Distance>
   

3. Capture the non-linear relationship between hydrogen bonding and biodegradability. Use the exponential of OH_Bonding_Potential to reflect higher order effects of hydrogen bonding.

   plaintext
   <Exp_OH_Bonding_Potential><exp><OH_Bonding_Potential><Exponential_of_OH_Bonding_Potential>
   

These steps target creating mixed and non-linear features that may better capture the chemical characteristics influencing biodegradability, potentially enhancing the model's performance.

2026-01-30 14:19:34,402 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <oxygen_heavy_ratio_log_ratio>log<ratio_Oxygen_Heavy><Log_Oxygen_Ratio><Log_of_ratio_Oxygen_Heavy_comparing_to_Log_Oxygen_Ratio>
    - Reasoning: This feature attempts to capture the hierarchical relation or proportional change in the logarithmic scale between the ratio_Oxygen_Heavy and the Log_Oxygen_Ratio, which might help identify threshold effects or non-linear relationships affecting biodegradability.

2. <interaction_sum_sqrt>sqrt<CN_Interaction_Sum><Square_root_of_CN_Interaction_Sum_to_reduce_skewness>
    - Reasoning: The square root transformation can help reduce the skewness of the CN_Interaction_Sum which often helps in normalizing data and emphasizing differentiation in regions where original values were closely spaced. It may also highlight subtle differences in the CN interactions that influence biodegradability.

3. <scaled_SpMax_L_normalized>minmax<SpMax_L_normalized><Scaled_Version_of_SpMax_L_normalized>
    - Reasoning: Scaling the SpMax_L_normalized feature to a range between 0 and 1 can help ensure that all features have a similar scale, which typically aids algorithms such as those using gradient descent converge faster and improve performance when features are more comparable in magnitude.

2026-01-30 14:19:42,239 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the given operations, with reasoning:

1. Consider Non-linearity with Interactions
   - Combining features through multiplication can help capture interactions or non-linear relationships between them, which might be useful for the classification task.

   plaintext
   <Oxygen_Mi_Interaction><multiply><oxygen_ratio><Mi><Interaction_between_oxygen_ratio_and_ionization_potential_to_check_non_linearity>
   

2. Explore Relationship between Atom Counts
   - Combining the counts of different types of atoms could reveal patterns specific to certain classes. This can be particularly relevant for biodegradability, where the presence and interaction of different atom types can influence chemical behavior.

   plaintext
   <Total_Atom_Count><plus><nO><nN><Combined_count_of_oxygen_and_nitrogen_atoms_to_evaluate_total_impact>
   <Oxygen_Atom_Ratio><divide><nO><nHM><Ratio_of_oxygen_to_heavy_atoms_to_examine_biodegradability_impact>
   

3. Generate Simplified Polarity Indicators
   - Instead of using polarity in its current form, a transformation like the square root can help emphasize moderate polarity values while reducing the impact of very high values, which can be helpful if the data is skewed.

   plaintext
   <Root_Squared_Polarity_Indicator><sqrt><Squared_Polarity_Indicator><Square_root_of_polarity_indicator_to_balance_emphasis_on_moderate_values>
   

These steps are aimed at exploring potential non-linear and interaction effects among features, as well as normalizing the distribution of certain features to potentially improve model performance on the classification task.

   - Reasoning: In the examples provided, oxygen_ratio and ratio_Oxygen_Heavy typically have the same values, but identifying cases where they diverge could provide insights into particular molecular structures or inaccuracies in measurement that might affect biodegradability class.

2. <High_Electrostatic_Charge><greater><Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor><12><Binary_indicator_if_electrostatic_charge_is_high>
   - Reasoning: The third quartile of Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor is at 13.297, which means a significant portion of molecules might have lower values. Creating a binary feature indicating high electrostatic charge might help categorize molecules into classes indicative of specific properties affecting biodegradability.

3. <Normalized_Oxygen><minmax><nO><Normalized_count_of_oxygen_atoms_between_0_and_1>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing the count of oxygen atoms (nO) to a normalized range could help balance the influence of this feature when combined with others. Given the critical role oxygen atoms play in biodegradability, a normalized measure could improve class separation.

2026-01-30 14:20:06,403 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <SpMax_L_ratio><divide><SpMax_L><SpMax_B(m)><Ratio_of_the_leading_eigenvalue_from_Laplace_and_Burden_matrix_weighted_by_mass>
   - Reasoning: By calculating the ratio of the leading eigenvalues from different matrix representations (Laplace and Burden), we can gain insights into the chemical structure's complexity and connectivity which may be indicative of its biodegradability.

2. <Normalized_Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor><zscore><Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor><Standardized_version_of_Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the Electrostatic Eigen Factor can help in emphasizing deviations from the mean across samples, which might help in detecting unique electrostatic influences in chemical structures that could affect biodegradability.

3. <nO_to_Total_N_O_Atoms><ratio><nO><Total_N_O_Atoms><Ratio_of_number_of_oxygen_atoms_to_combined_count_of_nitrogen_and_oxygen_atoms>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen atoms to the total number of nitrogen and oxygen atoms could highlight the relative oxygen content as compared to nitrogen, providing insights regarding the chemical's propensity for reactivity and potential biodegradability.

2026-01-30 14:20:12,141 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Based on the provided features and descriptions, here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to potentially improve the model's performance:

1. \<oxygen_ratio_log_transform\><log>\<oxygen_ratio\>\<Log_transform_of_oxygen_ratio_for_skewness\>

   - Reasoning: Although the Log_Oxygen_Ratio already exists, recalculating and verifying log transformation directly from oxygen_ratio might reveal discrepancies or missing details in skewness adjustments.

2. \<nO_ratio_Oxygen_Heavy\><ratio>\<nO>\<ratio_Oxygen_Heavy\>\<Ratio_of_number_of_oxygen_atoms_to_ratio_Oxygen_Heavy\>

   - Reasoning: Creating a feature that represents the relative proportion of actual oxygen atoms to the ratio of oxygen to heavy atoms could reveal novel influences on biodegradability that aren't captured by individual values.

3. \<Electro_Std\><zscore>\<Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor\>\<Standardized_electrostatic_eigen_factor\>

   - Reasoning: Standardizing Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor using z-score can help normalize variations and potentially highlight differences between chemicals with diverse electrostatic influences, which may be essential for distinguishing biodegradability.

These new features aim to capture and standardize potential relationships and distributions within the dataset that might not be explicitly represented by the existing features, possibly leading to better classification performance.

2026-01-30 14:20:29,088 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three feature engineering steps using the provided operators to generate new features, potentially improving the downstream model's performance by enhancing the information captured regarding biodegradability:

1. \<max_Oxygen_Ratio\> <max> \<oxygen_ratio\> \<ratio_Oxygen_Heavy\> \<Maximum_value_between_oxygen_ratio_and_ratio_Oxygen_Heavy>\

   Reasoning: The oxygen_ratio and ratio_Oxygen_Heavy seem to represent similar concepts related to the proportion of oxygen atoms in the molecule. Taking the maximum value between these two features may emphasize the higher influence of oxygen, impacting a molecule's biodegradability readiness.

2. \<effective_SdO_ratio\> <divide> \<SdO\> \<nO\> \<SdO_donminated_by_oxygen_atoms>\

   Reasoning: The SdO (sum of dO E-states) divided by the number of oxygen atoms (nO) provides an effective measure of electronic state influence per oxygen atom present in the molecule, which may correlate with biodegradation processes.

3. \<Polar_Interaction_Sum\> <plus> \<Squared_Polarity_Indicator\> \<CN_Interaction_Sum\> \<Combined_metric_for_polarity_and_interactions>\

   Reasoning: By combining Squared_Polarity_Indicator and CN_Interaction_Sum, we can generate a metric that accounts for the cumulative influence of molecular polarity and carbon-nitrogen interactions. This could affect molecular structure stability and its potential biodegradability. 

These engineered features can provide a new perspective on how chemical attributes contribute to biodegradability prediction.

2026-01-30 14:20:37,020 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's create three potential new features using the provided operators, designed to improve the predictive performance of the downstream task, specifically, the classification of chemicals into ready and not ready biodegradable categories.

### Potential Feature Engineering Steps:

1. Feature: Oxygen to Carbon Ratio
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen atoms to carbon atoms in a chemical may provide insights into the chemical's polarity and possible reactivity, potentially affecting its biodegradability. This assumes that a higher oxygen content relevant to carbon may enhance solubility and biodegradability.
   - 
     <oxygen_to_carbon_ratio><divide><nO><C%><Ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_carbon_atoms>
     

2. Feature: Interaction of Electrostatic Factors and Connnectivity
   - Reasoning: The electrostatic properties and connectivity indices combined may unveil patterns that are correlated with biodegradability. Significant interactions might highlight specific structural or electrostatic properties influencing how a chemical degrades.
   - 
     <electrostatic_connectivity_interaction><multiply><Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor><Psi_i_A><Interaction_between_electrostatic_eigen_factor_and_intrinsic_state_pseudoconnectivity>
     

3. Feature: Combined Frequency of Bond Types
   - Reasoning: Combining the interactions of different bond types (C-N, C-O, C-Cl, C-Br) can aggregate how different functional groups contribute collectively to biodegradability. This focuses on the variability and distribution of functional groups as a whole in influencing degradation potential.
   - 
     <combined_bond_frequency><plus><F03[C-N]><F03[C-O]><Combined_frequency_of_C-N_and_C-O_bonds>
     <combined_bond_frequency><plus><combined_bond_frequency><B03[C-Cl]><Combined_frequency_with_C-Cl_bond>
     <combined_bond_frequency><plus><combined_bond_frequency><B01[C-Br]><Combined_frequency_with_C-Br_bond>
     

These features are proposed with the assumption that they might capture intricate relationships within the data that the current set of features does not fully reveal. By calculating ratios, interactions, and combined frequencies, we can potentially highlight critical aspects of structural and compositional attributes that impact chemical biodegradability.

2026-01-30 14:20:43,077 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the downstream model's performance, we can generate new features that capture important relationships and patterns in the data. Here are three possible next steps using the available operations:

1. \<interaction_term_1\>\<multiply\>\<Mi\>\<nO\>\<Interaction_between_mean_ionization_potential_and_number_of_oxygen_atoms>
   - Reasoning: By creating an interaction term between the mean first ionization potential (Mi) and the number of oxygen atoms (nO), we may capture complex chemical interactions affecting biodegradability.

2. \<normalized_carbon_percentage\>\<minmax\>\<C%\>\<Min_max_normalization_of_Carbon_percentage_to_handle_non_uniform_distribution>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the percentage of carbon atoms (C%) could help in mitigating potential effects of its non-uniform distribution, allowing the model to treat it on a standardized scale.

3. \<oxygen_heavy_atom_log_ratio\>\<log\>\<ratio_Oxygen_Heavy\>\<Log_transformed_ratio_of_oxygen_to_heavy_atoms_to_emphasize_non_linear_relationships>
   - Reasoning: Applying a log transformation to the ratio of oxygen to heavy atoms (ratio_Oxygen_Heavy) may help in managing skewness and uncover non-linear relationships with biodegradability.

These steps are aimed at enhancing the feature space to better capture relevant chemical characteristics influencing the biodegradability classification task.

2026-01-30 14:20:53,670 - INFO - LLM Output: Below are three potential feature engineering steps using the given operators to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<Logarithmic_SpMax_L\><log>\<SpMax_L\>\<Logarithm_of_SpMax_L_to_reduce_skewness\>
   - Reasoning: Taking the logarithm of the SpMax_L feature can help reduce skewness, potentially leading to a better representation for modeling purposes.

2. \<High_C_N_ratio\><divide>\<F02[C-N]\>\<F03[C-N]\>\<Ratio_of_C_N_frequencies_at_distances_2_and_3\>
   - Reasoning: Computing the ratio of C-N frequencies at different topological distances might provide insights into the spatial arrangement of atoms, which could influence biodegradability.

3. \<Normalized_Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor\><minmax>\<Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor\>\<Range_normalized_electrostatic_feature_for_scale_effect\>
   - Reasoning: Applying min-max normalization to Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor scales the values between 0 and 1, maintaining relative differences and potentially improving model performance by making this feature more comparable across samples.

2026-01-30 14:20:59,521 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps for generating new features, along with explanations for each:

1. Exponential Feature for Non-linear Effects  
   <exp_SpMax_L_normalized><exp><SpMax_L_normalized><Use_exponential_transformation_to_capture_potential_non_linear_relationships_associated_with_feature>  
   Explanation: Exponential transformations can help emphasize differences among smaller values and handle potential non-linear effects of features on the target label, especially when the feature values are normally distributed around zero. This could enhance the predictive power if non-linear patterns exist.

2. Ratio of Carbon Percentage to Heavy Atoms  
   <carbon_to_heavy_ratio><divide><C%><nHM><Potential_importance_of_carbon_density_in_chemical_structure_related_to_biodegradability>  
   Explanation: Creating a ratio of carbon to heavy atoms can reveal the density and distribution of carbon within the molecule, possibly impacting biodegradability. Since carbon is a basic building block, its proportion relative to other heavy atoms can be a critical factor in determining chemical properties.

3. Log Transformation for Frequency Interaction  
   <log_CN_Interaction_Sum><log><CN_Interaction_Sum><Mitigate_skewness_and_high_variance_in_CN_interaction_frequencies>  
   Explanation: Applying a log transformation to the CN_Interaction_Sum can reduce skewness and variance, making this feature potentially more informative by normalizing its distribution. This may improve model performance in cases where such frequency counts have a wide range influencing target prediction.

2026-01-30 14:21:05,077 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to enhance the downstream model's performance:

1. <Log_N_O_Ratio><log><Total_N_O_Atoms><Log of total nitrogen and oxygen atoms ratio>
   - Reasoning: Since both nitrogen and oxygen atoms are key indicators for biodegradability, taking the logarithm of their combined count might help normalize the distribution and better capture their effect on the target class.

2. <SpMax_B_m_squared><square><SpMax_B(m)><Square of SpMax_B(m) to emphasize its variations>
   - Reasoning: Squaring the leading eigenvalue from the Burden matrix weighted by mass could highlight its contribution to molecular stability or interaction dynamics, potentially improving classification accuracy.

3. <Normalized_C_N_Interaction><zscore><CN_Interaction_Total><Z-score normalization of CN interaction total>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the total C-N interaction frequencies can help in managing varying scales and better integrate this feature into other numerical features for the model, potentially revealing patterns in chemical connectivity that influence biodegradability.

2026-01-30 14:21:10,372 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<Heavy_Oxygen_Ratio\><divide>\<nO\>\<nHM\><Ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_heavy_atoms_improving_over_existing_ratio_feature>  
   Reasoning: The existing features oxygen_ratio and ratio_Oxygen_Heavy have similar values. Explicitly calculating the Heavy_Oxygen_Ratio may provide more meaningful insight when considering the actual number of oxygen vs. heavy atoms, focusing directly on molecular structure. 

2. \<Log_SpMax_B(m)\><log>\<SpMax_B(m)\><Log_transform_of_SpMax_B(m)_to_handle_skewness>  
   Reasoning: Transforming SpMax_B(m) could help reduce skewness and make patterns more visible to the model, as log transforms are generally effective for features with large ranges or skewness.

3. \<C-N_influence_factor\><multiply>\<F02[C-N]\>\<F03[C-N]\><Interaction_between_C-N_at_different_distances_emphasizing_biodegradability_influence>  
   Reasoning: Biodegradability may be affected by the frequencies of C-N interactions at different topological distances. By multiplying these features, the interaction factor between the two can provide more comprehensive insight into chemical behavior.

2026-01-30 14:21:16,214 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the model's performance in classifying chemical biodegradability:

1. \<High_Oxygen_Ratio_Flag\> \<greater\> \<oxygen_ratio\> \<2000000.0\> \<Binary indicator if the oxygen_ratio is greater than 2000000.0\>  
   - Reasoning: Given that \(Q3\) for the oxygen_ratio is 2,000,000, this step creates a binary feature to distinguish chemicals with exceptionally high oxygen_ratios, which could influence biodegradability. 

2. \<Scaled_CN_Interactions\> \<zscore\> \<CN_Interaction_Total\> \<Z-score scaling to normalize total CN interactions\>
   - Reasoning: The distribution of CN interactions might not be centered around zero, and normalization could help mitigate the effect of outliers, enhancing the model's ability to identify meaningful patterns related to CN interactions and biodegradability. 

3. \<Oxygen_Nitrogen_Ratio\> \<ratio\> \<nO\> \<nN\> \<Ratio of oxygen atoms to nitrogen atoms\>
   - Reasoning: The balance between oxygen and nitrogen atoms could provide insights into chemical structure characteristics that influence biodegradability, and capturing this through a ratio might enhance prediction ability.

Explanation:

1. Square of Normalized SpMax_L: The feature SpMax_L_normalized is normalized, which means there are both positive and negative values. Squaring this will emphasize high absolute values and could elucidate subtle nonlinear relationships by giving more weight to outliers.

2. Ratio of Oxygen to Heavy Atoms: Creating a ratio between the number of oxygen atoms (nO) and the number of heavy atoms (nHM) might provide insights into biodegradability linked to oxygen content relative to the molecule's size. This can help identify the relative oxygen concentration effect, potentially illuminating its contribution to the response variable.

3. Log Transformation of Squared Polarity Indicator: The squared polarity indicator seems to have a positively skewed distribution which can still benefit from a log transformation. This transformation can stabilize the variance and make features more Gaussian-like, potentially improving the robustness and interpretability for downstream models.

2026-01-30 14:21:28,294 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<Heavy_Atom_To_C_Ratio\> \<divide\> \<nHM\> \<C%\> \<Ratio_of_heavy_atoms_to_percentage_of_carbon_atoms\>: The rationale here is to create a feature that relates the number of heavy atoms to the carbon atom percentage. This might help illuminate the structural properties of the molecule affecting biodegradability.

2. \<Normalized_Polarity_Indicator\> \<minmax\> \<Squared_Polarity_Indicator\> \<Normalized_version_of_Squared_Polarity_Indicator\>: Since Squared_Polarity_Indicator can have a wide range, normalizing it to a common scale with a min-max operation might enhance the model's ability to learn from this feature effectively.

3. \<Oxygen_Nitrogen_Impact\> \<plus\> \<nO\> \<nN\> \<Impact_of_combined_oxygen_and_nitrogen_atom_count_on_biodegradability\>: Combining the number of oxygen and nitrogen atoms might highlight the significance of these elements in determining biodegradability, as both often play critical roles in the chemical processes involved in biodegradation.

   Reasoning: This feature attempts to balance the skewness and reduce the impact of high magnitude values by comparing the log-transformed oxygen ratio directly with the raw ratio of oxygen to heavy atoms.

2. <nO_squared><square><nO><Square_of_number_of_oxygen_atoms>

   Reasoning: Squaring the number of oxygen atoms might emphasize its effect, especially on properties and reactions that are nonlinear with respect to the number of oxygen atoms. This could help capture important nonlinear relationships in the data.

3. <CN_Oxygen_Interaction><plus><CN_Interaction_Sum><F03[C-O]><Sum_of_CN_and_CO_interactions_at_specific_distances>

   Reasoning: Summing interactions between CN and CO frequencies might capture complex molecular interactions that affect biodegradability, considering both nitrogen and oxygen interactions at specific distances.

   - This feature provides a modified version of the existing oxygen_ratio and ratio_Oxygen_Heavy attributes by ensuring that division by zero does not occur. Many chemicals have zero heavy atoms, which could cause division errors in the original feature. This adjusted ratio provides a more robust comparison metric for biodegradability prediction.

2. <normalized_log_oxygen_ratio><zscore><Log_Oxygen_Ratio><Normalized_version_of_Log_Oxygen_Ratio_to_reduce_skewness>  
   - The feature Log_Oxygen_Ratio has significant skewness, with a wide range of values. Applying z-score normalization makes it easier for the model to interpret the data and allows it to focus less on the scale and more on the actual values' relationship, thereby potentially improving prediction accuracy.

3. <polarity_combined_factor><multiply><Squared_Polarity_Indicator><Scaled_SM6_B_m><Interaction_between_squared_polarity_and_spectral_moment_to_capture_complex_relationship>  
   - By multiplying the squared polarity indicator by the scaled spectral moment, this feature attempts to capture the interaction effect between molecular polarity and structural configuration. This derived interaction could highlight patterns connected to biodegradability, which individual features might miss.

These steps leverage mathematical transformations and interaction terms to address issues such as skewness, scaling, and interaction effects, ultimately aiming to enhance model predictions in classifying chemical biodegradability.

2026-01-30 14:22:19,014 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for generating new features to potentially improve the performance of your downstream model.

1. <C_N_Interaction_Ratio><divide><CN_Interaction_Sum><Total_N_O_Atoms><Ratio_of_C-N_frequencies_to_total_N_and_O_atoms>
    - Rationale: This feature calculates the ratio of C-N interaction sums to the total count of nitrogen and oxygen atoms. It highlights the potential significance of C-N interactions relative to the presence of N and O atoms in a molecule, which might influence biodegradability.

2. <High_Polarity_Indicator><greater><Squared_Polarity_Indicator><10><Indicator_for_high_polarity_values_above_10>
    - Rationale: This binary feature marks molecules with a squared polarity indicator above a threshold (e.g., 10). Molecules with higher polarity might affect biodegradability, so highlighting them as a distinct category can help the model in classification tasks.

3. <Oxygen_to_Heavy_Atoms_Difference><subtract><nO><nHM><Difference_between_number_of_oxygen_atoms_and_heavy_atoms>
    - Rationale: By determining the difference between the number of oxygen and heavy atoms, this feature might capture how the relative abundance of oxygen impacts the chemical's properties. Such a difference could play a role in predicting biodegradability, given the chemical significance of oxygen.

These new features aim to capture different aspects of chemical interactions and compositions that may impact biodegradability, providing additional patterns for the model to detect and thereby potentially improving prediction accuracy.

2026-01-30 14:22:25,719 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature generation using the given operators and dataset:

1. <log_total_n_o_atoms><log><Total_N_O_Atoms><Log_transformation_of_Total_N_O_Atoms_to_reduce_skewness>
   - The Total_N_O_Atoms feature might exhibit a skewed distribution due to its count nature. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help to reduce skewness and bring the feature closer to a normal distribution, which may improve model performance.

2. <oxygen_to_nitrogen_ratio><divide><nO><nN><Ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_nitrogen_atoms_focusing_on_relative_oxygen_prevalence>
   - This feature calculates the ratio of oxygen atoms to nitrogen atoms, focusing on the relative prevalence of oxygen in the molecules. This may have implications for biodegradability, given the chemical differences between oxygen and nitrogen.

3. <weighted_electrostatic_factor><multiply><Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor><Psi_i_A><Weighted_electrostatic_factor_considering_intrinsic_pseudoconnectivity>
   - Multiplying the Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor with the Psi_i_A (intrinsic pseudoconnectivity index) creates a feature that captures the interaction between electrostatic influence and connectivity within the molecule. This weighted factor may provide a more comprehensive view of electrostatic potential effects.

2026-01-30 14:22:32,748 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <Oxygen_Heavy_Reciprocal><reciprocal><ratio_Oxygen_Heavy><Reciprocal_of_ratio_of_oxygen_to_heavy_atoms_to_handle_outliers>
   - Reasoning: By taking the reciprocal of ratio_Oxygen_Heavy, which has a very high range and high skewness, we can mitigate the impact of extreme values and potentially improve the model’s ability to generalize. This transformation can help avoid problems associated with large or dominating numeric values.

2. <Normalized_CRatio><minmax><C%><Normalized_percentage_of_C_atoms>
   - Reasoning: Applying Min-Max scaling to C% will rescale the range of this feature to be between 0 and 1. This could help models that are sensitive to the scale of input features, such as neural networks, in improving convergence and predictive performance.

3. <CN_O_Ratio><divide><CN_Interaction_Total><Total_N_O_Atoms><Ratio_of_CN_interaction_Total_to_Total_N_O_Atoms>
   - Reasoning: Creating a new feature by taking the ratio of CN_Interaction_Total to Total_N_O_Atoms could capture an important relationship between CN interactions and the total count of nitrogen and oxygen atoms. This may reveal hidden patterns related to the chemical structure’s potential for biodegradability, leading to better classification performance.

2026-01-30 14:22:38,426 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we'll focus on generating new features that could better capture potential interactions or non-linear relationships between existing features. Here are three suggested steps:

1. Leveraging the high variance of oxygen-related features:
   - <oxygen_variance_ratio>divide<Std><Mean><Ratio_of_standard_deviation_and_mean_for_oxygen_ratio_features>
   - Explanation: This feature emphasizes variability in oxygen ratios, which might help in distinguishing chemical properties affecting biodegradability.

2. Exploring interactions between polarity and electrostatic effects:
   - <polarity_electrostatic_interaction>multiply<Squared_Polarity_Indicator><Electrostatic_Eigen_Factor><Interaction_between_polarity_and_electrostatic_influence>
   - Explanation: By interacting the squared polarity indicator with the electrostatic eigen factor, we might capture the combined influence on chemical reactivity and biodegradability.

3. Capturing complexity of C-N interactions:
   - <CN_Interaction_Complexity>sqrt<CN_Interaction_Total><Square_root_of_total_CN_interaction_frequencies>
   - Explanation: Taking the square root of total C-N interaction frequencies allows us to highlight intermediate-level interactions, potentially correlating with chemical complexity and biodegradability.
