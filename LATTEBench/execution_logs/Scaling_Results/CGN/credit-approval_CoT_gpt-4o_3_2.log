2026-01-30 12:57:47,921 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps for feature engineering to potentially improve the prediction of credit card application success:

1. \<PriorDefault_Income_ratio\><ratio><Income><PriorDefault\><Ratio_of_income_to_prior_default_status\>
   - Reasoning: Understanding the ratio of income to prior default status could reveal insights about how applicants with different financial backgrounds behave in terms of defaults. This might help in assessing their creditworthiness.

2. \<CreditIndustry_BankCustomer_cross\><cross><CreditIndustry><BankCustomer\><Interaction_between_credit_industry_and_bank_customer_status\>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between an applicant's industry and their bank customer status could capture complex relationships that signify their financial stability and affect the likelihood of credit card approval.

3. \<Employed_YearsEmployed_product\><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed\><Effect_of_employment_status_and_experience_on_credit_card_success\>
   - Reasoning: Combining employment status with years of employment provides a comprehensive understanding of an applicant's job stability and experience, which can be critical factors in assessing credit card application success.

2026-01-30 12:57:53,316 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the credit card application prediction task:

1. \<CreditScore_YearsEmployed_ratio\> \<divide\> \<CreditScore\> \<YearsEmployed\> \<ratio_of_credit_score_to_years_employed_provides_insight_into_how_an_applicant's_credit_score_relates_to_their_professional_stability\>

   - Reasoning: Applicants who have a higher credit score relative to their years of employment might indicate responsible financial behavior or maturity at a young career stage. This feature could capture such relationships and enable better prediction of creditworthiness.

2. \<Citizen_encoded\> \<label_encode\> \<Citizen\> \<convert_categorical_citizenship_status_into_numerical_form_for_model_input\>

   - Reasoning: By converting the 'Citizen' categorical feature into numerical form, we enable the model to process and learn from the differences in creditworthiness based on citizenship status, potentially highlighting access to credit based on citizenship type.

3. \<CreditScore_Industry_relation\> \<cross\> \<CreditScore\> \<CreditIndustry\> \<interaction_between_credit_score_and_industry_emphasizes_differences_in_creditworthiness_across_industries\>

   - Reasoning: Certain industries might generally have employees with higher or lower credit scores. By creating an interaction feature between credit score and industry, this step could improve the model's ability to distinguish between applicants based on how their industry might influence credit score norms.

2026-01-30 12:58:05,362 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps that could help improve the prediction of successful credit card applications:

1. Creating an interaction between employment and income:
   - <>employment_income_ratio<ratio<YearsEmployed<Income<The_ratio_of_years_employed_to_income
   - Reasoning: The ratio of years employed to income could capture the stability and progression of an individual's career, which could be indicative of creditworthiness.

2. Combining indicators of financial stability:
   - <>financial_stability_index<concat<BankCustomer<DriversLicense<A_concatenation_of_bank_customer_and_driver's_license_status>
   - Reasoning: Combining bank customer status with driver's license status may capture a broader aspect of the person's stability and legitimacy in financial dealings.

3. Addressing the significance of previous defaults:
   - <>inverse_prior_default<reciprocal<PriorDefault<Inverse_of_prior_default_as_a_resilience_indicator>
   - Reasoning: The inverse of prior defaults might help capture the resilience or reliability against defaults, giving a different perspective on the relationship between prior default status and creditworthiness.

These engineered features are designed to introduce new aspects of financial behavior and stability that might be predictive of successful credit card applications.

2026-01-30 12:58:19,789 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature generation, aiming to improve the predictive performance of the downstream model:

1. Interaction Between CreditIndustry and Income  
   Interaction features can capture the combined effect of categorical and numerical features, potentially revealing complex patterns related to the target variable.

   <CreditIndustry_Income_interaction><cross><CreditIndustry><Income><capturing_combined_influence_of_industry_and_income_on_credit_success>

2. Normalization of YearsEmployed  
   Normalizing numerical features can improve model convergence and allow algorithms to learn effectively by ensuring features are on a similar scale.

   <YearsEmployed_normalized><minmax><YearsEmployed><normalization_of_years_employed_to_improve_scale_balance>

3. PriorDefault Influence on Income-YearsEmployed Ratio  
   By interacting PriorDefault with a financial ratio, we can assess how past defaults modify the relationship between income and employment duration, which could be critical for predicting credit card success.

2026-01-30 12:58:28,345 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <PriorDefault_BankCustomer_combined><cross><PriorDefault><BankCustomer><interaction_between_prior_default_and_bank_customer_enhancing_risk_evaluation>
   
   Reasoning: By using the cross operator to combine 'PriorDefault' and 'BankCustomer', we create a feature that may capture individuals' differing levels of credit risk based on past default behavior in conjunction with bank account ownership.

2. <YearsEmployed_log_transformed><log><YearsEmployed><log_transformation_of_years_employed_reduces_skewness_and_handles_zero_employment_experience>

   Reasoning: 'YearsEmployed' has a wide range and potentially skewed distribution. Applying a log transformation can help in reducing the skewness, especially for individuals with low employment years, making the feature more informative and better suited for linear models.

3. <CreditScore_Income_product><multiply><CreditScore_encoded><Income><product_of_credit_score_and_income_highlights_financial_standing_within_creditworthiness_context>

   Reasoning: Creating a feature by multiplying 'CreditScore_encoded' and 'Income' combines credit score and financial capacity information into a single metric that might more effectively capture an individual's creditworthiness and payment capacity.

2026-01-30 12:58:43,467 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps to enhance the performance of the downstream task of predicting successful credit card applications:

1. \<Default_CreditScore_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<PriorDefault\> \<CreditScore_encoded\> \<Interaction between prior default and credit score to highlight risk levels\>

   Reasoning: Combining a customer's prior default history with their credit score can provide a more nuanced indicator of creditworthiness. High credit scores paired with no prior defaults might signal high reliability, while low scores and a history of defaults might indicate higher risk.

2. \<IncomeEmployed_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<Income\> \<Employed\> \<Interacting income with employment status to evaluate financial stability\>

   Reasoning: This feature captures financial stability by considering both income and employment status. A consistently high income despite no employment could indicate other income sources or irregular employment. Conversely, a low-income potential could be a negative sign despite employment.

3. \<BankCustomer_Gender_interaction\> \<cross\> \<BankCustomer\> \<Gender\> \<Interaction between bank account ownership and gender to expose possible differences in financial behavior\>

   Reasoning: Exploring potential differences in credit card application success rates by gender and bank account ownership reveals insights into patterns of financial behavior and possibly cultural or systemic biases that may exist within these groups.

2026-01-30 12:59:09,739 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<Employed_Married_cross\>\<cross\>\<Employed\>\<Married\>\<Interaction_term_to_capture_combined_effect_of_employment_and_marital_status_on_credit_card_application_success\>  
   Reasoning: Combining the employment and marital status might provide insights into how these social attributes interact with credit card application success. Both factors are often proxies for stability in life which could impact creditworthiness.

2. \<Income_DriversLicense_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<Income\>\<DriversLicense\>\<Ratio_of_income_to_ownership_of_drivers_license_indicating_financial_independence_relative_to_transport_access\>  
   Reasoning: By creating a ratio of income to the possession of a driver's license, we can ascertain whether financial means are directly linked to the ability to afford personal transportation, an indicator of financial independence which often correlates with higher credit card application success.

3. \<CreditScore_Employed_interaction\>\<cross\>\<CreditScore_encoded\>\<Employed\>\<Interaction_between_credit_score_and_employment_status_that_helps_identify_higher_creditworthiness_in_employed_individuals\>  
   Reasoning: An interaction between credit score and employment status can capture the nuanced impact of stable income sources (employment) on credit management capabilities (credit score), thereby influencing credit card application success.

By considering these interactions and ratios, we enhance feature richness, enabling better differentiation and predictive power regarding which individuals are likely to be successful in credit card applications.

   * Reasoning: The Income feature has a significant range and is highly skewed, as seen from its statistics. Applying square root transformation can help in handling the skewness and highlight relative differences in income levels, which might be crucial for identifying credit card approval chances.

2. <PriorDefault_BankCustomer_encoded><label_encode><PriorDefault_BankCustomer_interaction><convert_interaction_of_prior_default_and_bank_customer_status_to_numerical_to_facilitate_better_relationship_analysis>

   * Reasoning: Converting the interaction feature 'PriorDefault_BankCustomer_interaction' into numerical format using label encoding may facilitate better analysis in models that prefer numerical inputs, possibly improving the model's ability to capture correlations with other numerical features.

3. <YearsEmployed_cube><cube><YearsEmployed><highlight_long_term_employment_through_cubing_to_emphasize_income_stability>

   * Reasoning: Cubing the YearsEmployed feature can accentuate individuals with longer employment histories, which are often associated with financial stability, thus potentially increasing their likelihood of credit card approval.

2026-01-30 12:59:31,774 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the predictions of successful credit card applications:

1. <YearsEmployed_sqrt><sqrt><YearsEmployed><apply_square_root_transformation_on_YearsEmployed_to_reduce_skewness_in_employment_duration>
   - Reasoning: The YearsEmployed feature is skewed due to many applicants having a short employment time. Applying a square root transformation can reduce skewness and make the data more suitable for modeling, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

2. <Income_log><log><Income><apply_log_transformation_on_Income_to_handle_large_variance_and_skewness>
   - Reasoning: The Income feature has a large range and potentially a long-tail distribution. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help stabilize variance and normalize the distribution, making it easier for the model to learn.

3. <CreditScore_ZipCode_cross><cross><CreditScore_encoded><ZipCode><interaction_between_CreditScore_and_ZipCode_to_identify_regional_patterns_in_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By creating an interaction between CreditScore_encoded and ZipCode, we can capture potential regional variations in creditworthiness. Some regions might have higher chances of defaults or approvals, which could be informative for predictions.

2026-01-30 12:59:37,671 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature generation using the provided operators. The aim is to create features that could potentially enhance predictive power in determining the success of credit card applications.

1. <Employed_DriversLicense_interaction><cross><Employed><DriversLicense><Interaction_between_employment_and_drivers_license_status_which_may_indicate_stability_and_mobility>
   - Reasoning: Having both a job and a driver's license may imply a higher level of stability and mobility, which could affect credit card eligibility positively.

2. <Income_log><log><Income><Logarithmic_transformation_of_income_to_normalize_income_distribution_and_handle_skewness>
   - Reasoning: Taking the logarithm of income can help reduce skewness in the income distribution, which often enhances model performance by stabilizing variance and normalizing the feature.

3. <YearsEmployed_Age_ratio><divide><YearsEmployed><CreditScore_encoded><Ratio_of_years_employed_to_credit_score_as_an_indicator_of_experience_relative_to_credit_trustworthiness>
   - Reasoning: This feature attempts to measure how years of employment compare to the credit score, serving as an indicator of whether a person’s years of work have rendered them a favorable credit score, which might highlight their financial reliability over their working history.

1. <Income_Employed_ratio><divide><Income><Employed><capturing_the_relationship_between_Income_and_Employed_status_to_reflect_financial_standing_relative_to_employment_status> 
   - This feature calculates the income-to-employment ratio to assess if employed individuals have significantly better financial standing compared to unemployed ones.

2. <PriorDefault_Married_Cross><cross><PriorDefault><Married><interaction_between_PriorDefault_and_Married_status_may_expose_new_relationship_based_on_their_joint_effect_on_credit_card_application_success> 
   - This interaction might reveal patterns where being married and having a history of default affects credit card application outcomes differently than other combinations.

3. <YearsEmployed_Log><log><YearsEmployed><applying_logarithmic_transformation_to_YearsEmployed_to_handle_non-linearity_and_variability_in_the_amount_of_employment_experience>
   - Applying a log transformation to years employed can mitigate skewness and explore non-linear relationships with success in credit card applications.

   - Reasoning: Encoding categorical features into numerical form can make them easily interpretable by the model and help capture the creditworthiness associated with specific industries.

2. \<Income_Binned\> <bin> <Income> <categorize_income_into_bins_to_capture_income_levels>  
   - Reasoning: Binning the Income feature can help the model capture the effect of different income levels on credit card application success while handling outliers and nonlinearities.

3. \<Employment_Status_Years\> <cross> <Employed> <YearsEmployed> <interaction_between_employment_status_and_years_employed_for_employment_stability_assessment>  
   - Reasoning: By interacting Employment status with Years Employed, we can capture the stability and duration of employment, which may be relevant for understanding financial stability and creditworthiness.

2026-01-30 13:00:14,221 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps that could improve the prediction of successful credit card applications:

1. <PriorDefault_BankCustomer_encoded><label_encode><PriorDefault_BankCustomer_interaction><converting_categorical_interaction_into_a_numerical_format_to_facilitate_model_input>

   Reasoning: The PriorDefault_BankCustomer_interaction feature is categorical. Converting it into a numerical format might help some machine learning models to better capture the interaction's effect on credit card application success.

2. <Employed_Married_interaction><cross><Employed><Married><interaction_between_Employment_and_Marital_status_to_identify_combinations_affecting_credit_application_success>

   Reasoning: Creating an interaction feature between Employed and Married can help uncover patterns or combinations of employment and marital status that might influence the likelihood of a successful application.

3. <Income_log><log><Income><log_transformation_of_Income_to_handle_skewness_and_better_represent_influence_of_income_on_credit_application_success>

   Reasoning: The Income feature is likely to be right-skewed due to some individuals earning significantly more. Applying a log transformation can help normalize this distribution, allowing models to better learn from and interpret the influence of income on the success of a credit card application.

2026-01-30 13:00:34,845 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the model's performance, feature engineering can be used to extract more useful information from the existing features. Below are three potential next steps for generating new features using the provided operators, with explanations:

1. Interaction between Employment Status and Years Employed:
   - Reasoning: The interaction between being employed and the number of years employed may capture the stability and experience of the applicant, potentially influencing credit card approval.
   - <Employment_YearsInteraction><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><capturing_combined_effect_of_employment_status_and_years_employed_on_creditworthiness>

2. Normalize Income feature to capture relative income levels:
   - Reasoning: Using z-score normalization on the Income feature can help adjust for outliers and provide a relative comparison of income across applicants, which may be crucial in determining their financial standing.
   - <NormalizedIncome><zscore><Income><adjusting_income_values_for_outliers_to_facilitate_comparisons_across_applicants>

3. Creditworthiness related to Industry:
   - Reasoning: Label encoding the categorical feature that describes the credit score in relation to the industry can create a numerical representation that captures industry-specific creditworthiness dynamics.
   - <CreditIndustry_encoded><label_encode><CreditIndustry><converting_industry_based_creditworthiness_to_a_numerical_format_for_model_use>

   Reasoning: The distribution of YearsEmployed exhibits higher skewness, thus applying the square root transformation may mitigate skewness and stabilize variance, facilitating better prediction accuracy.

2. <Income_Log_scaled><log><Income><apply_log_transformation_on_Income_to_reduce_range_and_influence_of_outliers>

   Reasoning: The Income feature has an extensive range and significant outlier presence. By applying logarithmic transformation, we can reduce the influence of extreme values and redistribute the feature into a more manageable range.

3. <Employed_Married_interaction><cross><Employed><Married><capture_interaction_between_employment_and_marital_status_indicating_potential_joint_effect_on_credit_card_approval>

   Reasoning: Interactions between Employed and Married may reveal dependencies related to financial stability and likelihood of approval. They might jointly influence the success rate depending on the socio-economic context, making it a potentially insightful feature.

   Reasoning: Creating a ratio between credit score and driver's license ownership might highlight significant differences in creditworthiness between individuals who possess a license and those who do not. This could be indicative of responsible behavior correlating with credit card application success.

2. <Income_BankCustomer_interaction><cross><Income><BankCustomer><cross_interaction_of_income_and_bank_account_status>
   
   Reasoning: Cross interaction between Income and BankCustomer may reveal complex relationships between these features, indicating whether having a bank account while earning more income improves credit card application success potential.

3. <PriorDefault_Employed_interaction><cross><PriorDefault><Employed><examining_relationship_between_prior_default_history_and_current_employment_status>
   
   Reasoning: By interacting PriorDefault with Employed status, we can analyze how the combination of previous default history and current employment status impacts credit card application success. It could help in assessing risks associated with lending to employed individuals with default history.
