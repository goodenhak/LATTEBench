3. \<normalized_credit_amount\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<credit_per_month\>\<Normalized credit amount by monthly payment to understand long-term credit impact\>

### Reasoning:

1. Encoding Categorical Features:
   - By label encoding checking_status, we convert it into a numerical feature checking_history_encoded. This can capture different levels of financial stability related to checking account status which might be beneficial for the model to understand nuanced differences in financial health.

2. Interactions between Categorical Features:
   - Creating an interaction feature savings_employment_interaction between savings_status and employment can help capture a composite financial stability profile. These two features are critical in assessing a person's financial reliability, and this interaction might capture unique insights into financial behavior that individual features might miss.

3. Normalization of Monetary Features:
   - The normalized_credit_amount feature is created by dividing credit_amount by credit_per_month. This gives an idea of the burden of the credit over its duration relative to monthly income and could provide the model with a clearer understanding of credit affordability. This normalization helps in comparing credit amounts across different durations.

1. <credit_amount_per_installment>divide<credit_amount><installment_commitment><Creditamountdividedbyinstallmentcommitmenttoinvestigatetheburdenofeachinstallment>

   Reasoning: This feature represents how much each installment costs in terms of the credit amount. A higher value might indicate a higher burden per installment, potentially impacting the likelihood of receiving credit.

2. <age_norm>zscore<age><Standardizedversionofagefornormalizationpurposestoimprovealgorithmperformance>

3. <credit_employment_ratio>divide<credit_amount><employment_encoded><Ratioofcreditamounttoemploymentencodetomeasurecreditlevelrelativeforemploymentstatus>

   Reasoning: This feature measures relative credit amount considering employment status, which might provide insights into credit worthiness levels adjusted by employment.

   Reasoning: Combining employment and savings status might uncover insights about financial stability. Individuals with longer employment history and higher savings might be less risky borrowers. 

2. \<credit_installment_ratio\><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment\><ratio_of_credit_to_installment_commitment\> 

   Reasoning: This feature gives insight into how the credit amount compares with the borrower's installment commitment, potentially indicating credit affordability.

3. \<age_duration_interaction\><multiply><age><duration\><interaction_between_age_and_credit_duration\> 

   Reasoning: The interaction between a borrower's age and the duration of their credit might highlight risk factors related to life stage and commitment length. Older borrowers with longer credit duration might behave differently than younger borrowers with short durations.

   - Reasoning: Combining checking and savings account status could reveal valuable information about an individual's financial health and liquidity, thus potentially improving the model's ability to predict credit approval.

2. \<employed_duration\>\<multiply\>\<employment_encoded\>\<duration\>\<employment_duration_interaction\>  
   - Reasoning: The interaction between employment category and duration might provide insights into the applicant's job stability and the intended duration of credit. This could differentiate between individuals who have consistent employment and those who have short-term jobs, which is useful for assessing credit risk.

3. \<credit_amount_to_income\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<installment_commitment\>\<credit_to_income_ratio\>  
   - Reasoning: Calculating the credit amount as a ratio of installment commitment (a proxy for disposable income) provides a measure of credit burden relative to income, which is an important consideration in assessing an individual's ability to repay the credit.

Reasoning:

1. installment_ratio: This feature is proposed to normalize the credit amount by the installment commitment. The ratio will account for how the credit amount relates to the customer's financial commitment per installment. Lower ratios might indicate a healthier financial status, which could improve the predictive performance of the model.
  
2. savings_credit_ratio: By taking the ratio of credit amount to savings status (assuming a numerical encoding of the savings status categories), we can gauge the balance between a person's credit amount and their savings. This can provide insights into financial stability and risk assessment, particularly if someone has high credit relative to their savings.
  
3. employment_duration_sum: The rationale behind combining employment duration (encoded) with the duration of credit is to capture the relationship between job stability and credit length. People who have been employed longer and have a sensible credit duration might be perceived as more stable and trustworthy borrowers, which could enhance predictive capability for determining credit approval.

2026-01-30 12:27:53,466 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps for generating new features to potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<checking_savings_status\><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Cross_product_of_checking_and_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: By creating a feature that represents the combined status of the checking and savings accounts, the model can capture any interaction effect between these two important financial indicators that might influence credit approvals.

2. \<credit_to_income_ratio\><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Credit_amount_as_a_ratio_of_installment_commitment>
   - Reasoning: This feature compares the credit amount to the installment commitment percentage, potentially capturing how much of an individual's available income is required to fulfill their credit obligation. It may identify individuals taking on credit commitments beyond their means.

3. \<employment_credit_history_interaction\><cross><employment_encoded><credit_history><Interaction_between_employment_and_credit_history>
   - Reasoning: By crossing employment status with credit history, this feature could highlight relationships between an individual's employment stability and their historical credit behavior, providing insight into their financial reliability.

   *Reasoning*: Financial stability often depends on both checking and savings accounts, so combining these may reveal insights about an applicant’s overall financial behavior.

2. \<credit_installment_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<installment_commitment\>\<Ratio of total credit amount to installment commitment, indicating payment affordability\>
   
   *Reasoning*: This ratio gives an idea of how the credit amount relates to monthly installment payments. A lower ratio indicates that the credit amount is more affordable given the borrower's installment commitments.

3. \<age_duration_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<age\>\<duration\>\<Captures the interaction between the applicant's age and the credit duration, potentially indicating life stage and commitment level\>
   
   *Reasoning*: Different age groups may have varying preferences or requirements for loan durations. This interaction can help discern patterns in credit duration preferences among different age groups.

   - Encoding categorical features like credit_history into numerical values can help improve the model's performance by allowing it to learn patterns and relationships that are difficult to discern with categorical data alone.

2. <credit_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment>

   - Creating a ratio of credit_amount to installment_commitment can help the model understand the balance between the amount of credit being requested and the monthly installment payments, which could indicate the borrower's financial burden or capacity to service the debt.

3. <checking_status_cross_savings_status><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Combined_checking_and_savings_account_status>

   - Cross product features like checking_status_cross_savings_status combine information from two categorical features, potentially capturing interactions that are significant for predicting whether a person receives credit. For instance, the combination of checking and savings account statuses might provide insights into the financial stability of the applicant.

   - Reasoning: The credit amount divided by the installment commitment can provide an indication of how affordable the credit is compared to the borrower's financial commitment. A lower ratio suggests that the borrower is less burdened by the credit, which may influence the likelihood of receiving a credit.

2. <employment_savings_cross><cross><employment><savings_status><Combination_of_employment_and_savings_status_to_assess_financial_stability>  
   - Reasoning: Combining employment status with savings account status may provide insight into the applicant's financial stability. For instance, an individual with long-term employment and substantial savings might be a lower credit risk.

3. <credit_duration_score><multiply><credit_per_month><duration><Composite_score_for_credit_duration_and_monthly_payment>  
   - Reasoning: By multiplying the monthly credit amount by the credit duration, we create a feature that captures the total commitment magnitude over time. This may highlight the long-term financial impact on the applicant and help model long-term risk assessment.

3. <age_zscore><zscore><age><Normalized_age_for_outlier_detection>

Explanation:
1. credit_amount_per_income: The ratio of credit amount to disposable income can give insights into the burden the credit might impose on the applicant. A higher ratio may indicate greater risk in terms of repayment ability, potentially affecting credit approval probabilities.

2. checking_status_savings_status_cross: Interaction between checking account status and savings status can provide additional context about the financial stability of the applicant. For example, someone with '>=200' in checking and '<1000' in savings might be considered less risky than someone with '<0' in checking and 'no known savings'.

3. age_zscore: Normalizing age through z-score can help the model focus on significant deviations from the mean age, which might correspond to certain creditworthy behaviors or risks. It can aid in identifying outlier ages that might affect credit decision-making.

   Reasoning: High monthly credit amounts over long durations could indicate a higher risk. By creating a feature that combines these, we might better capture the magnitude of the commitment relative to the borrower's ability to pay over time.

2. \<age_employment_stability\> \<plus\> \<age\> \<employment_encoded\> \<Combined indicator of stability considering both age and employment duration\>

   Reasoning: Older individuals with longer employment history could imply more stability and reliability. Combining age and employment can provide insight into a person's financial maturity and job stability, potentially improving predictions related to creditworthiness.

3. \<checking_savings_comb\> \<cross\> \<checking_status\> \<savings_status\> \<Interaction of checking account status and savings account status\>

   Reasoning: The combination of checking and savings account statuses can provide additional insights into a person's financial health. Understanding how these categorical features interact might reveal patterns of financial behavior indicative of credit risk.

2026-01-30 12:28:56,496 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_duration_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<duration\>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration\>  
   - Reasoning: This feature normalizes the credit amount by the duration, similar to credit_per_month. It provides insight into how the requested credit amount relates to the term of the credit, which might be a significant factor in risk assessment.

2. \<employment_credit_history_cross\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<credit_history\>\<Crossed_feature_of_employment_and_credit_history\>
   - Reasoning: Crossing these features can capture complex interactions between a person's employment history and their credit history. A stable employment alongside a positive credit history could indicate a higher likelihood of receiving credit.

3. \<savings_credit_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<savings_status\>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_status\>  
   - Reasoning: This intended to show the ratio of their desired credit amount to their savings status, giving an indication of how much of their existing savings they are leveraging for the credit, potentially indicating risk. Note that this would require savings status to be encoded numerically first.

2026-01-30 12:29:01,107 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<employment_savings_combination\>cross\<employment\>\<savings_status\>\<interaction_between_employment_and_savings\>: Creating an interaction feature between employment status and savings status can capture unique combinations that might be predictive of credit approval. This is important as these two factors together can reveal a person's financial stability and capability to repay the credit.

2. \<scaled_credit_amount\>minmax\<credit_amount\>\<scaled_credit_amount_between_0_and_1\>: Min-max scaling the credit amount normalizes this feature, allowing the model to compare credit requests on a similar scale. This can be crucial in ensuring that the model isn't unduly influenced by extreme credit amounts when making predictions.

3. \<age_employment_diff\>subtract\<age\>\<employment_encoded\>\<age_minus_employment_years\>: Subtracting the employment years from age gives an estimate of the age at which the person started their current employment. This can be insightful as people who have been employed for more years may be more financially stable and reliable borrowers.

2026-01-30 12:29:16,519 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating useful engineered features can improve the prediction performance by capturing non-linear relationships, interaction effects, or aggregating information in a meaningful way. Here are three possible feature engineering steps:

1. \<credit_age_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<age\>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_age\>  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between the amount of credit requested and the individual's age. Younger individuals requesting high credit amounts might be riskier, as they may not have established financial stability.

2. \<employment_stability\>\<plus\>\<employment_encoded\>\<residence_since\>\<Aggregate_of_long-term_stability_indicators\>  
   Reasoning: Summing employment duration with residence duration gives an indicator of stability. More stable individuals (long employment and residence) might be considered lower risk for credit.

3. \<credit_load_per_resident\>\<divide\>\<credit_per_month\>\<residence_since\>\<Monthly_credit_load_per_year_of_residence\>  
   Reasoning: This feature reflects how much monthly credit payment burden exists in relation to the time an individual has lived in one place. This could indicate financial stability or instability, depending on the balance between credit per month and years at current residence.

These features are designed to encapsulate meaningful relationships and interactions that are not immediately apparent from the individual raw features and serve to enhance the model's ability to discriminate between high and low credit risk borrowers.

3. <property_and_housing_cross><cross><property_magnitude><housing><Cross_join_of_property_magnitude_and_housing>

Reasoning:

1. Credit Amount to Duration Ratio: The ratio of credit amount to duration provides a normalized measure of credit burden over time. A high ratio might indicate a high monthly financial commitment, which could affect creditworthiness.

2. Employment and Savings Cross Feature: Combining employment status with savings status may reveal financial stability patterns. For example, having stable employment and significant savings might indicate a lower risk of default.

3. Property and Housing Cross Feature: By crossing property magnitude with housing status, we could capture insights into asset ownership and stability of living conditions, which are important factors in credit risk assessment.

   - Reasoning: Normalizing the employment category can highlight how stable a person's employment is relative to others. More stable employment often correlates with credit approval.

2. <age_credit_ratio>divide<age><existing_credits><Ratio of age to number of existing credits>  
   - Reasoning: This feature might capture how responsibly an individual accumulates credit relative to their age. A more moderated credit accumulation could indicate lower risk.

3. <contact_persistence>cross<own_telephone><foreign_worker><Combining telephone ownership and foreign worker status representing potential contact persistence and risk factor>  
   - Reasoning: Both having a telephone and not being a foreign worker might indicate stability and reliability. This cross feature can capture additional risk factors influencing credit decisions.

   - Reasoning: Creating a cross-feature between 'checking_status' and 'employment' can reveal interactions in these categories that impact creditworthiness, which might not be observable when these features are used independently.

2. <age_credit_amount_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><age><credit_amount_normalized_by_age>
   - Reasoning: By calculating the credit amount relative to age, this feature provides insight into whether the individual's credit amount is disproportionately high or low for their age, which could reflect financial stability or risk.

3. <residence_since_duration_interaction><multiply><residence_since><duration><interaction_between_residence_stability_and_loan_duration>
   - Reasoning: The product of 'residence_since' and 'duration' may capture the interaction between the stability of a person’s living situation and the term of the requested credit, which could be a significant factor in assessing risk.

   - Reasoning: This feature captures the joint effect of employment duration and savings status on creditworthiness. Combining these two could capture unique patterns in financial stability.

2. \<normalized_credit_amount\>divide\<credit_amount\>\<age\>\<Credit_amount_normalized_by_age\>  
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the credit amount by age helps in understanding the burden of the credit relative to the applicant's age, which could be important for assessing risk.

3. \<risk_profile\>concat\<checking_status\>\<credit_history\>\<Combined_risk_profile_based_on_checking_status_and_credit_history\>  
   - Reasoning: Combining checking account status with credit history might provide a comprehensive risk profile as applicants with good credit history but poor account status (or vice versa) may represent unique risk categories.

   - Reasoning: This feature provides information on how quick the credit amount is meant to be paid off relative to its duration. This could help in distinguishing between high- and low-risk credit behavior.
   
2. \<log_credit_amount\><log><credit_amount><LogTransformedCreditAmount>
   - Reasoning: Applying a log transformation to the credit amount helps in normalizing its distribution, especially when the data potentially exhibits a right-skewed pattern. This can help improve model performance by reducing the impact of outliers.

3. \<empl_save_cross\><cross><employment><savings_status><InteractionBetweenEmploymentAndSavings>
   - Reasoning: The cross product of employment and savings status can reveal patterns regarding financial stability and reliability, which may be crucial for predicting credit risk. This interaction captures the joint effect of employment and savings status on credit decision-making.

2026-01-30 12:30:10,509 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, each aiming to improve the model's performance in predicting credit approval outcomes:

1. Interaction Features with Economic Status:
   - Economic status indicators like checking_status, savings_status, and employment might jointly impact credit risk more significantly than individually. By using the cross operator, we capture complex relationships that might provide better insights.

   python
   <economic_status_cross><cross><checking_status><savings_status><cross_interaction_of_checking_and_savings_status>
   

2. Risk Assessment with Credit Characteristics:
   - Credit history and the number of existing credits might jointly inform an applicant’s creditworthiness. A combination could indicate a pattern of financial responsibility.

   python
   <credit_risk_interaction><cross><credit_history><existing_credits><interaction_between_credit_history_and_existing_credits>
   

3. Normalized Home Ownership with Credit Amount:
   - Housing status and the credit amount jointly might reveal insights into an applicant's financial stability and borrowing needs. Creating a ratio can help us understand the proportionality of credit demand relative to housing type.

   python
   <credit_to_housing_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><housing><ratio_of_credit_amount_to_housing_status>
   

These transformations introduce new perspectives on the data, enabling non-linear relationships to be captured, which may improve model prediction accuracy.

   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio of loan duration to credit amount could help identify individuals who might be overextending themselves with a high requested loan amount relative to the duration. A higher ratio might indicate a higher risk.

2. \<credit_age_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<credit_amount\> \<age\> \<Interaction_between_credit_amount_and_age\>  
   - Reasoning: The interaction between credit amount and age can give insight into creditworthiness. Younger individuals with high credit amounts might be riskier; older individuals might have more stable repayment behaviors. This interaction term might capture such dynamics.

3. \<checking_savings_combination\> \<cross\> \<checking_status\> \<savings_status\> \<Combination_of_checking_and_savings_status\>  
   - Reasoning: Combining checking account status with savings account status can uncover broader financial stability that either feature alone might not capture, providing a more complete picture of the individual's financial health.

3. <age_employment_score><plus><age><employment_encoded><Combined_score_of_age_and_employment_experience>  
   Reasoning: This feature merges information about age and employment stability. Older individuals with longer employment might be more stable and reliable, thus more likely to be granted credit.

2026-01-30 12:30:29,503 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here's a potential approach to feature generation to improve the model's performance:

1. <credit_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment>
   - Reasoning: This feature helps understand how much credit is being requested in relation to the individual's disposable income being committed to installments. A high ratio might indicate higher financial risk.

2. <employment_history_stability><subtract><residence_since><employment_encoded><Stability_in_employment_history>
   - Reasoning: The difference between residence and employment duration might indicate how stable or transient an individual's employment and living conditions are. This can be an indirect indicator of reliability or financial stability.

3. <age_credit_responsibility_index><multiply><age><existing_credits><Index_of_age_to_existing_credit_count>
   - Reasoning: This feature could help in understanding the responsibility level of the individual by comparing their age to the number of credits they have. Younger individuals with several credits may pose a higher risk.

2026-01-30 12:30:43,631 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<duration_squared\>\<square\>\<duration\>\<Square_of_duration_for_non_linear_relationships_identification\>  
   - Reasoning: Squaring the duration could help capture any non-linear relationships between the duration of the credit and the likelihood of credit approval. 

2. \<savings_job_cross\>\<cross\>\<savings_status\>\<job\>\<Interaction_between_savings_status_and_job_to_identify_combined_effect_on_credit_approval\>  
   - Reasoning: Cross-interacting savings status and job can provide insights into how the combination of these features affects credit approval, capturing more complex patterns that might exist between financial stability and type of employment.

3. \<age_zscore\>\<zscore\>\<age\>\<Standardized_age_to_normalize_the_effect_of_age_across_the_dataset\>  
   - Reasoning: Applying z-score normalization to age can help control for age-related bias, allowing the model to better generalize across different age groups and potentially improve model performance by standardizing the feature across the dataset.
