2026-01-30 12:53:22,652 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible steps to generate new features using the provided operators, with the goal of improving the downstream model's performance in predicting successful credit card applications:

1. <Age_Debt_Ratio><divide><Age><Debt><Age_to_Debt_Ratio>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the ratio between Age and Debt may provide insights into individuals who have managed their financial commitments better over time relative to their age, which could be a useful indicator for creditworthiness.

2. <Employment_Stability_Score><multiply><YearsEmployed><Employed><Combined_Employment_Stability_Score>
   - Reasoning: Creating a feature that combines YearsEmployed and Employed status could capture the stability of an individual's employment history, as both years employed and current employment status are important factors in creditworthiness assessments.

3. <Income_CreditScore_Product><multiply><Income><CreditScore><Income_and_CreditScore_Product>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures both the reported income level and the credit score in a single metric. A higher value may indicate individuals with better financial standing and credit history, which can be a meaningful predictor of credit card application success.

Reasoning:

1. IncomeDebtRatio: This feature captures the ratio of income to debt, providing insight into financial stability and ability to handle debt— a crucial factor banks consider when approving credit card applications. A higher ratio may indicate better debt management potential, which is often associated with credit approval.

2. CreditScoreYearsEmployedInteraction: By combining credit score with years worked at a job, this feature highlights the interaction between creditworthiness and employment stability. This interaction could capture nuances in risk assessment, as individuals with high credit scores and long job tenure may be deemed more reliable.

3. MarriedEmployedInteraction: This cross feature combines marital and employment status, which could affect creditworthiness. For instance, being married and employed might suggest a dual-income household with potentially more financial resources and stability, thus improving credit card application success rates.

2026-01-30 12:53:55,561 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible steps to generate new features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<PriorDefaultCreditScoreInteraction\> \<multiply\> \<PriorDefault\> \<CreditScore\> \<Interaction_between_Prior_Default_and_Credit_Score\>  
   - Reasoning: Combining PriorDefault and CreditScore can capture the effect of prior defaults on the credit score. This interaction can be important because having prior defaults could impact the credit score, affecting credit card application success.

2. \<IncomeEmployedRatio\> \<divide\> \<Income\> \<Employed\> \<Ratio_of_Income_to_Employment_Status\>  
   - Reasoning: The relationship between employment status and income level may play a key role in determining creditworthiness. By looking at the ratio, the model can gauge how much income is being generated by employed individuals, which could be a significant determinant.

3. \<IndustryEthnicityCross\> \<cross\> \<Industry\> \<Ethnicity\> \<Cross_Feature_of_Industry_and_Ethnicity\>  
   - Reasoning: Different industries might have different levels of financial stability, which could, in turn, be influenced by ethnicity. This cross feature can capture heterogeneity in application success that is attributed to the industry-ethnicity interaction.

   Reasoning: The PriorDefault feature has distinct values of 0 and 1, but we suspect that due to its mean and standard deviation, there could be noise. The square root transformation helps in reducing skewness and might capture some non-linear relations that are beneficial for prediction.

2. <income_bin><bin><Income><Binned_income_into_categories>

   Reasoning: The Income feature has a wide range with a significant standard deviation, indicating high variance. Binning income into categories might help in stabilizing variance and making the model more robust by simplifying the feature into a discrete set of categories, which is often beneficial when dealing with skewed income data.

3. <industry_credit_score_interaction><cross><Industry><CreditScore><Interaction_between_industry_and_credit_score>

   Reasoning: Different industries may have varying average credit scores, and their interaction can potentially reveal trends in credit score distribution across sectors. Creating this interaction feature helps capture the effect of industry-related credit tendencies on credit card application success.

2026-01-30 12:54:30,416 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features with explanations:

1. \<CreditRiskScore\>\<ratio\>\<CreditScore\>\<Debt\>\<CreditRiskScore_CreditScoreOverDebt\>  
   - Reasoning: This feature calculates the ratio of CreditScore to Debt, which can provide insights into how well the individual's credit score corresponds to their level of debt. A higher ratio might indicate better financial stability relative to their debt, which could be predictive of successful credit card applications.

2. \<Industry_EmploymentStatus\>\<cross\>\<Industry\>\<Employed\>\<Crossed_IndustryAndEmploymentStatus\>
   - Reasoning: By crossing the Industry with Employment Status, we can capture the interaction between these two factors. Certain industries might have more stable employment, and the employment status within these industries might reveal patterns that are indicative of credit card application success.

3. \<IncomeZScore\>\<zscore\>\<Income\>\<IncomeZScore_NormalizedIncome\>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the Income feature using Z-score transformation can help in identifying outliers and creating a scaled version of income for better comparability across individuals. A normalized income might better correlate with the probability of credit card application success, especially when combined with other demographic or financial variables.

   Reasoning: Combining these two features can help capture interactions where applicants with a prior default and low credit scores might be less likely to succeed. Multiplying may highlight those scenarios to improve model differentiation.

2. <Income_Bin><bin><Income><Income_binned_into_categories_for_better_categorization_effects_on_prediction>
   
   Reasoning: Binning Income into categories helps capture the non-linear effects of income on credit card application success. This can improve how the model understands different income segments.

2026-01-30 12:54:48,337 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating features to improve the downstream model's performance in predicting credit card application success:

1. <CreditScoreDebtInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><Debt><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_debt>
   - Reasoning: Creating an interaction term between CreditScore and Debt can capture situations where high debt levels may affect applicants with either high or low credit scores differently, helping to better separate successful from unsuccessful applicants.

2. <IncomeToDebtRatio><ratio><Income><Debt><Income_to_debt_ratio>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of income to debt provides an insight into financial stability and debt management capacity, which are typically significant factors in credit card application success.

3. <EmploymentStability><divide><YearsEmployed><Employed><Years_employed_adjusted_by_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: Adjusting YearsEmployed by employment status will give more importance to applicants who have consistent employment, as employment stability is often a key consideration in credit assessments.

   Reasoning: Creating a reciprocal of CreditDebtRatio could help distinguish applicants with low credit utilization more effectively, as higher values in certain features can sometimes obfuscate critical low-end differences.

2. \<IncomeCategories\>bin\<Income\>\<IncomeBinnedintoquartilestoreduceeffectofoutliersandprovidecategoryrepresentation\>  
   Reasoning: Binning Income into categories can help reduce the effect of extreme outliers and facilitate capturing patterns of success related to broader income groups.

3. \<IndustryEthnicityCross\>cross\<Industry\>\<Ethnicity\>\<CrossofIndustryandEthnicitytocaptureindustry-specificsuccesspatternsacrossethnicgroups\>  
   Reasoning: Crossing Industry with Ethnicity may expose hidden correlations or biases affecting credit card application outcomes, as success can vary significantly across different ethnic and industrial sectors.

2026-01-30 12:55:13,351 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the prediction model:

1. <CreditScoreEthnicityRatio><ratio><CreditScore><Ethnicity><Ratio_of_CreditScore_to_Ethnicity_as_a_numerical_label>
   - This feature captures the relationship between credit score and ethnicity, encoded as a numerical value. By analyzing the interplay between creditworthiness and diverse ethnic backgrounds, the model may identify ethnic groups with distinctive credit profiles, aiding in improved prediction accuracy.

2. <YearsEmployedIncomeInteraction><cross><YearsEmployed><Income><Interaction_between_YearsEmployed_and_Income>
   - Cross-categorizing the YearsEmployed and Income provides a feature that encompasses the potential correlation between length of employment and income levels. It can help improve prediction accuracy by capturing more nuanced relationships between stable employment and financial stability.

3. <DebtProfileIntensity><multiply><Debt><CreditDebtRatio><Debt_Intensity_Based_on_Credit_Utilization>
   - This feature assesses the intensity of debt relative to credit utilization. Multiplying the outstanding debt by the credit utilization ratio provides insight into the financial strategies different applicants might be using. It can help identify those efficiently managing their debt despite significant credit usage, contributing to their credit card application success.

   Reasoning: The ratio of income to debt is a critical financial metric in assessing creditworthiness. An individual with a higher income-to-debt ratio might be more likely to successfully apply for a credit card as they demonstrate more financial security.

2. <Employed_YearsEmployed_Cross><cross><Employed><YearsEmployed><Interaction_of_employment_status_and_years_employed>
   
   Reasoning: Combining the employment status with the number of years employed can highlight the stability and experience in employment. This interaction may help predict credit card approval by differentiating between stable and unstable job situations.

3. <CreditHistory_Factor><multiply><PriorDefault><CreditScore><Factor_incorporating_risk_and_creditworthiness>

   Reasoning: Multiplying PriorDefault by CreditScore can provide a compound view of credit history, highlighting both past defaults and current creditworthiness. This feature can offer insight into the applicant's historical credit behavior and their potential for risk, which is crucial for credit card approval.

2026-01-30 12:55:27,479 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Income_log><log><Income><Logarithm_transformation_of_Income_to_reduce_skewness>
   - Rationale: The Income feature has a large range and high standard deviation. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help reduce skewness and make this feature more normally distributed, possibly improving model performance.

2. <YearsEmployed_Category><bin><YearsEmployed><Categorize_YearsEmployed_into_bins_to_capture_non-linear_relationships>
   - Rationale: Given the spread of YearsEmployed, binning this numerical feature might capture non-linear relationships between years employed and credit card application success by separating into segments like newbie, experienced, and veteran. 

3. <CreditRiskScore><subtract><CreditScore><Debt><Calculate_the_effective_credit_risk_by_subtracting_debt_from_credit_score>
   - Rationale: Subtracting the Debt from CreditScore provides a new perspective on creditworthiness, focusing on the balance between credit potential and liability, which might predict success in credit card applications better than raw scores.

2026-01-30 12:55:31,030 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <CreditScore_Binned><bin><CreditScore><BinnedCreditScoreForCategoricalAnalysis>  
   Reasoning: Binning the CreditScore could help capture nonlinear relationships and make the feature more interpretable and useful for categorical analysis in combination with other features like Industry or Ethnicity.

2. <Income_Employed_Interaction><multiply><Income><Employed><CombinedEffectOfIncomeAndEmploymentStatusOnCardApplicationSuccess>  
   Reasoning: The interaction term between Income and Employed can capture the combined effect of these two factors on the prediction task, as earning an income while being employed might have a different impact than income from other sources (e.g., investments).

3. <CreditDebtRatio_ZScore><zscore><CreditDebtRatio><StandardizedCreditDebtRatioForBetterComparisonAcrossRecords>  
   Reasoning: Applying a z-score operation on the CreditDebtRatio will standardize this feature, making it more comparable across different records, and potentially highlighting individuals whose credit utilization is far from the average.

2026-01-30 12:55:46,020 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the model's performance:

1. <CreditScore_BankCustomer_Product><multiply><CreditScore><BankCustomer><Interaction_between_CreditScore_and_BankAccount_status>
   Reasoning: Multiplying credit score by bank customer status can capture the interaction effect between having a bank account and credit score. A higher score combined with being a bank customer might indicate better financial stability.

2. <Industry_Employed_Cross><cross><Industry><Employed><Cross_product_of_Industry_and_Employment_Status>
   Reasoning: Certain industries may have different employment stability or credit approval outcomes. Crossing industry with employment status could highlight patterns that affect credit card application success.

3. <Debt_to_Income_Ratio><divide><Debt><Income><Ratio_of_Debt_to_Income_as_a_financial_health_indicator>
   Reasoning: The debt-to-income ratio is a common metric to assess financial health. A lower ratio generally indicates better financial standing, which could be a significant predictor for credit card application success.

2026-01-30 12:55:56,165 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's explore three potential feature engineering steps to enhance the prediction of successful credit card applications:

1. Combining Industry and Credit Score:
   - <IndustryCreditInteraction><cross><Industry><CreditScore><Interaction_term_for_industry_and_credit_score>
   - Reasoning: Interactions between the industry and credit score could capture specific industry-related effects on creditworthiness. In some industries, even a moderate credit score might be deemed acceptable due to stable income patterns or other industry characteristics.

2. Enhanced Debt Profile:
   - <NormalizedDebt><zscore><Debt><Z-score_normalization_of_debt>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the debt feature using Z-score can account for large variability in debt values. This approach can make the model more sensitive to deviations from the mean, highlighting individuals whose debt levels are substantially above or below average.

3. Employment and Income Interaction:
   - <IncomeEmploymentRatio><divide><Income><YearsEmployed><Ratio_of_income_to_years_employed>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of income to years employed can help identify individuals who have managed to achieve a high income in a shorter duration, potentially reflecting higher earning potential or career growth, which can be indicative of financial stability.

By creating these new features, the model might better capture underlying patterns related to an individual's capability to manage a credit card.

3. \<IndustryDefaultRate\>groupbythenmean\<Industry\>\<PriorDefault\>Average_prior_default_rate_by_industry

### Explanation:

1. \<IncomeToDebtRatio\>ratio\<Income\>\<Debt\>Income_to_debt_ratio_as_financial_health_indicator
   - The Income to Debt Ratio helps assess an individual's financial health by comparing their income to outstanding debt. Traditional lenders often look at such ratios to understand potential risk, so accounting for this in the prediction model might help predict credit card application success.

2. \<AdjustedCreditScore\>multiply\<CreditScore\>\<Employed\>Credit_score_adjusted_by_employment_status
   - Adjusting the credit score by employment status considers that being employed might mitigate the risks associated with having lower credit scores. This can potentially help the prediction model differentiate better among individuals based on stable job situations.

3. \<IndustryDefaultRate\>groupbythenmean\<Industry\>\<PriorDefault\>Average_prior_default_rate_by_industry
   - Calculating the average prior default rate for each industry can help capture industry-specific risks of defaulting, which might be a useful predictor for credit card application success. Knowing how common defaults are in particular industries can lend context to other financial metrics.

2026-01-30 12:56:15,228 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps using the provided operations, with explanations:

1. Feature Suggestion 1:  
   - Reasoning: By creating a combination of Industry and Ethnicity, we aim to capture interactions between job sectors and cultural backgrounds, potentially revealing unique patterns in credit card application success.
    
   <IndustryEthnicityCross><cross><Industry><Ethnicity><Combination_of_industry_and_ethnicity>
   

2. Feature Suggestion 2:  
   - Reasoning: By applying a ratio of Debt to Income, we create a feature that can highlight financial stability or strain, which can be an important indicator when assessing credit card application success.
    
   <DebtIncomeRatio><divide><Debt><Income><Ratio_of_debt_to_income>
   

3. Feature Suggestion 3:  
   - Reasoning: By taking a logarithmic transformation of the CreditDebtRatio, we can mitigate the impact of extreme values and skewness, potentially leading to better model performance.
    
   <LogCreditDebtRatio><log><CreditDebtRatio><Logarithmic_transformation_of_credit_to_debt_ratio>
   

These engineered features are designed to capture deeper relationships and interactions in the data, potentially improving the model's ability to predict credit card application success.
