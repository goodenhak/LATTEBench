   Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between an applicant's savings and the credit amount they are requesting. A higher ratio may indicate a healthier financial situation relative to the credit request, potentially increasing the likelihood of receiving credit approval.

2. \<employment_duration_interaction\>\<cross\>employment_duration\<Interaction_of_employment_status_and_duration,_indicating_stability_of_income_source_over_loan_period\>
   
   Reasoning: Combining employment status with the duration of the credit can provide insights into the applicant's job stability over the credit period. Longer employment duration with a stable job may favor credit approval.

3. \<checking_status_savings_interaction\>\<cross\>checking_status_savings_status\<Interaction_of_checking_and_savings_status_to_capture_overall_financial_account_behaviors\>
   
   Reasoning: Interacting checking account status with savings status helps to understand the applicant's holistic view of their liquid asset management. This could further refine credit risk assessment by looking at both short-term and longer-term financial habits.

   - Reasoning: Combining checking_status and savings_status could provide a more comprehensive view of the financial stability of the applicant, potentially improving predictions by identifying patterns in creditworthiness based on the combination of these two financial status indicators.

2. <age_duration_ratio><divide><age><duration><ratio_of_age_to_loan_duration>
   - Reasoning: This feature could help interpret how the length of the loan aligns with the age of the applicant, potentially indicating maturity and risk assessment over time. Older applicants with long durations might be seen as less risky due to life stability, as opposed to younger applicants.

3. <credit_amount_per_existing_credit><divide><credit_amount><existing_credits><average_credit_amount_per_existing_credit>
   - Reasoning: This feature indicates the average credit amount per existing credit, providing insights into the applicant's existing credit behavior and exposure. High values may indicate high credit reliance or possible over-leverage, which could be predictive of default risk.

2026-01-30 12:11:55,454 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's generate some new features that could potentially improve the predictive performance of the model:

1. Feature: Calculate the ratio of credit amount by purpose mean to the duration.
   - Reasoning: This ratio can help capture the relative weight of the average credit amount a person is responsible for compared to the duration they have been paying it off. Higher values might indicate higher financial strain.
   - <credit_amount_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount_by_purpose_mean><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_by_purpose_to_duration>

2. Feature: Calculate the difference between age and age by job mean to understand deviation from peers.
   - Reasoning: This feature will help in understanding how different the applicant's age is compared to the average age in their occupation. A significant deviation might indicate risk factors or stability.
   - <age_difference><subtract><age><age_by_job_mean><Difference_between_age_and_average_age_for_job>

3. Feature: Categorize the residence duration into bins for stability insight.
   - Reasoning: Binning residence_since can help in transforming this numerical feature into categorical, capturing stability in residence which could be a proxy for general reliability or predictiveness in credit decisions.
   - <residence_duration_bins><bin><residence_since><Categorized_bins_of_residence_duration_for_stability_tracking>

   Reasoning: Combining checking and savings account statuses could provide an overall view of an individual's liquidity and financial risk levels, which might be a strong indicator of creditworthiness.

2. <employment_duration_score><cross><employment><duration><interaction_of_employment_and_duration_to_capture_stability_and_risk>
   
   Reasoning: The interaction between employment status and the duration of the credit could highlight stability in terms of income and the risk associated with longer durations for people with potentially less stable job histories. 

3. <age_credit_history_diff><diff><age><credit_history_length><difference_between_age_and_credit_history_length_to_gauge_experience_with_credit_relative_to_age>
   
   Reasoning: Calculating the difference between a person's age and their credit history length might indicate their maturity and experience with handling credit, which is a potential marker of responsibility in financial matters.

1. <duration_zscore><zscore><duration><Z-Score_scaled_duration_to_capture_normalized_duration_influence>: Applying Z-score normalization to the 'duration' feature helps to scale the data, making it easier for a model to interpret variations in duration relative to the mean and standard deviation. This transformation can improve model performance by ensuring that the 'duration' feature's influence is appropriately weighted relative to other features.

2. <credit_amount_by_purpose_ratio><ratio><credit_amount_by_purpose_mean><credit_per_installment_ratio><Ratio_of_credit_amount_by_purpose_mean_and_credit_per_installment_ratio_to_assess_relative_credit_stress>: Generating a ratio between 'credit_amount_by_purpose_mean' and 'credit_per_installment_ratio' can provide insights into how the average credit amount aligns with installment stress. This new feature can highlight individuals with higher or lower credit stress compared to the average purpose amount, which could be important for predicting credit decisions.

3. <employment_years_encoded><label_encode><employment><Encoded_employment_years_for_better_model_interpretation>: Encoding the categorical 'employment' feature into numerical values directly helps the model interpret variations in employment duration. This transformation allows for a more nuanced understanding of how employment stability impacts credit decisions and can potentially lead to improved prediction outcomes.

3. <checking_savings_combined_encoded><label_encode><checking_savings_combined><Numerically_encodes_combined_checking_and_savings_status_for_better_model_interpretation> 

Explanation:
1. Credit Stress Level: The ratio can help in understanding how the average credit amount for a purpose compares with the stress level indicated by the credit-per-installment ratio. This can provide valuable insights into the likelihood of credit stress, which is instrumental for predicting credit outcomes.

2. Duration Squared: Squaring the duration allows the model to capture non-linear effects of credit duration on the outcome. Longer durations could have a more complex relationship with credit approval than a simple linear effect.

3. Encoded Checking-Savings Combined Status: By encoding the checking-savings combined status into a numerical format, the model can interpret this categorical feature more effectively. This can improve the model's ability to capture the financial status of an individual, thus aiding in better prediction of creditworthiness.
