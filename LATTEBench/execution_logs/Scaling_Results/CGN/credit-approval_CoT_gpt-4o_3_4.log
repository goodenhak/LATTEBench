2026-01-30 13:06:27,130 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Income_to_Age<ratio<Income<Age<Ratio_of_income_to_age>
   
   Reasoning: The ratio of income relative to the applicant's age could indicate financial maturity or capability. Younger applicants with higher income compared to their peers might be more successful in obtaining credit cards.

2. <Debt_to_CreditScore<ratio<Debt<CreditScore<Ratio_of_debt_to_creditscore>
   
   Reasoning: This feature captures the balance between debt and credit score. Applicants with high debts yet still maintaining a good credit score might have a history of managing debts appropriately, which could correlate with successful credit card applications.

3. <Industry_Ethnicity_cross<cross<Industry<Ethnicity<Cross_of_industry_and_ethnicity>
   
   Reasoning: Different industries might offer varying opportunities or benefits across different ethnicities. By creating a cross-feature, we can capture potential interactions between industry sectors and ethnic backgrounds that could impact credit card application success.

2026-01-30 13:06:37,634 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that might improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Create an interaction feature between PriorDefault and CreditScore to capture the combined effect of prior defaults and credit score on credit card application success.
   - <PriorDefault_CreditScore_interaction><multiply><PriorDefault><CreditScore><interaction_between_prior_default_and_credit_score>

2. Use the cross operator to combine the Industry and Citizen features to capture any specific patterns between industry sectors and citizenship status that might influence credit card application success.
   - <Industry_Citizen_combination><cross><Industry><Citizen><interaction_between_industry_and_citizenship>

3. Calculate the ratio between YearsEmployed and Debt to create a financial stability metric that represents how effectively an individual manages their debt relative to their employment history.
   - <Employment_Debt_ratio><divide><YearsEmployed><Debt><ratio_of_years_employed_to_debt_management>

These features aim to capture interactions and relationships between different variables that might not be obvious when looking at the features individually. The first feature considers how credit history variables might interact, the second explores potential joint effects of demographic and occupational categories, and the third offers an economic indicator of financial health.

   - This feature can help in understanding how the debt level is influenced by prior defaults. People with high debt but no prior defaults may be viewed differently from those with both high debt and prior defaults.

2. <Employment_Stability><multiply><YearsEmployed><Employed><stability_of_employment>
   - Multiplying years employed by the employment status could act as a measure of employment stability, potentially capturing the effect of secure, long-term employment versus unstable or short-term obligations.

3. <CreditScore_Normalized><zscore><CreditScore><standardized_credit_score>
   - Standardizing the credit score will make its distribution mean zero and unit standard deviation, which can alleviate any potential skew in the feature and help the model focus on relative standing rather than absolute value.

2026-01-30 13:06:45,901 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations. The goal is to enhance the predictive power of the dataset for identifying successful credit card applications.

### Step 1: Create an Interaction Term between Employment and Prior Default
This feature aims to capture interaction effects between employment status and prior defaults. Being employed might mitigate the negative impact of a prior default on credit card application success.
plaintext
<Employed_PriorDefault_interaction><multiply><Employed><PriorDefault><interaction_between_employment_and_prior_default>


### Step 2: Transform Citizenship Categories into Encoded Numerical Values
By converting the citizenship statuses into numerical values, we enable the model to better capture the significance of different citizenship statuses in credit card application success.
plaintext
<Citizen_encoded><label_encode><Citizen>


### Step 3: Feature to Capture Employment Stability
By calculating a 'Stability Score,' which might highlight the employment situation relative to the total time, we can focus on how stability impacts credit card application success.
plaintext
<Employment_Stability><divide><YearsEmployed><Employment_Debt_ratio><stability_of_employment_relative_to_debt>


These steps are designed to bring out interactions, convert categorical data into a more model-friendly format, and highlight the impact of stability in employment, potentially improving the predictive capabilities of the model.

2026-01-30 13:07:41,199 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps to enhance the prediction model's performance for credit card application success.

1. <PriorDefault_YearsEmployed_interaction><multiply><PriorDefault><YearsEmployed><capture_interaction_of_prior_default_status_and_employment_duration>
   - Reasoning: Individuals with a history of defaults who have been employed for a longer duration might demonstrate financial stability over time. This feature could capture such dynamics and interactions that may impact credit card approval.

2. <Scaled_Employed_YearsEmployed_interaction><zscore><Employed_YearsEmployed_interaction><standardize_employed_years_employed_interaction_for_comparison>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing the Employed_YearsEmployed_interaction feature could help in assessing its weight relative to other features, ensuring that it aligns with the distributions of other numerical features and improving model convergence.

3. <Citizen_Industry_cross><cross><Citizen><Industry_Citizen_combination><combine_citizenship_and_industry_to_capture_joint_category_information>
   - Reasoning: Combining Citizen and Industry_Citizen_combination could uncover patterns unique to specific citizenship statuses within industries, potentially affecting the credit card application outcomes differently for diverse demographic groups.

2026-01-30 13:07:46,582 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <Debt_to_YearsEmployed_ratio><divide><Debt><YearsEmployed><Determine_ratio_of_outstanding_debt_to_years_employed_to_assess_repayment_capacity>
   - This feature creates a ratio between the outstanding debt and years employed, which can indicate an individual's ability to manage and repay debt. A lower ratio might signify better financial health and a higher likelihood of a successful credit card application.

2. <PriorDefault_DriversLicense_interaction><cross><PriorDefault><DriversLicense><Capture_effect_of_prior_default_and_drivers_license_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - This feature captures the interaction between having a prior default and possessing a driver's license. These two factors combined may reveal insights into an individual's reliability and ability to manage responsibilities, which can influence credit card approval.

3. <Employed_YearsEmployed_bucket><bin><Employed_YearsEmployed_interaction><Create_binned_categories_for_employment_duration_and_interaction_effects>
   - This feature bins the Employed_YearsEmployed_interaction into categories, which can help in capturing non-linear relationships and patterns that might be significant for predicting credit card application success. Binning can also help reduce noise and improve model interpretability.

These steps aim to provide a richer set of features that can capture subtle patterns and interactions in the data that may be relevant for predicting the success of credit card applications. Each feature is designed to highlight different aspects of financial behavior, employment stability, or personal reliability that are crucial for creditworthiness assessment.

2026-01-30 13:07:52,134 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for generating features using the specified operators:

1. <Employed_YearsEmployed_sqrt><sqrt><YearsEmployed><Take_the_square_root_of_YearsEmployed_to_smooth_out_large_differences_and_reduce_skewness_in_the_feature_distribution_for_better_model_performance>

   Reasoning: Taking the square root of the YearsEmployed can help reduce skewness in the variable, making it more normally distributed, which many machine learning algorithms prefer. This can potentially improve model performance by stabilizing variance.

2. <Debt_to_CreditScore_log><log><Debt_to_CreditScore_ratio><Apply_logarithm_to_the_Debt_to_CreditScore_ratio_to_reduce_impact_of_outliers_and_scale_values_for_better_model_performance>

   Reasoning: The Debt_to_CreditScore_ratio has a very wide range and could be impacted by extreme values (outliers). Applying the logarithm helps in reducing the range and impact of outliers by scaling the values, leading to a more stable model.

3. <Industry_Citizen_combination_encoded><label_encode><Industry_Citizen_combination><Convert_categorical_feature_Industry_Citizen_combination_to_numerical_for_more_effective_inclusion_in_models_that_do_not_handle_categorical_features_directly>

   Reasoning: Encoding the categorical feature Industry_Citizen_combination to numerical format can make it usable for algorithms that require numerical input. This transformation can provide the model with more information about different industry-citizen combinations.

2026-01-30 13:08:02,107 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Feature: Debt-to-YearsEmployed Ratio
   - This feature captures the relationship between an individual's debt and their employment duration, providing insight into how financial obligations relate to stability in employment.
    
   <Debt_YearsEmployed_ratio><divide><Debt><YearsEmployed><Ratio_of_debt_to_years_employed_for_financial_stability_analysis>
   

2. Feature: Interaction Between Prior Default and Banking Status
   - Individuals with a history of default and a bank account might have different behaviors and risk profiles compared to those without a bank account.
    
   <PriorDefault_BankCustomer_interaction><multiply><PriorDefault><BankCustomer><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_bank_customer_status>
   

3. Feature: Employment and Citizenship Interaction
   - Understanding the interaction between employment status/duration and citizenship status may highlight social factors affecting creditworthiness.
    
   <Employment_Citizen_interaction><concat><Citizen><YearsEmployed><Interaction_between_employment_duration_and_citizenship_status>
    

Each of these features aims to capture complex interactions and relationships that may not be evident with individual features alone. By using arithmetic and concatenation operators, we aim to model potential nonlinear relationships effectively.

Reasoning:
1. Debt_Per_YearEmployed: By calculating the ratio of debt to years employed, we can assess how debt levels relate to job stability and income duration. A higher ratio may indicate financial instability even with a stable employment history.

2. Industry_Citizen_Encoded: Encoding the Industry_Citizen_combination feature transforms this categorical feature into a numerical form. This can enhance its interpretability and use in a machine learning model, capturing the unique effects of industry and citizenship status interactions on credit card approval.

3. Debt_Employed_YearsEmployed_interaction: This feature captures the interaction effect between outstanding debt and the combined influence of employment years on credit score. It helps assess whether longer employment, despite debt levels, influences creditworthiness in application decisions.

2026-01-30 13:08:22,618 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could be implemented to improve the predictive performance of the model:

1. <Debt_YearsEmployed_ratio><ratio><Debt><YearsEmployed><Compute_ratio_of_Debt_to_YearsEmployed_to_capturing_how_a_person's_employment_duration_relates_to_their_outstanding_debt>

    Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between a person's years of employment and their debt. Applicants with a stable job over a long period might manage debt differently than those with a shorter employment history. A high debt relative to employment duration may indicate financial instability.

2. <CreditScore_normalized><zscore><Debt_CreditScore_interaction_ratio><Normalize_the_CreditScore_interaction_ratio_using_z-score_to_better_compare_across_applicants>

    Reasoning: Normalizing the interaction ratio can make it easier to compare applicants on a scale relative to the population mean and standard deviation, reducing the skew effects of extremely large values in the dataset.

3. <Employment_Citizenship_combination><cross><YearsEmployed><Citizen><Create_combined_feature_of_YearsEmployed_and_Citizenship_status_to_understand_the_impact_of_citizenship_on_employment_durations_and_credit_card_application_success>

    Reasoning: Combining YearsEmployed with Citizenship can uncover patterns related to employment stability and credit card application success for different citizenship statuses, as employment and legal status may affect financial behavior and creditworthiness.

Reasoning:

1. Debt_Income_Ratio: This feature helps to approximate the financial stability of an individual. A lower debt-to-income ratio typically indicates that an individual is in a stronger financial position, which may positively impact credit card application success.

2. Employed_Age_Interaction: By creating an interaction term between years of employment and citizenship status, we can capture how different combinations of employment duration and citizenship impact the likelihood of credit card approval. For example, employed citizens might be more successful in credit card applications compared to non-employed or non-citizens.

3. Industry_Citizen_Encoded: By encoding the categorical industry and citizenship combination into numerical values, we allow machine learning algorithms to make use of this complex interaction. This can help in understanding how the specific industry and citizenship status affect the probability of credit card approval.

   *Reasoning:* The distribution of YearsEmployed is skewed, as indicated by its mean (2.1505) being greater than the median (1.0) and a large standard deviation (3.2949). Applying the square root transformation can help normalize this distribution, potentially providing the model with more balanced information.

2026-01-30 13:08:50,563 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three suggestions for feature engineering that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<Employed_Debt_ratio\>\<divide\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Debt\>\<Ratio_of_years_employed_to_outstanding_debt\>  
   - Reasoning: This feature captures a financial stability indicator where consistent employment with a relatively low amount of debt indicates more stability, potentially increasing the chances of credit card application success.

2. \<PriorDefault_EmployedInteraction\>\<multiply\>\<PriorDefault\>\<Employed_YearsEmployed_interaction\>\<Interaction_of_prior_default_status_and_employment_duration\>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the impact of prior defaults with employment history, providing insight into how previous defaults might influence the creditworthiness of employed individuals.

3. \<Debt_Citizen_comb_interaction\>\<cross\>\<Debt\>\<Citizen_label_encoded\>\<Interaction_between_debt_and_citizenship_status\>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture how debt levels combined with citizenship status might influence credit card approval, acknowledging that citizenship status may impact the interpretation of financial metrics like debt.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between employment duration and the credit score impact due to prior defaults. Longer employment may offset the negative impact of prior defaults, influencing credit card approval likelihood.

2. \<Stability_ratio\> \<divide\> \<YearsEmployed\> \<Debt\> \<balance_between_employment_stability_and_debt_level\>  
   Reasoning: This feature indicates financial stability by comparing years of employment to outstanding debt. Individuals with stable employment and low debt are often more favorable credit card applicants.

3. \<Citizen_Industry_combined_label\> \<cross\> \<Citizen_label_encoded\> \<Industry_Citizen_combination\> \<combined_influence_of_citizenship_and_industry_on_credit_card_application\>  
   Reasoning: This interaction encapsulates the combined effect of citizenship and industry on credit card application success, which might capture unique patterns not evident when these features are considered separately.

Reasoning:

1. PriorDefault_byYearsEmployed: Dividing PriorDefault by YearsEmployed gives insight into how frequently defaults have occurred in relation to the applicant's employment duration. This could highlight individuals with concerning default patterns relative to their employment, which might affect credit card approval.

2. Employed_and_Married: This feature captures the combined effect of marriage and employment duration on credit card application success. Being married and having steady employment might be perceived positively by creditors, influencing approval rates.

3. Citizen_Industry: Creating an interaction between Citizen and Industry_Citizen_combination provides a more nuanced view of how citizenship status and industry type combine to influence credit card approval likelihood. This cross-feature could capture subtleties in financial behavior and stability associated with different industry and citizenship pairings.

2026-01-30 13:09:29,923 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps for generating new features to enhance the prediction of credit card application success:

1. \<Employment_Stability_Score\> \<multiply\> \<YearsEmployed\> \<BankCustomer\> \<Create_a_feature_that_combines_years_of_employment_and_bank_customer_status_to_assess_the_stability_of_applicants_income_and_financial_situation\>

   *Reasoning:* People who have been employed for a longer duration and have a bank account are likely to be seen as more financially stable and reliable by credit issuers. Multiplying these features could offer insights into an individual's financial stability, potentially improving the model's prediction accuracy.

2. \<Debt_Weighted_by_PriorDefault\> \<multiply\> \<Debt\> \<PriorDefault\> \<Assess_the_implication_of_outstanding_debt_with_prior_default_status_on_creditworthiness\>

   *Reasoning:* Individuals with a history of prior defaults could be penalized more for their debt levels when applying for a credit card, suggesting a combination of these features may allow the model to better understand credit risk related to past behaviors.

3. \<Industry_Citizen_Encoded\> \<label_encode\> \<Industry_Citizen_combination\> \<Transform_industry_and_citizenship_combination_into_a_numerical_feature_for_model_input\>

   *Reasoning:* The interaction between an individual's industry and their citizenship status could reflect economic stability and overall creditworthiness. By label encoding this categorical feature, the model can leverage this interaction more directly in numerical computations, potentially enhancing predictive performance.

2026-01-30 13:09:42,798 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! For improving the downstream model's performance on credit card application predictions, we'll focus on creating features that can provide more nuanced insights into an individual's attributes and behaviors.

1. Interaction of Employment Duration and Default Behavior  
   Rationale: Combining employment duration with the default behavior might reveal patterns where more stable employment correlates with different default patterns, influencing credit card success.
   plaintext
   <EmploymentYears_PriorDefault_interaction><multiply><YearsEmployed><PriorDefault><interaction_of_years_employed_with_prior_default_to_assess_credit_success>
   

2. Normalized Debt-to-Income Ratio  
   Rationale: Instead of directly using raw values, normalizing debt to income (assuming employment duration as a proxy for income) can help assess the burden more accurately, leading to better risk profiling.
   plaintext
   <Normalized_Debt_Employed_Interaction><divide><Debt><Employed_YearsEmployed_interaction><ratio_of_debt_to_employed_income_interaction>
   

3. Citizenship and Industry Interaction using Label Encoding  
   Rationale: By encoding the citizenship and industry combinations, we can provide numerical inputs that allow the model to learn complex patterns between these social attributes and credit success.
   plaintext
   <Industry_and_Citizen_encoded><label_encode><Industry_Citizen_combination><numerical_representation_of_citizenship_and_industry_combination>
   
These steps aim to provide the model with richer and more interpretable features, potentially capturing relationships that enhance its ability to make accurate predictions about credit card application success rates.

   *Reasoning*: Individuals with a history of defaults and longer employment tenure may still show financial stability. This feature may help differentiate applicants who have moved past their previous defaults due to stable employment.

2. <TotalCreditWorthiness><subtract><YearsEmployed><Debt><proxy_for_credit_worthiness_based_on_employment_duration_vs_debt_level>
   
   *Reasoning*: Higher employment duration relative to debt could indicate financial responsibility, which might be useful in assessing credit card application success.

3. <DebtToIncomeAndMaritalStatus_ratio><ratio><Debt><Married><evaluate_financial_stability_considering_marital_status_and_debt_level>
   
   *Reasoning*: Marital status can be a surrogate marker for dual income or increased financial obligations, and understanding its interaction with debt levels may provide insights into applicant stability.

2026-01-30 13:09:58,164 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. \<PriorDefault_YearsEmployed_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<PriorDefault\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<interaction_between_prior_default_and_years_employed\>  
   Reasoning: Combining prior default status with years employed can reveal individuals who have defaulted in the past and may face challenges in building stable employment, potentially affecting their credit application success.

2. \<Debt_to_Employed_YearsEmployed_ratio\>\<divide\>\<Debt\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<ratio_of_debt_to_employment_duration\>  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the proportion of outstanding debt relative to the years employed. High debt against short employment duration might indicate financial instability, thus affecting credit card approval chances.

3. \<Driver_BankCustomer_interaction\>\<cross\>\<DriversLicense\>\<BankCustomer\>\<capture_combination_of_driving_license_and_bank_account_status\>  
   Reasoning: Combining these two features may identify individuals with greater stability and financial access, as both owning a driver's license and having a bank account could indicate a lower credit risk.

   Reasoning: This feature leverages the geographical aspect of the dataset by aggregating employment duration over a ZipCode. It could reveal employment stability trends that are geographically influenced and might impact creditworthiness.

2. <DebtLog><log><Debt><log_transformed_debt_to_handle_skewness_in_debt_distribution>

   Reasoning: The log transformation on Debt aims to normalize its skewed distribution, particularly useful given that financial data like debt often follows a log-normal distribution. This transformation might help enhance modeling performance by mitigating skewness effects.

3. <Debt_to_YearsEmployed_Ratio><ratio><Debt><YearsEmployed><financial_liability_to_employment_duration_ratio_determining_if_high_debt_is_balanced_by_employment_stability>

   Reasoning: This feature calculates the ratio of outstanding debt to years employed, providing insights into whether an individual’s financial liability is balanced by their employment stability. A lower ratio might suggest a more stable financial condition relative to employment duration, potentially affecting credit card application success.

2026-01-30 13:10:11,279 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for generating new features using the given list of operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<Debt_Employed_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<Debt\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Interaction_of_outstanding_debt_and_years_employed_to_capture_stability_and_liability\>

   Reasoning: This feature combines debt and employment duration to assess how stable an individual's financial situation may be when seeking credit card approval. Longer employment might imply better financial stability, while higher debt indicates greater liability. 

2. \<ZipCode_Creditworthiness\> \<groupbythenmean\> \<ZipCode\> \<Debt_to_CreditScore_ratio\> \<Average_ratios_of_debt_to_credit_score_by_zip_code_to_identify_geographic_trends_in_credit_risk\>

    Reasoning: By grouping by ZipCode and taking the mean of the Debt_to_CreditScore_ratio, we can capture trends within certain geographic areas. This might reveal areas with better or worse credit behaviors, helpful in risk assessment.

3. \<Citizen_Industry_combination_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<Industry_Citizen_combination\>\<Numerical_encoding_of_industry_and_citizen_combination_for_analysis\>

   Reasoning: Encoding the combination of industry and citizenship as a numerical feature can be beneficial for algorithms that require numerical input. This allows the model to learn more complex patterns from industry and citizenship combinations.

   *Reasoning:* Employment stability and lower debt levels are often indicative of a lower risk profile for credit applications. By calculating the ratio of years employed to outstanding debt, we can create a feature that reflects individual financial stability.

2. <Normalized_YearsEmployed><minmax><YearsEmployed><Normalized_years_employed_for_uniform_scaling>
   
   *Reasoning:* Features scaled within a specific range can improve model performance by ensuring uniform feature distribution. Normalizing years employed may enhance the interpretability of this feature in relation to credit card application success.

3. <Debt_ByCitizenType_mean><groupbythenmean><Citizen><Debt><Mean_debt_grouped_by_citizen_type>
   
   *Reasoning:* Grouping debt by citizen type and calculating the mean will allow the model to capture patterns of different debt levels associated with various citizenship categories, potentially providing insights into borrowing behaviors based on citizenship status.

2026-01-30 13:10:29,093 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps to generate additional features for improving the prediction model:

1. <PriorDefault_YearsEmployed_interaction><multiply><PriorDefault><YearsEmployed><interaction_between_prior_default_and_years_employed>  
   Reasoning: This feature interacts the impact of having a prior default with the number of years employed. Longer employment might mitigate the negative impact of prior defaults, which can be instrumental in determining credit card application success.

2. <Debt_Employed_CreditScore_interaction><multiply><Debt><Employed_CreditScore_interaction><interaction_between_debt_and_combined_employment_credit_score>  
   Reasoning: Evaluating the financial behavior of applicants by interacting their current debt with the combined impact of employment status and credit score could provide further insight into their financial stability.

3. <Debt_to_Income_Ratio><divide><Debt><YearsEmployed><ratio_of_debt_to_years_employed_as_synthetic_income>  
   Reasoning: This feature serves as a proxy for the income level or capacity to handle debt based on how employment years relate to the amount of outstanding debt, which could be a critical aspect in assessing creditworthiness.
