### Reasoning:
1. Numerical encoding of categorical features (Ethnicity and Industry): Encoding categorical features into numerical values can help machine learning models better capture patterns, especially those which don't natively handle categorical inputs well. This can improve decision boundaries in models like logistic regression or decision trees and improve predictive accuracy.

2. Age to Income Ratio: The relationship between age and income can be insightful as a feature. It may indicate financial stability or career progression, impacting credit card application success. An individual with a high income relative to their age might be seen as more financially secure, potentially aiding approval predictions.

These transformations are designed to enhance the feature set by providing the model with additional insights that could differentiate successful credit card applications from unsuccessful ones.

   Reasoning: Applying the square root transformation to the CreditScore can help reduce the impact of very high scores and manage skewness, potentially improving prediction stability when used in models.

2. <EmployedIndustryCross><cross><Employed><Industry><Interaction_between_Employment_status_and_Industry_to_capture_sector_specific_employment_dynamics>

   Reasoning: The combination of employment status and industry might reveal patterns not captured by individual features, indicating sector-specific employment effects on credit card application success.

3. <Debt_to_Income_Sigmoid><sigmoid><Debt_to_Income_ratio><Transform_Debt_to_Income_ratio_to_condense_extreme_values_and_manage_spread>

   Reasoning: Applying a sigmoid transformation to the Debt_to_Income_ratio can compress extreme values into a manageable range, potentially improving the ability of models to differentiate between applicants with very differing financial stability.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between an individual's income-to-debt ratio and their outstanding debt. A lower adjusted debt ratio might indicate better financial health relative to their outstanding debt balance, potentially improving the prediction of credit card approval.

2. <Employment_Impact><multiply><Employment_ratio><Employed><Impact_of_employment_on_career_progress>

   Reasoning: Combining the employment status and the employment ratio can help assess how employment affects career progression. This feature can highlight individuals who are effectively using their employment years compared to their age, potentially increasing their creditworthiness.

3. <CreditScore_Industry_Interaction><cross><CreditScore_category><Industry><Interaction_of_credit_score_and_industry_to_assess_sector_specific_creditworthiness>

   Reasoning: Different industries may have varying levels of risk and stability, which can interact with an individual's credit score category. This interaction feature can help model the impact of industry-specific factors on credit card application success, capturing sector-specific risk profiles.

   Reasoning: Exponentially transforming the Debt_to_Income_ratio may reveal non-linear relationships with credit card application success, particularly useful for high debt-to-income ratios.

2. <Married_BankCustomer_interaction>multiply<Married><BankCustomer><Interaction_between_marital_status_and_bank_account_ownership_for_risk_assessment>
   
   Reasoning: Creating an interaction between 'Married' and 'BankCustomer' can help assess if marital status combined with bank account ownership influences credit card application success. Married individuals with bank accounts might have different risk profiles.

3. <Employed_Industry_cross>cross<Employed><Industry><Cross_categorization_of_employment_status_and_industry_for_more_precise_labor_market_analysis>
   
   Reasoning: Crossing 'Employed' with 'Industry' could provide insights into how specific job sectors influence the likelihood of credit card application success, considering employment status.

2026-01-30 13:03:32,674 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<PriorDefault_CreditScore_interaction\>multiply\<PriorDefault\>\<CreditScore\>\<Interaction_between_prior_default_and_credit_score_to_assess_credit_risk\>  
   Reasoning: Interaction features can capture non-linear relationships between attributes, and this might reveal how prior defaults combined with credit scores influence success rates.

2. \<AgeCategory\>bin\<Age\>\<Categorize_age_into_bins\>  
   Reasoning: Binning age into categories can allow the model to capture age-specific trends or behaviors related to credit card applications that might not be evident with a continuous variable.

3. \<Employment_stability\>divide\<YearsEmployed\>\<Employment_prior_default_interaction\>\<Assess_stability_of_employment_relative_to_default_risk\>  
   Reasoning: This feature could help quantify employment stability in the context of default risk, potentially differentiating applicants with varying employment lengths and default interactions.

<Employment_industry_interaction><cross><Employed><Industry><interaction_between_employment_status_and_industry_to_capture_employment_sector_effect>
 

Explanation:

1. Log Transformation on Debt to Income Ratio:
   - Feature: <Debt_to_Income_log>
   - Operator: <log>
   - Feature Used: <Debt_to_Income_ratio>
   - Description: <log_transformed_debt_to_income_for_better_handling_of_skewness>
   - Reasoning: Debt to income ratio is highly skewed as seen with its values ranging from 0 to 19,000,000. Applying a log transformation will help compress the scale, making it less skewed and potentially more predictive in downstream modeling due to a more normalized distribution.

2. Age and Credit Score Interaction:
   - Feature: <Age_credit_interaction>
   - Operator: <multiply>
   - Features Used: <Age><CreditScore>
   - Description: <interaction_between_age_and_credit_score_to_assess_risk_profile_based_on_maturity>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between Age and Credit Score can capture a nuanced risk profile where maturity (age) might moderate the effect of credit score on credit application success. Older applicants with moderate credit scores might exhibit different patterns than younger applicants with the same scores.

3. Employment and Industry Interaction:
   - Feature: <Employment_industry_interaction>
   - Operator: <cross>
   - Features Used: <Employed><Industry>
   - Description: <interaction_between_employment_status_and_industry_to_capture_employment_sector_effect>
   - Reasoning: Employment status often influences credit decisions differently across industries. This feature attempts to capture the unique credit risk profiles that emerge as a result of different industry dynamics and employment conditions, potentially improving model performance by accounting for these nuances.

2026-01-30 13:03:45,446 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps aimed at improving the downstream model's performance for predicting successful credit card applications:

1. Creating an interaction term between Debt and Employment_ratio to capture how debt levels impact individuals relative to their age and employment duration.
   - \<Debt_EmploymentRatio_interaction\>multiply\<Debt\>\<Employment_ratio\>\<Interaction_between_debt_and_employment_ratio_to_capture_age-adjusted_financial_risk\>

2. Normalizing YearsEmployed to better capture its impact by adjusting for age effects. This helps in examining how employment duration relative to age can indicate responsibility or stability, which is crucial for credit card approval.
   - \<Normalized_YearsEmployed\>divide\<YearsEmployed\>\<Age\>\<YearsEmployed_normalized_by_age_to_assess_responsibility\>

3. Utilizing CreditScore and PriorDefault to create a new variable that highlights creditworthiness. High credit scores and lack of defaults are strong indicators of financial reliability.
   - \<CreditScore_and_PriorDefault_factor\>multiply\<CreditScore\>\<negate\>subtract\<CreditScore_and_PriorDefault_factor\>\<PriorDefault\>\<Factor_combining_credit_score_and_inverted_prior_default_for_credit_worthiness\>

By these operations, we introduce features that aim to elucidate nuanced relationships between financial behavior, employment, and credit scores, potentially enhancing the predictive capability of the model in deciding credit card approval likelihoods.

2026-01-30 13:03:50,354 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's generate some new features to potentially improve the credit card application prediction model's performance:

1. <PriorDefault_CreditScore_interaction><multiply><PriorDefault><CreditScore><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_credit_score_to_assess_risk>  
   Reasoning: Combining the PriorDefault status with the CreditScore can provide insight into the risk level associated with defaults and help better understand the applicant's creditworthiness.

2. <AgeYearsEmployed_ratio><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><Ratio_of_years_employed_to_age_as_a_stability_indicator>  
   Reasoning: The relationship between an individual's age and the number of years employed can serve as a useful metric for assessing career progress and stability over time, which may correlate with the likelihood of successful credit card applications.

3. <Industry_PriorDefault_interaction><cross><Industry><PriorDefault><Assessing_how_prior_defaults_vary_across_industries>  
   Reasoning: Cross-referencing industry types with PriorDefault can illuminate patterns of default in various sectors, helping identify whether certain industries are more prone to defaults and can contribute to a more nuanced view of credit risk profiles.

These new features aim to provide deeper insights into applicant profiles, which could help the downstream model better predict credit card application outcomes.

   Reasoning: The distribution of the Debt_to_Income_ratio appears to be highly skewed, given its large range and high mean relative to its quartiles. Applying a log transformation can help reduce skewness and make the data more homogeneously distributed, potentially improving the model's ability to learn patterns related to financial stability.

2. <Employment_Status_Credit_Interaction><cross><Employed><CreditScore_category><Combine_employment_status_and_credit_score_to_assess_combined_impact_on_credit_application_success>

   Reasoning: Combining the employment status with the credit score category might reveal interactions between employability and creditworthiness, providing additional insight into a person's likelihood of credit card application success. It helps to capture nonlinear relationships that might not be apparent when features are used independently.

3. <CreditScore_Adjusted_by_Age><ratio><CreditScore><Age><Adjust_credit_score_for_age_to_examine_creditworthiness_relative_to_peers_in_the_same_age_group>

   Reasoning: By considering the ratio of the credit score to age, we can assess whether a person's credit score is high or low relative to their age. This may help in understanding an individual's creditworthiness with respect to their life stage and can be a powerful indicator of financial maturity and responsibility.

   Explanation: The Debt_to_Income_ratio has an extremely high range and mean, indicating skewness. Applying a log transformation can help in normalizing this distribution and making it more suitable for predictive modeling.

2. <CreditScore_Age_interaction><multiply><CreditScore><Age><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_age_to_assess_historical_credit_behavior>

   Explanation: By creating an interaction term between CreditScore and Age, we can evaluate how age might influence one's credit score. Younger individuals might have lower scores due to less credit history, whereas older individuals could have established records impacting approvals.

3. <Employment_Default_CreditScore_interaction><multiply><Employment_prior_default_interaction><CreditScore><Interaction_between_prior_default_with_employment_and_credit_score_to_assess_risk>

   Explanation: Combining Employment_prior_default_interaction with CreditScore can provide insights into individuals who have a previous default but a high credit score, indicating a rebound or exceptional recovery from past financial issues.

    - Reasoning: The Debt_to_Income_ratio has a positively skewed distribution that may impact model performance. Log transformation can help normalize the distribution, making it more suitable for linear models.

2. <Age_Bin><bin><Age><Binning_age_into_categories_to_capture_age_related_risk>
    - Reasoning: Age can have non-linear effects on credit card application success. Binning can help capture risk profiles associated with specific age ranges, making patterns easier to learn for the model.

3. <Industry_Employment_PriorDefault_Cross><cross><Industry><Employment_prior_default_interaction><Cross_interaction_to_capture_industry_specific_employment_and_default_profiles>
    - Reasoning: Industry contexts could affect how prior defaults and employment statuses impact credit card approval. Creating an interaction feature can help the model learn such industry-specific risk patterns more effectively.

2026-01-30 13:04:23,064 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, let's create three potential new features using the provided operators that could help improve predictive performance for determining which individuals are successful in applying for a credit card.

1. <EmploymentStability><multiply><Employment_ratio><YearsEmployed><Measure_of_employment_stability_by_combining_years_employed_with_employment_ratio>
   - Reasoning: By multiplying Employment_ratio by YearsEmployed, we can create a feature that represents overall employment stability—a high value could indicate a stable job history, which may correlate with credit approval success.

2. <CreditRiskFactor><multiply><Debt_to_Income_ratio><PriorDefault><Combined_credit_risk_assessment_considering_debt_to_income_and_prior_defaults>
   - Reasoning: This feature considers both debt-to-income ratio and history of prior defaults to create a comprehensive risk factor. Individuals with prior defaults and high debt-to-income ratios are typically seen as higher risk during credit assessments.

3. <CitizenshipEncoded><label_encode><Citizen><Numeric_encoding_of_citizenship_status_for_modeling>
   - Reasoning: Converting the categorical citizenship status into numerical values can improve the model's ability to capture this information's effect on credit card application success, as certain citizenship categories might correlate with application success rates.

   Reasoning: Binning the existing 'Debt' feature can help categorize individuals into different debt levels, giving a clearer indication of their financial burden and aiding the model in assessing creditworthiness.

2. <EmploymentIncomeStability<ratio<YearsEmployed<Age<Ratio_of_YearsEmployed_to_Age_to_assess_employment_stability_over_lifetime>
   Reasoning: The ratio between 'YearsEmployed' and 'Age' provides insight into the employment stability and career progression of individuals, which could be crucial in predicting successful credit card applications, considering reliability and income stability.

3. <CreditScoreImpact<cube<CreditScore<Cubed_Credit_Score_to_amplify_impact_in_assessing_risk>
   Reasoning: Transforming the 'CreditScore' using a cube operation increases the weight of high CreditScore values on the model. This emphasizes the effect of high credit scores on the likelihood of successful credit card applications, potentially distinguishing more creditworthy individuals.

   - Reasoning: By multiplying PriorDefault and Employment_ratio, we create a feature that captures the combined effect of having a prior default and the ratio of years employed to age. This may highlight individuals who had defaults but have been making progress in their careers, which can be indicative of improved credit behavior.

2. <Debt_to_Income_zscore><zscore><Debt_to_Income_ratio><Standardized_debt_to_income_ratio_for_comparative_analysis>
   - Reasoning: By standardizing the Debt_to_Income_ratio through z-score normalization, we can handle the wide range of this feature's values more effectively. This process may help the model more easily differentiate profiles with relatively high or low debt-to-income ratios.

3. <Industry_BankCustomer_cross><cross><Industry><BankCustomer><Interaction_between_industry_and_bank_customer_status>
   - Reasoning: The cross product of Industry and BankCustomer creates a feature that captures the interaction between a person's employment sector and whether they have a bank account. This interaction may reveal patterns in credit card application success rates that vary by industry and banking status, reflecting differing access to credit and financial habits across job sectors.

2026-01-30 13:04:44,105 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <Debt_to_Income_ratio_zscore><zscore><Debt_to_Income_ratio><Standardize_Debt_to_Income_ratio_to_improve_model_handling_of_outliers>
   - Reasoning: The Debt_to_Income_ratio has a very large range and high standard deviation, indicating the presence of outliers. Standardizing this feature might help the model handle these outliers better and improve its predictions.

2. <Industry_encoded><label_encode><Industry><Convert_categorical_Industry_feature_to_numeric_for_use_in_model>
   - Reasoning: Converting the Industry categorical feature into a numerical representation using label encoding can help models that inherently work better with numerical inputs.

3. <Age_to_YearsEmployed_ratio><ratio><Age><YearsEmployed><Create_a_ratio_of_Age_to_YearsEmployed_to_assess_experience_relative_to_age>

   * Reasoning: Applying a square root transformation to the CreditScore could help capture any non-linear relationships with credit risk while reducing skewness and making the distribution more normal-like.

2. \<Employment_Age_ratio\> \<divide\> \<YearsEmployed\> \<Age\> \<Ratio_of_YearsEmployed_to_Age\_to_identify_experience_level_relative_to_age\>
   * Reasoning: The new feature captures the proportion of an individual's life they have been employed, which might be a relevant predictor for assessing financial reliability.

3. \<Industry_encoded\> \<label_encode\> \<Industry\> \<Numerical_encoding_of_Industry_to_captur_information_while_combining_with_other_features\>
   * Reasoning: Converting the 'Industry' categorical variable into a numerical one enables us to use it in further mathematical transformations and interactions with other numerical features, potentially uncovering valuable predictive patterns related to industry type.

2026-01-30 13:05:07,496 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for generating new features to improve the prediction model's performance:

1. \<PriorDefault_Employed_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<PriorDefault\> \<Employed\> \<Interaction of prior default and employment status to assess credit risk\>

   Explanation: Creating an interaction term between PriorDefault and Employed helps to understand the interplay between a person's past financial behavior (default) and their current employment status. Someone who has a previous default but is currently employed might represent a different profile compared to someone who is unemployed, even if they have the same default history.

2. \<Income_proxy\> \<divide\> \<Debt\> \<Debt_to_Income_ratio\> \<Estimate of income based on debt and debt to income ratio\>

   Explanation: In the absence of the actual income data, we can approximate an Income proxy by dividing the Debt by the Debt_to_Income_ratio. This provides a useful feature to understand the financial capacity and stability of the individual, which might affect the credit card approval.

3. \<Employment_ratio_category\> \<bin\> \<Employment_ratio\> \<Categorize employment ratio to assess career progression\>

   Explanation: Binning the Employment_ratio will categorize individuals into various career stages based on their ratio of years employed to age, such as early-career, mid-career, etc. This could be a useful feature when evaluating the stability and predictability of income, which could influence credit card application success.

2026-01-30 13:05:18,607 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<PriorDefault_Employment_ratio_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<PriorDefault\> \<Employment_ratio\> \<Interaction_between_prior_default_and_employment_ratio_to_assess_credit_risk\>

   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between having a prior default and the employment ratio. If someone has defaulted previously but has been steadily employed relative to their age, this could provide nuanced insight into their current credit risk profile.

2. \<Normalized_Debt_to_Income_ratio\> \<zscore\> \<Debt_to_Income_ratio\> \<Z-scored_debt_to_income_ratio_to_standardize_value_distribution\>

   Reasoning: The original debt-to-income ratio has a very large range. Applying z-score normalization could help standardize this feature, making it easier for many models to work with.

3. \<CreditScore_Employment_relation\> \<multiply\> \<CreditScore\> \<Employment_ratio\> \<Interaction_between_credit_score_and_employment_ratio\>

   Reasoning: This feature combines credit score and employment ratio, possibly revealing how employment stability correlates with the assessed creditworthiness, providing an indication of potential future credit card approval success.
