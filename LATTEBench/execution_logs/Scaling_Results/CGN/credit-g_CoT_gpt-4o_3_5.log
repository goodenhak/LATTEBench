2026-01-30 12:20:15,061 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<checking_savings_combined\>cross\<checking_status\>\<savings_status\>\<combination_of_checking_and_savings_status\>  
This feature combines the checking_status and savings_status to capture the overall liquidity status of the applicant. This might help in understanding the applicant's short-term financial standing better than considering them independently.

2. \<log_credit_amount\>log\<credit_amount\>\<log_of_credit_amount\>  
Taking the logarithm of credit_amount can help in reducing skewness in the distribution of credit amounts, potentially improving model performance since many modeling techniques assume normally distributed input data.

3. \<duration_status\>bin\<duration\>\<binned_duration_by_quartiles\>  
Binning duration by its quartiles (e.g., 4-12 months as Q1, 12-18 as Q2, etc.) can help the model capture non-linear relationships between the duration of the credit and credit eligibility, making it easier for models, especially simpler ones, to learn these relationships.

2026-01-30 12:20:39,775 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential next steps for generating features using the provided operations:

1.  \<credit_duration_category\>\<bin\>\<duration\>\<Categorize the duration into bins to identify short, medium, and long-term credits\>
    - Reasoning: Categorizing the duration can help in understanding the distribution of durations and could be a significant factor in determining credit approval based on long, medium, or short-term credit needs.

2.  \<credit_history_checking_status_encoded\>\<cross\>\<credit_history_encoded\>\<checking_status_encoded\>\<Create an interaction between credit history and checking status for more granular analysis\>
    - Reasoning: Cross-interactions between encoded credit history and checking account status could uncover deeper patterns in credit approval decisions that are not visible through individual features alone.

3.  \<installment_commitment_to_age_ratio\>\<divide\>\<installment_commitment\>\<age_duration_ratio\>\<Calculate the ratio of installment commitment to age duration to understand the financial burden relative to age\>
    - Reasoning: Understanding how installment commitments compare to the ratio of age over duration could reveal potential financial strain and help predict creditworthiness.

These steps are developed to enhance the understanding of patterns that influence credit approval by capturing interactions and specific categorizations that might be indicative of creditworthiness.

Explanation:

1. Credit Amount to Savings Status Ratio: By creating a ratio of credit amount to savings status (after encoding the savings status), the model can gain insights into the credit demand relative to the financial stability indicated by savings, which could be a critical factor in credit risk assessment.

2. Employment to Credits Ratio: This feature assesses an individual's employment duration relative to their existing number of credits. Longer employment might indicate stability, while fewer credits can imply less financial strain. This ratio could help to identify individuals with more stable employment and fewer credit liabilities, potentially influencing credit decisions.

3. Dependents to Installment Ratio: This features the relationship between the number of dependents and the size of the installment commitment. A higher number of dependents with high installment commitments may indicate greater financial strain, potentially aiding in evaluating the applicant's financial burden.

2026-01-30 12:21:30,646 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential steps for feature engineering that might improve the downstream model's performance, along with the reasoning:

1. Given the importance of the credit history and checking status, creating an interaction term may help capture more nuanced information on financial behavior and account history. 

    
   <credit_history_checking_status_combined><concat><credit_history_encoded><checking_status_encoded><Combine_credit_history_and_checking_status_to_capture_joint_effects>
   

2. Since the credit amount and the employment status are key indicators for determining creditworthiness, creating a feature that combines these might reflect the reliability of the applicant in handling higher credit based on their employment status.

   
   <employment_credit_amount_cross><cross><employment><credit_amount><Capture_combined_financial_capability_from_employment_and_credit_amount>
   

3. Personal status, which reflects demographic factors such as gender and marital status, and housing status, which shows living situation, can be important determinants of creditworthiness. Creating an interaction feature could provide insights on how these personal factors influence credit decisions.

   Reasoning: Encoding the credit_duration_category into numerical values allows for easier integration in models that require numerical inputs and could help capture trends related to credit duration categories more effectively.

2. <employment_savings_property_interaction><cross><employment_savings_status_cross><property_magnitude><Capture_the_combined_effect_of_employment,_savings,_and_property_status_on_financial_stability>

   Reasoning: By constructing an interaction feature combining employment, savings status, and property, it's possible to capture multi-dimensional aspects of an individual's financial reliability that can be significant in determining credit eligibility.

3. <normalized_installment_commitment><minmax><installment_commitment><Scale_installment_commitment_to_a_range_of_0_to_1_for_standardization>

   Reasoning: Applying min-max scaling to the installment_commitment can help standardize its range, making it easier to compare across different data points and potentially improving the model's ability to weigh this feature appropriately.

2026-01-30 12:22:40,185 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Given the available features and the goal of improving prediction, here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operations:

1. \<checking_status_savings_status_cross\>\<cross\>\<checking_status\>\<savings_status\>\<Capture the interaction between checking account status and savings status to understand joint financial stability\>

   Reasoning: Combining both checking account and savings account status could reveal joint effects that individual statuses might not. This interaction might be crucial in understanding a person's overall financial stability and liquidity.

2. \<employment_duration_score\>\<multiply\>\<employment\>\<duration\>\<Assess long-term employment stability relative to loan duration\>

   Reasoning: By considering both employment status and the loan duration, we can create a feature that captures whether a person is likely to remain employed throughout the loan period, which might help in assessing the risk of credit default.

3. \<adjusted_installment_commitment\>\<ratio\>\<installment_commitment\>\<age_duration_ratio\>\<Adjust installment commitment by age to understand financial burden relative to applicant maturity over credit period\>

   Reasoning: Adjusting the installment commitment by the age-duration ratio can provide a clearer picture of the financial burden on an applicant, considering their age relative to the duration of the credit. This adjustment might help in identifying how sustainable an individual's financial commitments are.

2026-01-30 12:22:54,753 - INFO - LLM Output: Below are three potential next steps for feature engineering to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<adjusted_credit_amount_duration_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<age_duration_ratio\>\<Compute\ the\ ratio\ of\ credit\ amount\ to\ the\ product\ of\ age\ and\ duration\ to\ adjust\ for\ maturity\ and\ credit\ period\>

   Reasoning: By introducing the factor of age into the credit amount to duration ratio, you provide a more holistic view of credit demand intensity in relation to the borrower's age, potentially revealing better insights on creditworthiness. 

2. \<credit_savings_interaction\>\<cross\>\<credit_history\>\<savings_status\>\<Capture\ interaction\ between\ credit\ history\ and\ savings\ account/status,\ enhancing\ understanding\ of\ financial\ behavior\>

   Reasoning: This interaction can capture complex patterns related to how credit behaviors influence or are influenced by the savings status. It helps in evaluating financial stability and risk associated with credit granting.

3. \<normalized_installment_to_credits_ratio\>\<minmax\>\<installment_credits_ratio\>\<Normalize\ the\ installment\ to\ credits\ ratio\ for\ better\ comparison\ across\ different\ data\ points,\ ensuring\ consistent\ scaling\ and\ mitigating\ the\ impact\ of\ outliers\>

   Reasoning: By normalizing the installment to credits ratio, you can ensure that the feature values are on a consistent scale, improving model performance by preventing certain features from dominating due to range differences.

   This feature is designed to evaluate credit risk by comparing the credit amount to the savings status. A lower ratio may indicate higher financial stability, as it suggests the individual is requesting a smaller loan relative to their savings, potentially reducing default risk.

2. <employment_personal_status_encoded_cross><cross><employment><personal_status><Interactionbetweenemploymentandpersonalstatustoassessfinancialreliabilitybasedonemploymentpersonalcontext>

   Cross the employment status with personal status to capture the combined effect on financial reliability. This interaction may provide insights into how certain employment types and personal statuses correlate with credit approval.

3. <credit_amount_duration_sqrt><sqrt><credit_amount_duration_ratio><Rootofthecreditamountdurationratiotounveilnonlinearelationshipsbyreducingtheimpactofextremevalues>

   Applying the square root to the credit amount duration ratio will help mitigate the influence of extreme values, making the distribution more normal and potentially improving model performance by capturing subtler relationships with credit approval likelihood.

2026-01-30 12:23:17,719 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly, additional features can often improve the performance of a model by capturing more nuanced interactions or characteristics in the data. Here are three potential next steps for feature engineering:

1. <credit_age_financial_ratio><ratio><credit_amount_duration_ratio><age_duration_ratio><Ratio capturing the balance between credit demand intensity and the maturity of the applicant>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to combine the intensity of the credit demand (how much credit is demanded relative to the duration) with the maturity of the application relative to the credit period. Applicants with high credit demand but low maturity may pose a different risk profile than those with balanced values.

2. <risk_factor_cross><cross><credit_history_encoded><checking_status_encoded><Interaction capturing combined credit history and checking account status>
   - Reasoning: Interactions between the applicant's credit history and their current banking status can reveal intricate patterns in financial reliability. This combined feature may highlight specific combinations that are either more prone or resistant to credit risk.

3. <emergency_fund_index><plus><savings_status><employment_savings_status_cross><Composite feature representing available savings and stability of income which might be used in emergencies>
   - Reasoning: Combining savings status with employment and savings cross features can provide insights into the applicant's preparedness for financial emergencies. Higher values might indicate a lower risk for default, as there are more financial resources or stable conditions to draw upon in case of adversity.

2026-01-30 12:23:23,631 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, let's generate some possible new features using feature engineering techniques to potentially boost the downstream task performance. Given the data features and operators available, here are three possible next steps:

1. <balance_to_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><installment_commitment><ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment>  
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the financial burden by understanding how the total credit amount relates to the installment commitment. A higher ratio may indicate less financial stability and might correlate with credit risk.

2. <employment_stability><concat><employment><job><combination_of_employment_and_job>  
   - Reasoning: This feature combines employment duration with job type to provide insight into the applicant's employment stability, which can be a crucial factor in determining creditworthiness.
   
3. <creditworthiness_index><multiply><credit_history_encoded><credit_amount_duration_ratio><combined_credit_history_and_demand_intensity>  
   - Reasoning: This feature multiplies the encoded credit history with the credit amount to duration ratio to capture both past credit behavior and current credit demand intensity, providing a holistic view of credit risk.

These engineered features aim to highlight potential financial reliability, employment stability, and overall creditworthiness, which are crucial for the decision of whether a person receives credit or not.

2026-01-30 12:23:30,280 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps to generate new features using the available operations:

1. \<credit_amount_savings_status_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<savings_status\>\<This feature calculates the ratio of credit amount to savings status, providing insight into how a person's savings status relates to their credit demand.\>

2. \<employment_property_encoded\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<property_magnitude\>\<This feature encodes the interaction between employment and property magnitude, potentially capturing the financial stability of individuals based on their property ownership.\>

3. \<age_installment_commitment_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<installment_commitment\>\<age_duration_ratio\>\<This feature calculates the ratio of installment commitment to the age duration ratio, providing a measure of financial burden relative to the applicant's age and credit duration.\>

### Reasoning:
- Step 1: The credit_amount_savings_status_ratio aims to provide a numerical feature indicating the relationship between how much credit a person is seeking relative to their savings. This could be a valuable predictor of financial risk or creditworthiness.
  
- Step 2: The employment_property_encoded builds on the existing categorical features by creating an encoded version that reflects the interaction between employment status and property magnitude. This can highlight potential differences in financial reliability and risk.

- Step 3: The age_installment_commitment_ratio would add a new dimension by comparing the installment commitment to the age and duration, possibly indicating the financial burden a credit seeker is facing in relation to their age and credit term maturity. This could help model insights into financial stress points or sustainability of credit repayments.

2026-01-30 12:23:47,314 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_amount_log\><log\><credit_amount\><Log transformation of credit_amount to reduce skewness and stabilize variance for better model performance\>
   
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range with potential skewness. Applying a log transformation can help in stabilizing variance and reducing skewness, often leading to better model predictions by handling extreme values more effectively.

2. \<checking_savings_cross\><cross\><checking_status><savings_status\><Creating a feature that captures the interaction between checking status and savings status\>

   Reasoning: The individual effects of the financial status represented by checking and savings accounts might not capture their joint influence on the credit decision. Creating a cross feature may uncover interaction effects between checking and savings statuses that are crucial to predicting credit approval.

3. \<age_credit_ratio\><ratio\><age_duration_ratio><credit_amount_duration_ratio\><Calculating the ratio of age to credit amount duration to assess how personal maturity relative to credit demand impacts credit decisions\>

   Reasoning: The age_duration_ratio and credit_amount_duration_ratio individually provide insights into maturity and credit demand. However, their interaction through a ratio might reveal critical insights into how age-related maturity relative to the credit demand impacts the likelihood of receiving credit.

These steps aim to enhance the model's performance by capturing interactions and assessing liabilities more comprehensively:

1. By creating a cross feature between checking status and credit history, the feature \<checking_status_credit_history_score\> can capture nuanced behaviors related to account status and credit history, improving the model's ability to identify creditworthiness.

2. The combined feature \<employment_stability_score\> derived from employment and job type captures the interplay between job stability and employment type, which can be indicative of an applicant's ability to repay credit over time.

3. The feature \<financial_liability_index\> evaluates how installment commitments weigh against existing credit accounts, providing a clearer picture of financial burden and potential repayment challenges.
