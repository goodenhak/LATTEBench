   - Reasoning: Normalizing the 'loc' feature using Z-score can help in improving the model's handling of features with high variance, making the model potentially perform better by treating each feature with equal importance.

2. <complexity_ratio><divide><v(g)><loc><Ratio of cyclomatic complexity to line count>
   - Reasoning: The ratio between cyclomatic complexity and line count can be a strong indicator of how complex a module is relative to its size. Higher ratios might point to complexity that is not justified by the size of code, potentially leading to problems.

3. <halstead_volume_effort_interaction><multiply><v><e><Interaction between Halstead volume and effort>
   - Reasoning: By creating a feature that represents the combined effect of volume and effort, we can capture the interaction between how complex a module is and the effort needed to maintain it. This might reveal modules that are too complex or require disproportionate effort, enhancing the prediction of defects.

Explanation:

1. Ratio of Halstead Effort to Volume: By calculating the ratio of Halstead effort to volume, we may uncover insights into how effort invested in code correlates with the volume of the code, which can impact defects. If higher efforts correlate with larger volumes, it may indicate more complex modules with potential for defects.

2. Cyclomatic Complexity Squared: Squaring cyclomatic complexity can amplify the effects of complexity in the prediction model. Modules with higher complexity might be more prone to defects, and emphasizing this feature could improve defect prediction accuracy.

3. Normalized Cyclomatic Complexity: Applying a Z-score normalization to cyclomatic complexity can help reduce the impact of varying scales within this feature. Normalization may contribute to better model convergence and improve predictions by making this feature more comparable across samples.

Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

2026-01-30 13:30:03,032 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! When generating new features for a downstream task like software defect prediction, the goal is to create meaningful interactions, transformations, or aggregations that could enhance the predictive power of a model. We will utilize a variety of operations to transform the features, keeping in mind the nature of the data and the potential relationships between the features that may have implications on software defects.

1. Generating squared terms and higher-order interactions can help model non-linear relationships that might not be captured by linear models.
2. Normalizing or standardizing features helps with convergence and correctness in models that are sensitive to feature magnitudes.
3. Exploring ratios or interactions between features can reveal underlying performance metrics that are critical in understanding defect propensity.

Here's a list of feature engineering steps:

1. \<volatility_density_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<volatility_metric\>\<volume_per_line_of_code\>\<Interaction_of_volatility_and_density_to_identify_potential_risk_areas>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying these two metrics can surface modules with both high volatility and complexity, which are often linked to defects.

2. \<normalized_design_vs_cyclomatic\>\<divide\>\<iv(g)\>\<v(g)\>\<Normalized_ratio_of_design_complexity_to_cyclomatic_complexity_providing_insight_into_code_stability>
   - Reasoning: The ratio between design complexity and cyclomatic complexity after normalizing iv(g) can illuminate stability concerns, enhancing the ability to locate potential defect-prone modules.

3. \<log_effort_density_change\>\<log\>\<density_change\>\<Logarithmic_transformation_of_density_change_to_handle_wide_value_range_and_mitigate_skewness>
   - Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to the density change feature may help in reducing the effect of outliers and expressing data in a more interpretable range, thereby aiding in the identification processes. (Note: you may need to adjust this operation if zero or negative values are present, by offsetting accordingly before taking log.)

These operations aim to capture and highlight insights from significant interaction effects, ratios, and transformations whose linear or nonlinear relationships may influence the likelihood of defects.

2026-01-30 13:30:16,301 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps using the provided operators to enhance the predictive power for the KC1 Software defect prediction task:

1. <normalized_volatility_effort_ratio><divide><volatility_metric><normalized_halstead_effort><Ratio_of_code_volatility_to_normalized_Halstead_effort_identifying_modules_with_high_combined_risk>
   - Reasoning: By creating a normalized ratio of the volatility of a module to the normalized Halstead effort, we can identify modules that might exhibit high-risk characteristics due to a combination of high volatility and high complexity, thus potentially being more prone to defects.

2. <inverse_stability_complexity_interaction><multiply><essential_to_cyclomatic_ratio><complexity_ratio><Interaction_of_design_stability_and_complexity_ratio_to_identify_areas_with_both_stable_design_and_high_complexity>
   - Reasoning: This feature effectively captures modules that are stable in design yet have high complexity. High complexity can introduce defects, but if combined with stable design, it might be a crucial factor for prediction. The multiplicative interaction allows emphasis on cases where both complexity and stability are present together.

3. <log_volatility_density_interaction><log><volatility_density_interaction><Logarithmic_transformation_of_volatility_and_density_interaction_to_reduce_skewness_and_handle_extreme_values>
   - Reasoning: Given the large range and possible skewness in the volatility_density_interaction feature, applying a logarithmic transformation reduces skewness and stabilizes variance, potentially improving the ability of the predictive model to utilize this feature effectively by mitigating the impact of extremely high values.

   - Reasoning: Squaring the volatility_effort_interaction can help capture any non-linear effects associated with combined volatility and effort, potentially providing a more refined measure of risk due to complex interactions.

2. <stability_effort_abs><abs><stability_effort_interaction><Absolute_value_of_stability_effort_interaction_to_ignore_direction_of_interaction>
   - Reasoning: Taking the absolute value of stability_effort_interaction may emphasize the magnitude of the interaction irrespective of its direction, which is helpful if the interaction's strength is more informative than its sign regarding defects.

3. <effort_density_volatility_ratio><ratio><effort_density_normalized><volatility_metric><Ratio_of_effort_density_to_volatility_to_capture_modules_with_high_effort_and_volatility>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of effort density to volatility metric can help identify modules with high effort and high volatility, which may indicate areas that are riskier and more prone to defects due to simultaneous complexity and effort demand.

   Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to the volatility_effort_interaction feature can help reduce skewness and make its distribution more normal, which may improve model performance.

2. \<interaction_density_stability\><multiply>\<density_change\>\<stability_effort_interaction\><Interaction_between_density_change_and_stability_effort_to_identify_complexity_risks\>

   Reasoning: Creating a new feature as the product of density_change and stability_effort_interaction could highlight modules with fluctuating efforts and stability, which are potentially riskier.

3. \<normalized_volume_per_line\><zscore>\<volume_per_line_of_code\><Z_score_normalization_of_volume_per_line_of_code_to_standardize_and_remove_scale_effects\>

   Reasoning: Standardizing volume_per_line_of_code using Z-score normalization removes scale effects and can make this feature more comparable to others, potentially improving the model's ability to leverage it effectively.

2026-01-30 13:31:04,910 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the given operations, aiming to improve the predictions of software defects:

1. Combining measures of volatility and density can highlight potential risk areas in code modules that could contribute to defects. This interaction is particularly insightful given the roles both factors play in assessing software module stability and complexity.
   
   <volatility_density_ratio><ratio><volatility_metric><volume_per_line_of_code><Measure_ratio_of_volatility_to_density_to_identify_risk_areas>

2. The effort interaction with branching, a core aspect of control flow, can help gauge the complexity and maintenance challenges of a code module. As branching influences control paths, the effort-density interplay with branching could highlight potential defect-prone modules.
   
   <effort_branch_interaction><multiply><effort_density_normalized><branchCount><Interaction_of_effort_density_and_branching_to_identify_complex_modules>

3. Assessing the fluctuation between the essential complexity ratio and effort density change can give insights into design stability over time. Modules with high fluctuations might be more vulnerable to defects due to inconsistent design efforts.

   Reasoning: The original volatility_effort_interaction feature has a wide range and high variability, as indicated by its high standard deviation. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help stabilize the variance and reduce skewness, which might improve model performance by making the data distribution more normal.

2. \<normalized_volume_effort_interaction\><zscore>\<halstead_volume_effort_interaction\>\<Normalize_halstead_volume_effort_interaction_to_standardize_and_remove_scale_effects\>

   Reasoning: The halstead_volume_effort_interaction has a very high mean and standard deviation. Creating a z-score normalized version of this feature will help standardize it, allowing models to treat it on the same scale as other features, reducing the influence of outliers.

3. \<volume_cyclomatic_ratio\><ratio>\<volume_per_line_of_code\>\<v(g)\>\<Calculate_the_ratio_of_volume_per_line_of_code_to_cyclomatic_complexity_to_assess_code_density_vs_complexity\>

   Reasoning: This feature examines the relationship between code volume density and cyclomatic complexity. Modules with high volume but low complexity might indicate oversimplification or verbosity in code, while high complexity and low volume could indicate high potential defect rates due to complex logic. This ratio could provide new insights into code quality not captured by the two features individually.

2026-01-30 13:31:48,220 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features using the operations provided:

1. \<volatility_code_complexity_interaction\><multiply>\<volatility_metric\>\<complexity_ratio\>\<Interaction_between_code_volatility_and_complexity_ratio_to_identify_modules_with_high_risk>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between volatility and complexity ratio, which could help identify modules with high risk due to both volatile code changes and high complexity, potentially improving the defect prediction accuracy.

2. \<normalized_total_operators\><zscore>\<total_Op\>\<Z_score_normalization_of_total_operators_to_identify_outlier_modules>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the total number of operators using Z-score can help in identifying outlier modules that might be prone to defects due to unusually high or low operator counts, allowing the model to better handle the variability in operator usage.

3. \<volume_effort_interaction_log\><log>\<halstead_volume_effort_interaction\>\<Logarithmic_transformation_of_Halstead_volume_effort_interaction_to_handle_skewness>
   - Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation on the Halstead volume-effort interaction will help in reducing skewness in the data, making it easier for the model to learn patterns and potentially improving predictive performance for modules with extreme values.

2026-01-30 13:31:59,109 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps that could help improve the predictions in the KC1 Software defect prediction task:

1. \<complexity_effort_interaction\><multiply><complexity_ratio><normalized_halstead_effort><Interaction_between_complexity_and_effort_to_identify_modules_with_combined_risk>
   - Reasoning: By capturing the interaction between complexity and effort, you can identify modules that might be at a higher risk of defects due to the combined effects of both high complexity and high effort.

2. \<volatility_density_ratio\><divide><volatility_metric><volume_per_line_of_code><Ratio_of_volatility_to_density_to_identify_code_with_potential_high_risk_due_to_combined_complexity_measures>
   - Reasoning: This ratio helps quantify the relationship between volatility and density, providing insights into areas of code that may be particularly complex or difficult to maintain, which could correlate with defect proneness.

3. \<log_volatile_effort_interaction\><log><volatility_effort_interaction><Log_transformation_of_volatility_effort_interaction_to_handle_skewness_and_identify_high_risk_modules>
   - Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation can help manage the wide range of the volatility effort interaction feature and mitigate skewness, making it easier to identify high-risk modules that could contribute to defects.

These feature engineering steps aim to provide additional insights into the complexity, volatility, and effort characteristics of the code, which can be critical indicators of defect proneness in the KC1 dataset.

### Explanation:

1. Logarithmic Transformation of Volatility Metric: 
   - Applying a logarithmic transformation to the volatility_metric feature can help reduce the impact of extreme values and skewness, making the data more normal. This can improve model performance by stabilizing variance within the dataset.

2. Interaction of Normalized Halstead Effort with Cyclomatic Complexity: 
   - By creating an interaction feature between the normalized_halstead_effort and v(g) (cyclomatic complexity), we can capture areas in the code that not only require high cognitive effort but are also complex, leading to a potential defect-prone area.

3. Stability Effort Fluctuation Ratio:
   - This ratio highlights areas where the fluctuation in stability effort is disproportionate to the actual stability effort interaction. This measure identifies modules with volatile complexity patterns, providing insights into potential defects due to irregular design efforts.

These proposed features aim to refine the existing measurements and interactions:

1. Volatility Effort Risk Ratio: This feature is designed to capture the balance between code volatility and effort normalized by Halstead. Given that both components capture aspects of code complexity and effort, this ratio can help identify modules that may be especially prone to defects due to a combination of high volatility and effort.

2. Volatility Log Interaction: Converting the volatility and effort interaction into its logarithmic form helps handle the wide range of values and mitigate the skewness. This transformation can be key to reducing the impact of outliers and thus could provide a more stable feature input for models.

3. Density Volatility Mean: A rolling mean for volatility density interaction gives a smoother view of its progression, smoothing out peaks and identifying consistent risk patterns rather than singular spikes. This can be useful for uncovering modules with sustained high-risk due to consistent volatility and density patterns over time.

2026-01-30 13:32:16,838 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<volatility_metric_log\>\<log\>\<volatility_metric\>\<Logarithmic_transformation_of_volatility_metric_to_reduce_skewness_and_scale_down_large_values\>
   
   Reasoning: The volatility_metric has a large range and high standard deviation, indicating potential skewness. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help stabilize variance and reduce the skewness, possibly improving the predictive capability by handling the wide range of values more effectively.

2. \<complexity_vs_effort_ratio\>\<divide\>\<complexity_ratio\>\<normalized_halstead_effort\>\<Ratio_of_complexity_to_effort_measuring_balance_between_code_complexity_and_effort_expenditure\>
   
   Reasoning: By creating a ratio of complexity_ratio to normalized_halstead_effort, the balance between the complexity of the code and the effort required can be assessed. This could identify modules where high complexity does not align with the effort, potentially revealing areas prone to defects.

3. \<volatility_density_interaction_sqrt\>\<sqrt\>\<volatility_density_interaction\>\<Square_root_transformation_of_volatility_density_interaction_to_reduce_effect_of_outliers_and_large_values\>

   Reasoning: The volatility_density_interaction feature has a very large range and high standard deviation. Applying a square root transformation can reduce the effect of outliers and normalize the data distribution, potentially enhancing model performance by reducing the influence of extremely large values or outliers.

   Reasoning: By creating a ratio between the volatility_metric and the normalized_halstead_effort, we can capture how risky a module might be due to its volatility alongside its normalized effort, which could be a strong indicator of potential defects.

2. \<code_density_effort\>\<multiply\>\<volume_per_line_of_code\>\<effort_density_normalized\>\<Interaction_between_code_density_and_normalized_effort_to_identify_complex_and_effort_intense_modules\>

   Reasoning: This feature interacts the code density (volume_per_line_of_code) with the effort density (effort_density_normalized). Modules with high density and effort might be more complex and, thus, more prone to defects.

3. \<stability_complexity_inv\>\<reciprocal\>\<essential_to_cyclomatic_ratio\>\<Inverse_of_essential_to_cyclomatic_ratio_to_emphasize_modules_with_lower_design_stability\>

   Reasoning: Calculating the inverse of essential_to_cyclomatic_ratio can highlight modules with low design stability. Such modules might have high potential for defects, as a low design stability can indicate complex interactions and less maintainability.

2026-01-30 13:32:44,372 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations provided:

1. Create an interaction feature to capture complex relationships between volatility and effort, which could play a critical role in defect prediction given that both metrics indicate risk and complexity.

2. Generate a feature to handle skewness and potential outliers in the halstead_volume_effort_interaction by applying a logarithmic transformation. This can help to stabilize variance and normalize the data distribution, which might improve model performance.

   plaintext
   <log_halstead_volume_effort_interaction><log><halstead_volume_effort_interaction><Logarithmic_transformation_of_halstead_volume_effort_interaction_to_reduce_skewness>
   

3. Calculate a rolling mean of density_change to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends, potentially uncovering areas with consistent fluctuations contributing to defects.

   plaintext
   <density_change_rolling_mean><rolling_mean><density_change><Rolling_mean_of_density_change_smoothing_out_short_term_fluctuations_highlighting_longer_term_trends>

2026-01-30 13:32:54,157 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! When performing feature engineering for software defect prediction, we aim to enhance the predictive power of the dataset by generating new features that capture additional insights about the underlying patterns regarding defects. Here are three possible next steps for creating new features:

1. <volatility_effort_ratio><divide><volatility_metric><normalized_halstead_effort><Ratio_of_code_volatility_to_normalized_Halstead_effort_listing_modules_in_critical_balance_between_complexity_and_effort>
   - Reasoning: By examining the ratio of volatility to normalized Halstead effort, we identify modules where a high level of code changes (volatility) correlates with effort, which could indicate a high-risk area for defects due to consistent refactoring or disorder.

2. <mean_complexity_effort><plus><complexity_ratio><effort_density_normalized><Combined_Mean_Of_Complexity_And_Normalized_Effort_Highlighting_Both_Logical_Severalty_And_Hardwork_For_Any_Module>
   - Reasoning: Adding complexity ratio and effort density normalized provides a composite score highlighting modules both logically complex and requiring significant effort. This double pressure might lead to higher defect risks.

3. <stability_volatility_multiply><stability_effort_interaction><volatility_density_interaction><Interaction_Of_Stability_And_Volatility_To_Tackle_Areas_With_Clashing_Distribution_Of_Stability_And_Change>
   - Reasoning: The interaction of stability and volatility could highlight sections of the code where the stability of the code is in direct contention with high volatility. Areas with this behavior might suffer from coordination issues or execution flaws, leading to defects.

These steps harness the existing feature set's complexity and introduce nuanced variables that capture multifaceted interactions in the data, potentially improving the downstream task of predicting software defects.

2026-01-30 13:32:59,881 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<log_volatility_metric\><log><volatility_metric>\<Logarithmic transformation of volatility_metric to manage skewness and wide value range\>

    Reasoning: The original range of the volatility_metric is quite wide. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help in reducing skewness and managing extreme values, making patterns easier to identify for the model.

2. \<code_complexity_interaction\><multiply><lOCode><v(g)>\<Interaction between lines of code and cyclomatic complexity to capture potential intricate complexity\>

    Reasoning: This interaction captures the relationship between the size of the code (lOCode) and its complexity (v(g)). This compound metric may indicate areas where high complexity accompanies high code volume, potentially revealing defect-prone modules.

3. \<density_effort_ratio\><ratio><volume_per_line_of_code><normalized_effort_density>\<Ratio of code volume density to normalized effort density for identifying inefficiencies\>

    Reasoning: This ratio examines how the density of the code (volume_per_line_of_code) relates to the normalized effort (normalized_effort_density). Modules with high density relative to effort might indicate inefficiencies or potential problem areas that are not aligned with the expected effort, revealing potential defects.

2026-01-30 13:33:06,059 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering aimed at improving the predictive performance of the KC1 software defect prediction task:

1. \<effort_complexity_interaction\><multiply>\<normalized_halstead_effort\>\<v(g)\>\<Interaction_of_Halstead_effort_and_cyclomatic_complexity_to_identify_modules_with_combined_complexity_thus_potential_defect_proneness\>  
   *Reasoning*: By creating a feature that combines normalized Halstead effort and cyclomatic complexity (v(g)), we identify modules that require more effort to handle complexity, potentially increasing defect proneness.

2. \<volatility_to_density_ratio\><divide>\<volatility_metric\>\<volume_per_line_of_code\>\<Ratio_of_code_volatility_to_density_indicating_potential_vulnerability_due_to_high_volatility_and_complex_code\>  
   *Reasoning*: This feature identifies areas with high code volatility relative to its density, which might highlight modules that are complex yet volatile, potentially leading to more defects.

3. \<stability_vs_change_score\><subtract>\<stability_effort_interaction\>\<density_change\>\<Difference_between_stability_effort_and_density_change_highlighting_fluctuations_related_to_defects\>  
   *Reasoning*: By subtracting density change from the stability effort interaction, this feature can help identify modules with unstable, fluctuating code that might be more defect-prone due to unexpected effort changes.

2026-01-30 13:33:12,667 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible steps to generate additional features that might improve the software defect prediction model's performance:

1. \<complexity_density_ratio\>\<divide\>\<complexity_code_ratio\>\<locCodeAndComment\>\<Calculate_the_ratio_of_complexity_to_lines_of_code_with_comments_to_identify_dense_areas_with_high_maintenance_potential\>

   *Reasoning*: By considering comments, which often provide important context and documentation, this feature helps assess whether modules with greater complexity have adequate documentation, potentially impacting maintainability and defect prediction.

2. \<log_volatility_effort_ratio\>\<log\>\<divide\>\<volatility_metric\>\<effort_density_normalized\>\<Apply_a_log_transformation_to_ratio_between_volatility_and_normalized_effort_density_to_smooth_values_and_handle_skewness\>

   *Reasoning*: High volatility combined with high effort density may indicate unstable regions prone to defects. Taking the logarithm helps stabilize extreme values and reduces skewness, potentially making this pattern more discernible for the model.

3. \<interaction_norm_effort_design\>\<multiply\>\<normalized_halstead_effort\>\<normalized_design_vs_cyclomatic\>\<Capture_the_interaction_between_normalized_effort_and_design_stability_to_identify_modules_where_effort_and_design_complexity_combined_may_affect_stability\>

   *Reasoning*: By examining the interaction between normalized effort and design complexity, this feature highlights areas where the burden of complex designs combined with high effort might contribute to defects, providing a nuanced view of stability risks.

2026-01-30 13:33:28,218 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the downstream model's performance using feature engineering, we can create new features that capture complex interactions or transformations of existing ones. Below are three possible next steps for generating new features:

1. Interaction Feature:
   - <stability_effort_volatility_interaction><multiply><stability_effort_interaction><volatility_effort_interaction><Combined_effect_of_stability_and_volatility_on_effort>
   - Reasoning: This new feature captures the joint effect of stability and volatility on effort, which could provide insights into modules that are both unstable and volatile, potentially indicating higher defect risk.

2. Complexity and Effort Interaction:
   - <complexity_effort_ratio><divide><v(g)><normalized_effort_density><Relation_between_complexity_and_effort_density>
   - Reasoning: This feature explores the relationship between cyclomatic complexity and effort density, which could highlight areas where complex code requires disproportionate effort, possibly indicating defect-prone areas.

3. Log-Transformed Feature:
   - <log_volatility_density_interaction><log><volatility_density_interaction><Log_transform_of_volatility_density_interaction_for_skewness_reduction>
   - Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to reduce skewness and handle wide ranges can help improve model performance by making this feature's distribution more normal, which is often beneficial for many machine learning algorithms.

These engineered features aim to capture complex patterns and interactions in the data, potentially enhancing the model's ability to predict software defects accurately.

Reasoning:

1. By applying a logarithmic transformation to the normalized_design_vs_cyclomatic feature, we can potentially address any nonlinearity and skewness in the data. This can help improve the performance of linear models that are sensitive to feature distribution.

2. Creating a ratio of v(g) (cyclomatic complexity) and branchCount gives insight into the complexity of the control flow within the module. This feature might be indicative of more complex conditional structures, which could correlate with defects.

3. The interaction of complexity_ratio and normalized_halstead_effort can uncover combined effects of code complexity and effort. Modules that are both complex and effort-intensive could be more prone to defects, making this feature valuable for prediction.

   Reasoning: Multiplying volatility with effort density could help identify areas with a combination of high volatility and high effort density, which may be prone to defects.

2. \<log_normalized_effort_density\>\<log\>\<normalized_effort_density\>\<Logarithmic_transformation_of_normalized_effort_density_to_reduce_skewness_and_emphasize_outliers\>

   Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to normalized effort density helps manage the wide range of values and emphasize potential outliers, aiding in detecting complex areas.

3. \<cyclomatic_to_operational_density\>\<divide\>\<v(g)\>\<total_Op\>\<Ratio_of_cyclomatic_complexity_to_total_operators_indicating_code_complexity_relative_to_operational_elements\>

   Reasoning: Comparing cyclomatic complexity to the number of operators gives insight into how complex the code is relative to its operational components. This could help identify modules where operational complexity is disproportionate.
