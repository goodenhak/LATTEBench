2026-01-30 13:17:04,727 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, here are three potential feature engineering steps aimed at improving the prediction of credit card application success:

1. <DebtToIncomeRatio><divide><Debt><Income><RatioOfDebtToIncomeForCreditWorthyAssessment>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of debt to income is a commonly used metric by financial institutions to assess creditworthiness. A lower ratio is generally seen as more favorable. This feature could play a crucial role in determining a person's financial stability and their likelihood of being approved for a credit card.

2. <EmployedYearsAgeRatio><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><RatioOfYearsEmployedToAgeForExperienceAssessment>
   - Reasoning: This feature represents the proportion of a person's life they have been employed. It could be interpreted as a measure of stability or experience for a given age, potentially impacting an individual's creditworthiness and likelihood of credit card approval.

3. <PriorDefaultBankCustomerInteraction><cross><PriorDefault><BankCustomer><InteractionBetweenPriorDefaultAndBankCustomerStatus>
   - Reasoning: Interacting prior default status with bank customer status might reveal patterns where having a prior default negatively impacts bank customers more or less compared to non-bank customers. This new feature may help capture nuanced risk levels associated with prior defaults in different customer scenarios.

2026-01-30 13:17:11,511 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features to potentially improve the downstream task of predicting credit card application success:

1. Create an interaction feature between employment status and years employed:
   
   <EmployedYearsInteraction><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_years_employed>
   
   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between being employed and the number of years employed. Those who are employed and have been employed for a longer time might be more stable and thus have a higher likelihood of being successful in credit card applications.

2. Calculate the debt-to-income ratio:
   
   <DebtIncomeRatio><divide><Debt><Income><Debt_to_Income_ratio>
   
   Reasoning: The debt-to-income ratio is a key indicator of financial stability. A lower ratio typically indicates better financial health, which could correlate with a higher probability of credit card application success.

3. Categorize applicants based on their age group:
   
   <AgeGroup><bin><Age><Categorize_applicants_by_age_group>
   
   Reasoning: Age often correlates with different stages in life, which can influence financial behavior and creditworthiness. Categorizing applicants into age groups can help capture these differences and improve prediction accuracy.

2026-01-30 13:17:16,652 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operations. The goal is to improve the prediction of whether individuals will be successful in applying for a credit card:

1. Feature Interaction with Credit Score and Employment:
   - Reasoning: Both employment status and credit score are critical indicators of financial stability and creditworthiness. Interacting these features could help capture complex relationships that might be indicative of credit card success.
   - <CreditScore_Employed_Interaction><multiply><CreditScore><Employed><Interaction_of_CreditScore_and_Employed_Status>

2. Debt-to-Income Ratio:
   - Reasoning: This ratio is a common metric used in credit evaluations to assess an individual's ability to manage monthly payments and repay debts. A lower ratio is typically favorable, indicating better financial health.
   - <DebtToIncomeRatio><divide><Debt><Income><Debt_to_Income_Ratio>

3. Marital and Employment Status Combination:
   - Reasoning: This feature might capture demographic segments more likely to be credit-worthy. For instance, married individuals with steady employment might be favored by credit issuers.
   - <MarriedEmployedCross><cross><Married><Employed><Combination_of_Marital_and_Employment_Status> 

These derived features aim to capture interactions and ratios that may provide more granular insights into an individual's financial situation and creditworthiness, potentially improving model predictions.

   - Explanation: The IncomeRatio feature has a high variance with extreme values. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help stabilize variance and improve the performance of models sensitive to outliers.

2. <Industry_label><label_encode><Industry><Numeric_representation_of_Industry_categories>
   - Explanation: Converting the categorical Industry feature to a numerical representation will allow the model to effectively use this feature. Label encoding is used as a straightforward method to achieve this transformation.

3. <PriorDefault_Age_cross><cross><PriorDefault><Age><Interaction_between_PriorDefault_and_Age>
   - Explanation: Creating an interaction term between PriorDefault and Age might capture complex patterns regarding how age influences credit card application success differently, depending on prior defaults. This can be particularly useful if there are nonlinear effects.

   Reasoning: Applying a square root transformation can help to reduce the skewness of highly skewed variables such as IncomeRatio. This can improve the performance of models that assume a normal distribution of features.

2. \<YearsEmployed_bin\>\<bin\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Binned_years_employed_to_categorize_different_experience_levels>

   Reasoning: Binning the YearsEmployed feature can help capture non-linear relationships between employment duration and the likelihood of successful credit card application, which might be important depending on the underlying trends or patterns in the data.

3. \<Industry_IncomeRatio_mean\>\<groupbythenmean\>\<Industry\>\<IncomeRatio\>\<Average_IncomeRatio_by_Industry_to_identify_peculiarities_in_earning_patterns_by_sector>

   Reasoning: Calculating the average IncomeRatio by Industry can highlight differences in economic behavior across industries, potentially revealing insights about which industry sectors are more financially stable and, therefore, more likely to succeed in credit card applications.

2026-01-30 13:17:46,399 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature generation:

1. \<PriorDefault_Age_encoded\><label_encode>\<PriorDefault_Age_cross\>\<Encoding_of\_PriorDefault\_Age_cross\_as_numerical_for_better_integration\>
   - Reasoning: By encoding the 'PriorDefault_Age_cross' as a numerical feature, we can leverage its interaction information in various numerical transformations or models that don't directly handle categorical input. Encoded numerical values can also be directly used with operators such as 'multiply' or 'divide' with other numerical features.

2. \<IncomeRatio_log_Industry_mean_ratio\><divide>\<IncomeRatio_log\>\<Industry_IncomeRatio_mean\>\<Ratio_of\_IncomeRatio_log_to_Industry_IncomeRatio_mean_for_outlier_detection\>
   - Reasoning: Checking the ratio of 'IncomeRatio_log' to 'Industry_IncomeRatio_mean' might identify individuals whose income to debt ratio is extremely divergent when adjusted for industry norms, potentially identifying unique risk profiles or financial stability.

3. \<Age_YearsEmployed_combined\><multiply>\<Age\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Combination_of\_Age_and_YearsEmployed_as_synthesis_feature_enhances_capture_of_experience-related__financial_behaviors\>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying 'Age' by 'YearsEmployed' generates a continuous synthesis feature that could capture the compounded effects of aging with experience on financial behavior, possibly enhancing the predictive power for credit card application outcomes.

2026-01-30 13:17:57,370 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the prediction of who is successful in applying for a credit card, we can generate new features using the existing ones. Here are three possible feature engineering steps that could potentially enhance the downstream model's performance:

1. \<IncomeRatio_PriorDefault_interaction\> \<ratio\> \<IncomeRatio\> \<PriorDefault\> \<Interaction_between_IncomeRatio_and_PriorDefault\_to_identify_how_prior_defaults_influence_financial_stability\>
   - Reasoning: This feature will help in capturing how a person's income-to-debt ratio is influenced by their history of prior defaults, providing insights into their financial stability and risk of default.

2. \<Experienced_Stability\> \<multiply\>  \<YearsEmployed\> \<IncomeRatio_stability\> \<Experience_and_financial_stability_interaction\>
   - Reasoning: By combining YearsEmployed and IncomeRatio_stability, we can gauge the impact of employment experience on an individual's financial stability, leading to better understanding of risk patterns.

3. \<Age_Encoded\> \<label_encode\> \<Age_PriorDefault_interaction\> \<Encoded_representation_of_interaction_between_age_and_prior_default_status\>
   - Reasoning: Converting this categorical interaction feature into a numerical label-encoded format could help some algorithms (like linear models) make more effective use of this information in predicting credit card application success.

These newly engineered features are aimed at capturing interactions and influences between existing variables, which might help the model identify complex patterns better aligned with successful credit card applications.

2026-01-30 13:18:09,498 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that could improve the model's performance:

1. Interaction between Age and Industry_IncomeRatio_mean: This feature could capture how a person's age, combined with the average income ratio of their industry, affects their likelihood of being successful in applying for a credit card.

   - <Age_IndustryIncomeRatio_mean_interaction><multiply><Age><Industry_IncomeRatio_mean><Interaction_between_Age_and_Industry_IncomeRatio_mean>

2. Normalized YearsEmployed: Normalizing the YearsEmployed feature could help in reducing potential biases caused by different scales, allowing the model to treat the relative difference in years more consistently.

   - <YearsEmployed_normalized><zscore><YearsEmployed><Z_score_transformed_YearsEmployed_to_normalize_across_data_set>

3. Income Ratio Log-Cosine Transformation: Using a cosine transformation on the logarithm of the IncomeRatio could help capture cyclic patterns and handle large values more effectively, potentially uncovering hidden patterns related to successful credit card applications.

   - <IncomeRatio_log_cosine><cosine><IncomeRatio_log><Cosine_transformation_on_IncomeRatio_log_to_identify_cyclic_patterns> 

By generating these new features, we aim to capture interactions, normalize scales, and identify potential cyclic patterns, which could improve the predictability of the models.

   Reasoning: Normalizing the Industry_IncomeRatio_mean with a Z-score transformation helps handle outliers and ensures the feature is centered around zero with a standard deviation of one. This can be useful for algorithms sensitive to feature scales and might reveal peculiarities more effectively.

2. <Income_to_Experience_ratio><divide><IncomeRatio><YearsEmployed_Age_combined><Ratio_of_Income_to_Experience_combined_to_identify_financial_behavior_related_to_work_experience>

   Reasoning: Calculating a ratio of IncomeRatio to YearsEmployed_Age_combined could expose how income relative to debt grows or diminishes with age and experience, which might be a critical determinant of credit card application success.

3. <PriorDefault_Income_interaction_score><multiply><PriorDefault><Industry_IncomeRatio_mean><Interaction_score_between_PriorDefault_and_Industry_IncomeRatio_mean_to_capture_effect_of_prior_defaults_on_income_patterns>

   Reasoning: This feature is designed to understand how prior defaults interact with income ratios within different industries. Such interaction scores could help decode behavior patterns influencing credit card application decisions, given that prior defaults might impact financial stability or perceived risk differently across income levels or industrial sectors.

   - Reasoning: This feature will capture the relationship between age and years employed. Individuals with a high ratio have been employed for a relatively shorter period compared to their age, potentially indicating job instability or late career start which might influence creditworthiness.

2. <IncomeRatio_meanAge_zipGroup><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Age><Mean_Age_by_ZipCode_to_identify_age_distribution_effect_on_IncomeRatio>
   - Reasoning: By calculating the average age for each ZipCode group, we can explore regional age-economic behavior effects. This could help identify areas with specific age-driven financial traits impacting credit applications.

3. <IncomeRatio_stability_normalized><zscore><IncomeRatio_stability><Z-score_normalized_IncomeRatio_stability_to_standardize_across_regions>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing IncomeRatio_stability with Z-score helps in identifying outliers and standardizing the feature, which can produce more consistent results while evaluating financial stability across different regions.

2026-01-30 13:18:39,226 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three steps to generate new features:

1. <YearsEmployed_Age_ratio><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><Ratio_of_YearsEmployed_to_Age_to_identify_relative_experience_level>

   Reasoning: By calculating the ratio of Years Employed to Age, we gain insight into the applicant's stability and consistency in employment relative to their age, potentially adding value to the prediction model.

2. <IncomeRatio_stability_normalized><zscore><IncomeRatio_stability><Z_score_of_IncomeRatio_stability_to_identify_relative_stability>

   Reasoning: Applying a Z-score transformation to IncomeRatio_stability will normalize this feature, enabling better comparison across different data points and highlighting areas where income stability significantly deviates from the average.

3. <Industry_IncomeRatio_log_mean><log><Industry_IncomeRatio_mean><Log_transformation_of_Industry_IncomeRatio_mean_to_normalize_earning_patterns_across_sectors>

   Reasoning: Taking the logarithm of Industry_IncomeRatio_mean will reduce the effect of extreme outliers and precipitate large differences in sectoral earning patterns for better model insights.

   *Reasoning*: People with prior defaults might have specific income ratio patterns, especially when the income ratio is transformed. By interacting log-transformed income ratio with prior default, nuanced risk patterns might be captured.

3. \<Normalized_YearsEmployed\>zscore\<YearsEmployed\>\<Standardized_YearsEmployed_to_compare_across_population\>  
   *Reasoning*: Normalizing years employed could help in standardizing experience-related financial behaviors, allowing for a more straightforward comparison across individuals.

   - Reasoning: By examining the ratio of IncomeRatio to IncomeRatio_stability, we can gain insight into how stable an individual's financial situation is relative to their income-to-debt level. This can help in identifying individuals who, despite high income ratios, might be in less stable economic scenarios, potentially affecting credit card application success.

2. <YearsEmployed_Age_interaction><multiply><YearsEmployed><Age><Interaction_between_YearsEmployed_and_Age_to_identify_how_combination_of_experience_and_age_influence_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: This feature explores the interaction between years of employment and age, which could provide insights into applicants' career stability and maturation over time. It's likely that different combinations of age and employment years might affect credit behavior and success in securing a credit card.

3. <IncomeRatio_cubic_root><cube><IncomeRatio_sqrt><Cubic_transformation_of_IncomeRatio_to_assess_non_linear_relationship_with_credit_card_success>
   - Reasoning: Applying a cubic transformation to the square root of the IncomeRatio may capture non-linear patterns and subtle variations that are not highlighted with simpler transformations. This may help to better align the income-to-debt information with the credit card application outcomes, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between a person's age and their income-to-debt ratio, which can be indicative of financial behavior and potential risk. It may help identify patterns where certain age groups with specific income ratios are more likely to be successful in their credit card applications.

2. <IncomeStability_Index><divide><Industry_IncomeRatio_mean><IncomeRatio_stability><Index_of_relative_income_stability_within_industry_across_different_regions>

   Reasoning: This feature calculates the relative stability of a person's income within their industry by considering the standard deviation of income ratios across different zip codes. A lower index might suggest stable earnings relative to peers, potentially leading to successful credit card applications.

3. <Years_PriorDefault_Interaction><cross><YearsEmployed><PriorDefault><Categorical_interaction_between_years_employed_and_prior_default_status_to_highlight_experience_related_default_risk_patterns>

   Reasoning: This interaction feature can capture the risk pattern associated with people who have prior defaults but have also been employed for a certain number of years. It may help in understanding if prolonged employment mitigates the risk posed by a prior default when applying for credit.

2026-01-30 13:19:32,914 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features using the operators:

1. <Age_grouped_by_PriorDefault_mean><groupbythenmean><PriorDefault><Age><Mean_age_within_each_prior_default_group>  
   Reasoning: Group by PriorDefault and calculate the mean Age to capture any trends or patterns in age distribution based on whether or not an individual had a prior default. This can help identify specific age groups that might be more prone to defaulting based on historical data.

2. <YearsEmployed_scaled_by_Age><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><Relative_work_experience_adjusted_for_age>  
   Reasoning: Create a feature that represents the proportion of an individual's work experience relative to their age. This ratio could provide insights into the financial stability or career maturity of an individual which might affect their likelihood of successfully applying for a credit card.

3. <IncomeRatio_stability_by_zipcode_mean><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><IncomeRatio_stability><Average_income_stability_by_zipcode>  
   Reasoning: Group by ZipCode and compute the mean of IncomeRatio_stability to analyze the average income stability across different areas. This can help identify geographical patterns where certain zip codes have more financial stability, potentially affecting the success rate in credit card applications.

2026-01-30 13:20:06,953 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here's how you can create new features to potentially improve the downstream model's performance in predicting successful credit card applications:

1. <PriorDefault_Age_IncomeRatio_cross><cross><PriorDefault_Age_cross><IncomeRatio_log><Interaction_among_PriorDefault_Age_and_IncomeRatio_log_for_rich_behavior_patterns>
   - Reasoning: Creating an interaction term among prior defaults, age, and log-transformed income ratio captures complex patterns that may influence credit card application success, allowing the model to distinguish different behavior groups.

2. <IncomeRatio_stability_ZipCode_Interaction><divide><IncomeRatio_stability><ZipCode><Standardized_IncomeRatio_stability_per_ZipCode_for_local_financial_context>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing income ratio stability with respect to the ZipCode might adjust for varying local economic stability, providing better insights into financial behaviors specific to geographic areas.

3. <Experience_Age_Ratio><ratio><YearsEmployed><Age><Proportion_of_YearsEmployed_to_Age_as_Experience_Maturity_Index>
   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio of years employed to age serves as an experience maturity index, potentially highlighting an individual's professional stability and growth relative to their age, which can be a significant factor in credit card application outcomes.

These steps aim to extract more relevant insights from the existing data through interactions, normalizations, and ratios to boost the model's predictive accuracy.

2026-01-30 13:20:13,506 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's create three new features using feature engineering operations to potentially improve the downstream model's performance for predicting successful credit card applications.

1. Consideration: Age and prior default history often have a strong influence on credit decisions. Combining these two variables might better capture age-specific default risk patterns.

    - New Feature: Combining Age and PriorDefault to create a continuous feature that may capture nuanced effects.
    - Operation:
      - <Age_PriorDefault_combined><multiply><Age><PriorDefault><Combined_Age_and_PriorDefault_to_identify_risk_patterns>

2. Consideration: The financial stability within specific zip codes can provide insights regarding creditworthiness. Understanding the relative stability of income ratio in comparison to individual records might enhance predictions.

    - New Feature: Create a ratio of Individual IncomeRatio with the standard deviation of IncomeRatio across different ZipCodes for relative comparison.
    - Operation:
      - <IncomeRatio_relative_stability><ratio><IncomeRatio><IncomeRatio_stability><Relative_IncomeRatio_to_Stability_in_ZipCode_to_detect_outliers>

3. Consideration: Years employed and age individually represent experience and maturity. However, the ratio of these can provide insights about life-stage-related financial stability and creditworthiness.

    - New Feature: Creating a ratio of YearsEmployed to Age might reflect the individual's career stability and financial maturity.
    - Operation:
      - <Employment_Age_ratio><ratio><YearsEmployed><Age><Ratio_of_Years_Employed_to_Age_to_capture_career_stability>

These newly engineered features should provide richer insights and improve the ability of the model to predict successful credit card applications.

2026-01-30 13:20:19,432 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operations, aimed at improving the downstream model's performance:

1. Interaction between prior default and financial stability:
   - <PriorDefault_Stability_cross><cross><PriorDefault><IncomeRatio_stability><Interaction_between_PriorDefault_and_IncomeRatio_stability_to_capture_stability_influence_on_credit_risk>
   
   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between a prior default event and income ratio stability, which could reveal patterns where areas of financial instability might exacerbate the risk of defaults.

2. Combining age, years employed, and prior default to capture complex risk patterns:
   - <Age_YearsEmployed_PriorDefault_combined><cross><Age><YearsEmployed_Age_combined><Combined_effect_of_Age_and_YearsEmployed_on_PriorDefault_to_identify_experience_and_age_related_risk>
   
   Reasoning: By combining these three features, we can better capture any complex relationships between age, years of employment, and historical defaults, which might help in identifying nuanced risk patterns.

3. Standardizing income ratio based on industry:
   - <Standardized_Industry_IncomeRatio><groupbythenstd><Industry_IncomeRatio_mean><IncomeRatio><Standard_deviation_of_IncomeRatio_across_industries_for_normalizing_income_levels>
   
   Reasoning: This feature helps in normalizing income levels across different industries by analyzing the standard deviation of income ratios within each industry. This normalization could help in identifying which industries have more consistent earnings, potentially lowering credit risk.

2026-01-30 13:20:30,097 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, with the aim of improving the downstream model's performance:

1. Create a feature with the interaction between IncomeRatio stability and Age.
    - This feature could capture the stability of income in a specific area relative to the age profile of individuals, potentially revealing unique insights about financial behavior across different age groups and income stability.
     
    <IncomeRatioStability_Age_cross><cross><IncomeRatio_stability><Age><Interaction_between_IncomeRatio_stability_and_Age_to_capture_its_effect_on_credit_risk>
    

2. Generate a z-score normalized IncomeRatio_stability to enhance the stability measure.
    - Normalizing the IncomeRatio stability can provide a standardized measure of financial stability, allowing the model to better understand outliers and variances in different geographies.
     
    <IncomeRatio_stability_zscore><zscore><IncomeRatio_stability><Z_score_standardization_of_IncomeRatio_stability>
    

3. Create a binary feature that indicates if the IncomeRatio_log is above a certain threshold, indicating high normalized income.
    - This feature can highlight individuals with potentially high earning power when standardized, which might correlate with higher credit card acceptance rates.

   Reasoning: By capturing the combined effect of income distribution across industries and the stability measure, we might gain a better understanding of financial stability influenced by different industry income averages.

2. <Age_Square><square><Age><Square_of_Age_to_examine_if_older_applicants_have_exponential_influence_on_approval>  
   Reasoning: Squaring the age feature might help reveal any exponential effects of age on credit card approval likelihood. Older applicants might exhibit different financial behaviors, and this feature could capture those subtleties.

3. <IncomeRatio_Log_Abs><abs><IncomeRatio_log><Absolute_value_of_log_income_ratio_to_reduce_negativity_bias_and_extract_raw_amplitude_value>  
   Reasoning: Taking the absolute value of the logarithm of income ratios might help reduce any negative value biases, allowing the model to better capture the raw amplitude of income disparities despite direction, and potentially enhancing sensitivity to these variations.

2026-01-30 13:20:49,345 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps using the provided operators to improve the prediction model for credit card application success:

1. <Income_Age_Stability_cross>cross<IncomeRatio_stability><PriorDefault_Age_cross><Interaction_of_Income_Stability_and_Age_Related_to_PriorDefaults>
   - Reasoning: By crossing IncomeRatio_stability with PriorDefault_Age_cross, we can capture an interaction effect between income stability and age in the context of prior defaults. This may help to uncover patterns related to financial behavior that could be predictive of credit card application success.

2. <Normalized_Industry_IncomeRatio>zscore<Standardized_Industry_IncomeRatio><Normalization_of_Industry_Income_Ratio_using_z-score>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing the Standardized_Industry_IncomeRatio using a z-score can help normalize this feature across the dataset. This might make it easier for the downstream model to identify individuals whose industry income ratios significantly deviate from the norm, which could be a useful indicator of creditworthiness or risk.

3. <Experience_Ratio>ratio<YearsEmployed_Age_combined><Age><Ratio_of_Experience_to_Age>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of experience (through YearsEmployed_Age_combined) to Age can help determine the proportion of an individual's life spent gaining employment experience. This can indicate financial maturity or stability, which is influential in assessing credit card application success likelihood.

2026-01-30 13:20:57,634 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to improve the credit card application success prediction:

1. <IncomeRatio_log_stability_ratio><divide><IncomeRatio_log><IncomeRatio_stability><Ratio_of_log_transformed_IncomeRatio_to_IncomeRatio_stability)
   - Reasoning: By taking the ratio of the log-transformed income ratio to the stability of income ratio, we can capture the relative stability and variability in income, which might influence creditworthiness.

2. <Age_group><bin><Age><Binned_Age_groups)
   - Reasoning: Binning the Age feature will reduce the sensitivity of the model to outliers and allows it to capture the non-linear relationship between age groups and credit card application success.

3. <Combined_Economic_Factor><plus><Standardized_Industry_IncomeRatio><Industry_IncomeRatio_mean><Combined_metric_of_Industry_standardized_and_average_IncomeRatio)
   - Reasoning: By combining these two features, we can encapsulate both the industry-specific and general income characteristics, potentially providing a holistic view of the applicant’s economic factors that might affect success in applying for credit cards.

2026-01-30 13:21:02,400 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps:

1. \<PriorDefault_ZipCode_cross\><cross>\<PriorDefault\>\<ZipCode\><Interaction_between_PriorDefault_and_ZipCode_to_capture_the_effect_of_location_on_prior_default_impact>
   - Reasoning: By interacting the PriorDefault flag with the ZipCode, we can capture any geographical influence on the likelihood of prior defaults affecting credit card application success. This could reveal location-based patterns in risk.

2. \<Age_IncomeRatio_log_combined\><multiply>\<Age\>\<IncomeRatio_log\><Product_of_Age_and_IncomeRatio_log_to_capture_effect_of_earning_power_within_age_groups>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying Age by the logarithm of Income Ratio can highlight how earning potential scales with age, possibly identifying different financial behaviors or risk profiles in various age brackets. This combination could provide insight into financial maturity influenced by both age and income.

3. \<IncomeRatio_stability_zscore\><zscore>\<IncomeRatio_stability\><Z_score_of_IncomeRatio_stability_to_normalize_and_identify_extreme_areas>
   - Reasoning: Transforming IncomeRatio_stability into a z-score helps identify areas with exceptionally high or low financial stability relative to the dataset. Outliers in financial stability can significantly impact credit risk assessments, making this feature potentially predictive of successful credit card applications.

2026-01-30 13:21:06,819 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <ZipCode_binned><bin><ZipCode><Binned version of ZipCode to capture geographical impact in condensed form>
   
   Reasoning: Binning the ZipCode can help to simplify the geographical representation, likely allowing the model to identify regional patterns without being overwhelmed by the granular data.

2. <Age_IncomeRatio_Impact><multiply><Age><IncomeRatio_sqrt><Interaction between Age and square root of IncomeRatio indicating earning potential and financial impact based on age>

   Reasoning: This feature combines Age with the square root of IncomeRatio to capture the earning potential of individuals while reducing skewness. This might highlight age-related earning characteristics that could affect credit card application success.

3. <IncomeRatio_Stability_median_normalized><subtract><IncomeRatio_stability><Industry_IncomeRatio_mean><IncomeRatio stability adjusted by median industry to assess stability in income relative to industry norms>

   Reasoning: Subtracting the Industry's median IncomeRatio from individual stability scores could identify areas where individuals' stability deviates from industry averages, potentially highlighting distinct financial behaviors that influence credit risk.

   - Reasoning: Binning the ZipCode into categorical ranges might capture regional socio-economic distinctions that could impact credit card application success. This feature could help differentiate between applicants from different areas that may have varying financial behaviors.

2. \<Stability_Age_Interaction\><cross\><IncomeRatio_stability\><Age\>\<Interaction_between_IncomeRatio_stability_and_Age_to_capture_effect_of_financial_stability_across_age_groups\>
   - Reasoning: By creating an interaction term between IncomeRatio stability and Age, you can capture the impact of financial stability across different age groups, potentially highlighting cohorts that are more financially unstable or stable and how this affects their success in credit card applications.

3. \<IncomeRatio_log_zscore\><zscore\><IncomeRatio_log\><Z-score_of_IncomeRatio_log_to_standardize_and_identify_outliers_in_Incomes\>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing IncomeRatio_log using a Z-score can help identify outliers in individual income levels, which could indicate applicants with unusual income profiles that affect their credit card application outcomes. This helps to normalize data for more robust modeling.
