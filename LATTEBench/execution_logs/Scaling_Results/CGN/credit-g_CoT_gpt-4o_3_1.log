   Reasoning: This feature estimates the balance between the credit amount and the installment commitment, reflecting the burden of loan amount relative to monthly installments. It's useful to assess whether the applicant's credit amount is reasonable compared to their ability to pay monthly.

2. <employment_savings_cross><cross><employment><savings_status><Interaction_between_employment_and_savings>

   Reasoning: Combining employment length with savings status can reveal more about the applicant's financial stability. For example, a person with a longer employment period and significant savings might be seen as more trustworthy.

3. <age_duration_ratio><divide><age><duration><Ratio_of_age_to_loan_duration>

   Reasoning: This feature provides insight into how proportionate the loan duration is relative to the applicant's age. Younger applicants with longer durations may represent a different risk profile than older applicants with shorter durations.

2026-01-30 11:36:58,408 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly, let's explore some potential feature engineering steps that could enhance the predictive performance of the model for determining credit approval.

1. <age_credit_amount_interaction><multiply><age_duration_ratio><credit_amount><interaction_of_age_and_credit_amount_to_reflect_risk_level>
   - Reasoning: By interacting age_duration_ratio with credit_amount, this feature could capture potentially valuable information about the financial behavior relative to age and the amount of credit. This interaction might indicate how rapidly an older applicant is able to repay larger credits.

2. <credit_history_employment_property><cross><credit_history><employment_property_cross><cross_features_between_credit_history_and_employment_property_for_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit_history and employment_property_cross can reveal how past credit behaviors relate to their employment and property status today. This could help capture both a history of payments and current financial stability in a single feature.

3. <age_duration_log><log><age_duration_ratio><log_transform_of_age_duration_ratio_for_better_discrimination>
   - Reasoning: Applying a log transformation to age_duration_ratio can help manage skewness and potentially enhance the linearity of the relationship in relation to the credit decision. This transformation can make extreme values more manageable and increase modeling capability.

2026-01-30 11:37:03,440 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators to potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<purpose_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<purpose\>\<Encoded_numerical_representation_of_the_credit_purpose\>  
   Reasoning: Converting the categorical 'purpose' feature into a numerical representation can help the model understand the ordinal relationships and improve interpretability.

2. \<credit_age_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<age_duration_ratio\>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_age_duration_ratio_as_a_proxy_for_financial_risk\>  
   Reasoning: Creating a feature that captures the ratio of credit amount to the age-duration ratio could provide insights into the borrower's financial risk, potentially improving the model's ability to assess creditworthiness.

3. \<employment_property_score\>\<label_encode\>\<employment_property_cross\>\<Numerical_score_based_on_employment_and_property_status_combination\>  
   Reasoning: Transforming the 'employment_property_cross' categorical feature into a numerical score may simplify the model's ability to leverage this complex feature, which encodes combined information about employment stability and property ownership.

2026-01-30 11:37:10,012 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve model predictions:

1. \<age_credit_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<age_duration_ratio\>\<ratio_of_credit_amount_to_age_as_a_proxy_for_financial_risk\>  
   - Reasoning: This new feature can provide insights about the borrower's financial burden relative to their age and loan duration. A high ratio might indicate a higher financial burden, potentially relating to riskier profiles.

2. \<employment_residence_cross\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<residence_since\>\<interaction_between_employment_and_residence_to_capture_stability\>  
   - Reasoning: The combination of employment status and the length of residence can be indicative of an individual's stability. People who have worked longer and resided longer in one place might be more financially stable.

3. \<credit_risk_score\>\<plus\>\<employment_property_score\>\<credit_age_ratio\>\<aggregated_risk_score_from_employment_property_and_credit_risk\>  
   - Reasoning: By combining employment property score and credit age ratio into a single score, this feature aims to encapsulate both the financial stability (employment and property) and risk factor (credit age), which could be a strong predictor of creditworthiness.

2026-01-30 11:37:16,459 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operations to improve the downstream model's performance. The reasoning behind each step is included:

1. Purpose-Credit Amount Interaction: Understanding how different purposes interact with the credit amount could provide insights into the financial burden related to certain purposes, potentially affecting credit approval.

    
    <purpose_credit_amount_interaction><multiply><purpose_encoded><credit_amount><Interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_amount>
    

2. Credit History Influence on Employment Property Score: Exploring the relationship between a person's credit history and their employment-property status might highlight the influence of past credit behavior on current financial stability. 

    
    <credit_history_employment_property_cross_score><cross><credit_history><employment_property_cross><Intersect_credit_history_and_employment_property_status>
    

3. Normalized Age Duration Score with Financial Risk: Combining the standardized age duration ratio with the credit age ratio could help in balancing the individual's demographic profile against their financial risk profile, providing more comprehensive insight into their risk level.

    
    <normalized_financial_demographic_risk><multiply><age_duration_zscore><credit_age_ratio><Balance_age_duration_influence_with_financial_risk>
     

These feature engineering steps are designed to capture interactions and relationships within the data that are potentially relevant to the target variable, thereby possibly improving the model's predictive performance.

3. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction_between_employment_and_residence_duration_to_assess_stability_and_risk>

Explanation:

1. Interaction of credit history and purpose: By creating a feature that captures the interaction between credit history and purpose, we aim to model potential dependencies and correlations between these factors that jointly affect the likelihood of receiving credit.

2. Normalized credit amount: Applying z-score normalization to the credit amount can help control for the potential inflation effect and make the model more robust by increasing the comparability across different samples.

3. Employment and residence interaction: Employment status combined with residence duration could give further insight into the applicant's stability, helping to distinguish between individuals with uncertain versus stable financial situations.

   - Reasoning: Encoding categorical variables into numerical values can help the model learn patterns more effectively, especially if the job category has an impact on creditworthiness.

2. <checking_credit_combined_encoded><label_encode><checking_status_credit_combined><Numerical_encoding_of_combined_checking_status_and_credit_history_for_model_input>
   - Reasoning: The 'checking_status_credit_combined' is a complex feature that combines two different attributes. Encoding it numerically can allow the model to capture nuanced interactions between checking status and credit history.

3. <log_credit_age_ratio><log><credit_age_ratio><Log_transformation_of_credit_age_ratio_to_reduce_skewness_and_handle_outliers>
   - Reasoning: The 'credit_age_ratio' can be highly skewed due to its wide range. Applying a logarithmic transformation can stabilize the variance, making the model more robust to outliers and improving its ability to generalize.

   Reasoning: By multiplying the numerically encoded credit history with the employment-property score, we aim to capture a consolidated risk measure that reflects both past financial behaviors and present financial stability. This score could help improve predictions by providing a more nuanced view of financial risk.

2. \<adjusted_credit_age_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_age_ratio\>\<employment_property_score\>\<Adjusting the credit age ratio by employment-property score to account for financial stability in risk assessment\>

   Reasoning: Dividing the credit age ratio by the employment-property score helps rescale the financial risk measure by incorporating elements of employment and asset stability, potentially leading to a more accurate assessment of credit worthiness.

3. \<combined_purpose_job\>\<cross\>\<purpose_encoded\>\<job_encoded\>\<Creating a feature that encodes correlations between credit purpose and job type to reflect lifestyle factors in credit decision\>
  
   Reasoning: By crossing purpose_encoded and job_encoded, this new feature could capture the interplay between the reason for credit and the type of employment, helping to account for lifestyle or industry-related risks. This insight may be particularly valuable in applications where job instability or specific purposes correlate with default risk.

   - Reasoning: By crossing credit history with employment property information, we can capture a more nuanced view of a person's financial stability. This could be helpful to differentiate risk even among those with the same credit history or employment.

2. <age_duration_ratio_scaled><minmax><age_duration_ratio><Scaled_age_duration_ratio_between_0_and_1_to_normalize_feature_and_reduce_effect_of_outliers>
   - Reasoning: Applying min-max scaling to the age_duration_ratio can bring all values into a uniform range. This can be useful if the model is sensitive to the scale of inputs or if interactions with other features are desired.

3. <employment_residence_stability><ratio><employment_property_score><residence_since><Ratio_of_employment_property_score_to_residence_duration_indicating_combined_stability_metric>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of employment property score to residence duration may reflect long-term stability. A higher ratio might indicate stable employment and residence, potentially lowering risk from a lender's perspective.

This step will generate a new feature by squaring the age_duration_ratio. Squaring can capture potential non-linear effects of the age-to-loan-duration ratio, which might have more predictive power for determining credit approval than a simple linear relationship.

2. <credit_history_purpose_interaction><cross><credit_history><purpose><New_categorical_feature_to_capture_interaction_effects_between_credit_history_and_credit_purpose>  
By crossing credit_history and purpose, this feature will assess whether specific purposes of loans combined with credit history have differing impacts on receiving credit, thereby providing a deeper insight into potential credit risk.

3. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Log_transformed_credit_amount_to_reduce_skewness_and_handle_outliers>  
Applying a log transformation to credit_amount, this feature aims to reduce skewness and manage outliers, making the data more normally distributed. This transformation can improve the model's performance, especially if the original feature is heavily skewed.

   Reasoning: Creating a ratio between age and credit can provide additional insight into the relative financial risk based on the age of the person and their credit amount. This can help to better assess someone's likelihood of receiving credit by understanding the balance between these two factors.

2. \<employment_property_stability_factor\> \<groupbythenmean\> \<employment_residence_interaction\> \<employment_property_score\> \<Stability_factor_based_on_average_employment_property_across_employment_residence\>

   Reasoning: Averaging the employment property score by categories of employment and residence interaction may reveal patterns related to financial stability that are significant for credit decisions. It helps to create a stability metric that can be important in assessing creditworthiness.

3. \<education_retraining_indicator\> \<one_hot\> \<purpose\> \<Binary_indicator_for_education_or_retraining_purpose\>

   Reasoning: Creating a specific indicator for educational purposes (education or retraining) can help identify if the credit is being sought for self-improvement activities, which might carry different risk profiles compared to other credit purposes. This differentiation can be crucial for predictive modeling.

2026-01-30 11:39:47,460 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's explore three potential feature engineering steps:

1. <age_credit_amount_interaction><multiply><age_duration_zscore><credit_amount><Interaction_between_age_and_credit_amount_to_capture_combined_influence_on_creditworthiness>

   Reasoning: By creating an interaction term between the standardized age and the credit amount, we may capture nuanced effects of how age and credit amount work together to influence the likelihood of receiving credit. This may help to better understand the financial maturity and risk associated with different age groups and credit levels.

2. <normalized_credit_amount><zscore><credit_amount><Standardized_credit_amount_to_reduce_skewness_and_bring_values_in_same_scale>

   Reasoning: Standardizing the credit amount helps normalize its distribution, making it easier for models to learn and potentially improving the performance of algorithms sensitive to feature scales, such as neural networks or gradient-boosting models. This can also help in comparing credit amounts relative to the mean across the dataset.

3. <employment_residence_seniority_factor><cross><employment_residence_interaction><employment_property_stability_factor><Combined_employment_residence_and_property_stability_to_capture_overall_stability_factor>

   Reasoning: By crossing the interaction between employment and residence with the employment property stability factor, we aim to capture a more holistic measure of an individual's stability both in terms of employment circumstances and their residential situation. This new feature could reveal additional insights into their financial reliability and creditworthiness.

2026-01-30 11:39:56,985 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's generate new features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<credit_checking_status_combined\><cross><credit_history><checking_status><Combined_feature_to_reflect_credit_history_and_checking_status_risk>

   - Reasoning: By crossing the credit history with the checking account status, we may capture nuanced interactions between a customer's banking behavior and their credit history, providing a more comprehensive risk profile.

2. \<normalized_credit_age_ratio\><zscore><credit_age_ratio><Standardized_ratio_of_credit_amount_to_age_influence_risk>

   - Reasoning: Standardizing the credit age ratio will help normalize this feature's influence across samples, allowing for easier comparison and potentially emphasizing significant deviations that might indicate risk.

3. \<employment_property_residence_interaction\><cross><employment_property_cross><employment_residence_interaction><Enhanced_combination_of_employment_property_and_residence_for_stability_assessment>

   - Reasoning: Crossing these interactions provides a more detailed view of a customer's stability by considering the intricate relationships between employment, property, and residential duration, potentially highlighting instability or stability more clearly.

   Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to the credit amount can help reduce its skewness, bringing it closer to a normal distribution. This could potentially reveal insights and relationships that a highly skewed distribution might hide, thereby improving model performance.

2. <credit_history_impact_score><multiply><credit_history_encoded><employment_property_stability_factor><Product_of_credit_history_encoded_and_employment_property_stability_factor_as_a_new_feature_for_credit_impact_assessment>

   Reasoning: By multiplying the credit history (which reflects the risk associated with the credit behavior) with the employment property stability factor (indicating financial stability), we can generate a feature that identifies individuals who might be perceived as low risk despite certain credit history tiers, potentially improving the decision-making process in credit approvals.

3. <duration_since_stability><groupbythenmean><residence_since><employment_property_stability_factor><Mean_of_employment_property_stability_factor_within_each_duration_of_residence_period_to_identify_regional_stability_trends>

   Reasoning: By taking the mean of the employment property stability factor for each group of residence duration, we can potentially highlight regions or durations where stability appears to be consistent, which might be a significant factor in evaluating creditworthiness. This could provide insights that a standalone residence feature or stability factor might not.

2026-01-30 11:40:09,061 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Based on the data provided and the downstream task of predicting whether a person receives credit or not, here are three possible next steps for generating features using the operations to potentially improve model performance:

1. <credit_employment_property_interaction><cross><credit_history_encoded><employment_property_score><Interaction_of_credit_history_risk_and_employment_property_to_assess_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction effect between credit history risk levels and employment-property score. Individuals with stable employment and property holdings might be assessed differently for credit, even if they have riskier credit histories. This combined feature could help identify such nuances.

2. <normalized_log_credit_age_ratio><zscore><log_credit_age_ratio><Standardized_log_credit_age_ratio_to_balance_skewness_impact_on_predictions>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the logarithmic credit-age ratio reduces the effect of skewed data and allows comparison across different records. This can improve predictions by making this variable more interpretable and consistent across samples.

3. <employment_checking_status_combined><concat><employment_residence_interaction><checking_status><Concatenation_of_employment_stability_and_checking_status_to_evaluate_financial_stability_and_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By combining employment stability and checking status, this feature offers insights into a person's overall financial health, affecting their creditworthiness. A stable employment history alongside certain checking account statuses might indicate a higher likelihood of credit approval.

2026-01-30 11:40:29,145 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering aimed at improving the downstream model's performance:

1. <loan_stability_index><multiply><employment_property_stability_factor><residence_since><Aggregated_measure_of_stability_based_on_employment_property_and_residential_duration>

   *Reasoning*: By multiplying the employment_property_stability_factor and residence_since, we create an aggregated measure. This feature helps highlight customers with long-term residences and stable employment/property, potentially indicating lower credit risk.

2. <age_credit_amount_interaction><ratio><credit_amount><age_duration_zscore><Relation_between_credit_amount_and_age_standardized_as_a_risk_proxy>

   *Reasoning*: By taking the ratio of credit_amount to age_duration_zscore, we introduce a feature that captures the relative size of the credit amount concerning standardized age metrics. This may help differentiate between borrowers demanding large amounts relative to their life stage, which could be a risk factor.

3. <employment_property_credit_risk_cross><cross><employment_property_cross><credit_history_encoded><Captures_combined_effect_of_employment_property_status_and_credit_history_on_credit_risk>

   *Reasoning*: Using cross with employment_property_cross and credit_history_encoded, we can better capture complex relationships between employment/property status and credit history risk levels. This could help identify patterns among good and bad credit cases associated with employment and property situations.

These new features focus on enhancing the model's interpretability by synthesizing complex combinations of existing data points that may surface hidden relationships significant to credit approval decisions.

2026-01-30 11:40:44,416 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<checking_residence_stability_factor\>\<multiply\><checking_credit_combined_encoded><residence_since>\<Combined_score_for_checking_status_and_residence_to_assess_stability\>

   - Reasoning: By multiplying the encoded checking status and the years of residence, we can create a feature that captures the combined stability provided by both the financial history and residential stability. This feature can help assess the stability of the applicant, possibly correlating with credit approval likelihood.

2. \<age_credit_amount_interaction\>\<divide\><credit_amount><age_duration_zscore>\<Age_and_credit_amount_interaction_adjusted_by_age\>

   - Reasoning: Dividing the credit amount by the standardized age duration (age_duration_zscore) can help create a normalized measure of credit in relation to age. This can reveal how much credit risk is being taken relative to the individual's age, which might indicate an applicant's ability to handle the credit burden better with respect to their age.

3. \<employment_property_normalized_ratio\>\<zscore\><employment_property_score>\<Normalized_employment_and_property_score\>

   - Reasoning: Applying z-score to the employment and property score will allow for normalization of this feature, making it easier to compare across samples. This might help in better evaluating the relative financial stability and assets of different individuals, improving the model's ability to predict creditworthiness.

   Reasoning: By creating a ratio between employment property stability and credit age ratio, we can better capture the relationship between stability and financial risk, potentially improving our predictions of creditworthiness.

2. \<employment_history_risk_score\><multiply\><employment_property_score\><credit_history_encoded\><Combined_score_reflecting_employment_property_and_credit_history_risk_levels\>

   Reasoning: By multiplying employment property scores with encoded credit history, a new numerical feature can be created that accounts for both employment stability and credit risk, which might provide more nuanced insights into default risk.

3. \<log_credit_amount\><log\><credit_amount\><Log_transformed_credit_amount_to_reduce_skewness_and_normalize_data_distribution_for_better_model_performance\>

   Reasoning: Log-transforming the credit amount feature can help to reduce skewness in its distribution and stabilize variance, making it more suitable for linear models and potentially improving prediction accuracy.

   - This feature applies a square root transformation to the credit amount, which can help reduce skewness and manage outliers better, potentially improving the model's performance by making the data distribution more normal.

2. <age_duration_zscore_abs><abs><age_duration_zscore><Absolute_value_of_age_duration_zscore_to_capture_magnitude_of_age_and_duration>

   - This feature takes the absolute value of the age-duration z-score, emphasizing the magnitude of deviations from normal, irrespective of direction. This can help the model to focus on the strength of the feature impact rather than its direction, which might be useful for generating reliable insights in some predictive models.

3. <employment_property_score_normalized><minmax><employment_property_score><Min_max_normalization_on_employment_property_score_to_standardize_scale_across_samples>

   - Applying min-max normalization to the employment property score will standardize this feature, scaling it within a range of [0, 1]. This normalization can help in ranking and comparing samples, improving model input quality by ensuring that features are on similar scales.

Explanation:

1. credit_history_purpose_score: By creating a combined score from the interaction between credit history, purpose, and encoded credit history, we can more effectively capture the influence of past credit behaviors and intents on credit outcomes. This can help improve the model's ability to assess risk associated with certain credit purposes given past history.

2. employment_property_residence_score: This new feature combines the interaction effects of employment, property, and residence into a numerical score. It enhances the model's ability to capture individual stability by drawing on interconnected stability indicators, making it useful for credit evaluation.

3. credit_age_risk_score: The credit age ratio and its normalized version give insights into the financial risk associated with the proportion of credit amount to age duration. The combined score considers both magnitude and standardized aspects, providing a robust assessment of financial risk relative to age and loan amount.
