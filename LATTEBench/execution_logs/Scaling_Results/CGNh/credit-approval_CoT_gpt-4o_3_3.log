2026-01-31 10:38:31,922 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three proposed next steps for feature engineering to improve the predictive performance of the model:

1. <YearsAtJob><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><Proportion_of_life_spent_employed>
   - Reasoning: This feature gives an insight into how much of an individual's life has been spent working. It could help determine stability or responsibility, contributing factors to creditworthiness.
  
2. <EmployedIncomeRatio><divide><Income><Employed><Income_ratio_conditioned_on_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: Incorporating employment status into the income can help understand how an individual's employment affects their income. If someone has a high income while being marked as not employed, it could indicate independent financial means, which might translate to lower risk.

3. <PriorDefaultDebtInteraction><multiply><PriorDefault><Debt><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_debt>
   - Reasoning: This interaction feature captures a possible compounding effect of having prior defaults and current debt levels, which might provide a significant signal regarding credit risk. High debt coupled with prior defaults could be a strong predictor of credit card application rejection.

These features are expected to provide nuanced information about financial behavior and stability, which are critical when predicting credit card application success.

2026-01-31 10:38:37,574 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions, the goal is to derive features that capture the patterns relevant to credit card application success. Let's propose three feature engineering steps using the provided operators and input features.

### Feature Engineering Steps:

1. DebtEmployedInteraction: This feature will capture the interaction between debt levels and employment status, which could be indicative of financial stability and creditworthiness.
   - Reasoning: Employed individuals might manage debt differently than unemployed individuals. This interaction could help identify applicants who manage their debt responsibly while being employed, potentially improving the model's ability to predict credit card application success.
   - <DebtEmployedInteraction><multiply><Debt><Employed><Interaction_between_debt_and_employment_status>

2. NormalizedAge: Scale the age feature using min-max normalization to bring it into a range that might be more useful for capturing relevant patterns for model learning.
   - Reasoning: Age is likely to be an important factor in credit card application success, possibly due to various factors such as financial maturity and responsibility. Normalizing age could result in better model performance by ensuring this feature is on a comparable scale with others.
   - <NormalizedAge><minmax><Age><Normalized_age_feature>

3. EmploymentIndustryCross: Create a feature that combines employment status with the industry of employment. This might provide insights into which industries have a higher rate of credit card application success among employed individuals.
   - Reasoning: Certain industries might have more stable employment conditions or higher average salaries, which could affect credit card approval rates. By combining these two features, we capture potential industry-specific patterns related to employment status that could affect creditworthiness.
   - <EmploymentIndustryCross><cross><Employed><Industry><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_industry>

2026-01-31 10:38:42,059 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations. I aim to create features that could capture more complex relationships or interactions that may help improve the downstream model’s performance in predicting successful credit card applications.

### Step 1: Interaction Between CreditScore and Debt
- Reasoning: Credit score often moves inversely with debt levels—individuals with higher debt may have lower credit scores. Exploring this interaction might reveal important insights about financial behavior relevant to creditworthiness.
  
  
  <CreditScoreDebtInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><Debt><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_debt>
  

### Step 2: Employment Duration Normalization
- Reasoning: Normalizing employment duration could highlight relative employment stability across age groups, as younger applicants might have lesser years employed simply due to their age, not instability.

  
  <NormalizedYearsEmployed><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><Proportion_of_life_spent_employed>
  

### Step 3: Income and Ethnicity Interaction
- Reasoning: Capturing the interaction between income levels and ethnicity could provide insights on financial strength varying across different ethnic groups which might be important in credit decisions.

  
  <IncomeEthnicityCross><cross><Income><Ethnicity><Interaction_between_income_and_ethnicity>
  

These feature engineering steps aim to uncover deeper relationships within the data that might inform whether an individual successfully applies for a credit card. By considering interactions between key numerical and categorical features, these steps might enhance model performance by leveraging less obvious yet vital patterns.

2026-01-31 10:38:47,303 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the predictions for successful credit card applications, we aim to create features that capture interactions between existing attributes, reflect financial stability, or provide insightful transformations. Here are three potential feature engineering steps:

1. \(\textbf{<EmployedDebtToIncomeRatio><multiply><Employed><DebtToIncomeRatio><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_debt_to_income_ratio>}\)

   Reasoning: By combining the employment status with the debt-to-income ratio, this feature may capture heightened financial stability when employed individuals have low ratios, providing a stronger indication of creditworthiness.

2. \(\textbf{<PriorDefaultCreditScoreInteraction><multiply><PriorDefault><CreditScore><Interaction_between_prior_default_status_and_credit_score>}\)

   Reasoning: Understanding the interplay between prior default status and credit score can be pivotal since having a prior default but a high credit score might indicate financial recovery, thus potentially aiding in credit approval predictions.

3. \(\textbf{<IncomeAgeRatio><divide><Income><Age><Income_to_age_ratio_providing_a_measure_of_financial_prowess_relative_to_age>}\)

   Reasoning: This measure provides insight into financial capability relative to age, as younger individuals with high incomes may be perceived differently compared to older individuals, which may impact credit application success.

2026-01-31 10:38:53,315 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps for generating new features:

1. <DebtAgeRatio><divide><Debt><Age><Debt_to_age_ratio_for_indicating_debt_relative_to_life_stage>
   - Reasoning: The debt-to-age ratio provides a measure of debt relative to a person's age, which can give insight into how well individuals manage debt at different life stages. This feature could help in understanding the financial behavior of individuals in relation to their age and might correlate with credit card approval success.

2. <CreditScoreIncomeInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><Income><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_income_levels>
   - Reasoning: A person with a high credit score but low income (or vice versa) might exhibit different credit behaviors compared to someone with both high credit score and high income. This interaction can capture the combined effect of creditworthiness and income level, potentially revealing patterns valuable for credit card application success.

3. <EmployedNormalizedYearsEmployedInteraction><multiply><Employed><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_proportion_of_life_employed>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the extent to which individuals who are employed have spent a significant part of their life working. It can reflect job stability and consistency in employment history, which are often key factors in credit evaluations. This interaction could be predictive of credit card application outcomes, as stable employment history usually benefits creditworthiness.

   - *Reasoning*: Individuals with longer continuous employment relative to their age often exhibit higher financial stability, which could influence credit card approval.
   - <EmploymentStabilityScore><multiply><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Employed><Combined_measure_of_employment_duration_and_status>

2. DebtRiskFactor:

1. Empirical Debt Ratio by Industry & Employment:
   - Reasoning: By combining DebtToIncomeRatio with Industry and Employed status, we can capture the interaction between job sector, employment, and an individual's financial stability.
   - <IndustryEmploymentDebtRatio><multiply><DebtToIncomeRatio><Employed><Interaction_between_debt_to_income_ratio_and_employment_status>
   - <IndustryGroupedDebtRatio><groupbythenmean><Industry><IndustryEmploymentDebtRatio><Mean_debt_ratio_within_each_industry_conditional_on_employment>

2. Risk Score based on Credit and Prior Defaults:
   - Reasoning: An aggregate risk score derived from CreditScore, PriorDefault, and Debt can inform about an individual's financial behavior, which is crucial for credit card approval decisions.
   - <CreditDefaultDebtInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><PriorDefault><Interaction_of_credit_score_and_prior_default_status>
   - <CombinedRiskScore><multiply><CreditDefaultDebtInteraction><Debt><Aggregated_risk_score_combining_credit_score,_prior_defaults_and_debt>

3. Age Adjusted Income Stability Score:
   - Reasoning: This feature adjusts income by age and employment duration to gauge income stability and growth potential, vital for creditworthiness evaluation.
   - <IncomeNormalizedByAge><divide><Income><Age><Income_to_age_ratio_indicating_positional_stability_and_growth>
   - <StabilityScore><multiply><IncomeNormalizedByAge><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Overall_stability_score_from_income_growth,_age,_and_employment_duration>

These engineered features introduce nuanced relationships between existing features and can potentially capture underlying patterns relevant to credit card application success.

1. Feature Explanation:
   - Employing the log transformation on scaled features can stabilize the variance and make the data distribution closer to normal, which is beneficial for some models.

   plaintext
   <LogDebt><log><Debt><Log_transformation_of_scaled_debt>
   

2. Feature Explanation:
   - The interaction between credit score and whether someone has employment experience can provide insights into how financial reliability couples with employment history.

   plaintext
   <CreditExperienceScore><multiply><CreditScore><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Interaction_of_credit_score_with_employment_experience>
   

3. Feature Explanation:
   - The length of employment in combination with income could reflect financial stability over time. By normalizing years employed by income, this feature can capture the essence of how long someone has maintained income-generating employment.

2026-01-31 10:39:14,077 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed next steps for generating new features, using different operators and considering the impact on the downstream task:

1. DebtScoreWeightedRisk  
   <DebtScoreWeightedRisk><multiply><Debt><CreditExperienceScore><Weighted_risk_factor_combining_debt_with_credit_experience_score>  
   Reasoning: Combining outstanding debt with the interaction between credit score and employment experience could provide a nuanced risk assessment. The credit experience score might define how well an individual manages credit, which, when combined with debt levels, creates a composite indicator of risk that could highlight the likelihood of successful credit applications.

2. NormalizedZipIncome  
   <NormalizedZipIncome><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Income><Mean_income_normalized_by_zip_code_region>  
   Reasoning: ZipCode can be a surrogate for geographic concentration of income levels, influencing credit approval likelihood. Normalizing income by ZipCode could enable differentiation across regions with varying financial profiles, potentially aiding in detecting patterns of successful credit card applications.

3. AgeIndustryInteraction  
   <AgeIndustryInteraction><cross><Age><Industry><Interaction_between_age_and_industry_for_enhanced_predictive_insight_into_credit_card_approval>  
   Reasoning: Cross-referencing age with industry may reveal dynamics about career stages and respective industries, possibly indicating economic stability or growth potential tied to industry longevity, further informing the prediction of credit application success.

   Reasoning: Cubing the Debt, capturing more nonlinear relationships, could help better understand interactions between higher levels of Debt and life stage, which may relate to credit risk.

2. <IndustryExperienceInteraction><cross><Industry><CreditExperienceScore><Interaction_between_industry_and_credit_experience_score>
   Reasoning: The performance of credit score may be significantly influenced by the industry-specific roles or economic cycles. Creating a cross-feature can help in capturing industry-specific variations in credit experience.

3. <EmployedIncomeDifference><subtract><Income><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Potential_employment_income_vs_actual_relative_employment_duration_difference>
   Reasoning: Subtracting NormalizedYearsEmployed from Income provides a feature exploring the difference between potential employment income relative to actual employment duration, offering insight into employment stability and potential financial growth which can be critical for credit approval predictions.

   - Reasoning: Individuals with a prior default might still be approved for a credit card if they have a substantial income, indicating they have the financial capacity to manage repayments better in the future. This feature might reveal hidden interactions between default status and current financial capacity.

2. <BankCustomerIncomeNormalized><divide><Income><BankCustomer><Magnitude_of_income_relative_to_bank_customer_status_indicating_financial_management_capabilities>
   - Reasoning: The BankCustomer feature indicates whether an individual has a bank account, which is often associated with better financial management. By analyzing income relative to bank account status, we can identify if individuals without a bank account but with high income manage their finances similarly to those with accounts.

3. <DebtExperienceInteraction><multiply><Debt><CreditExperienceScore><Interaction_between_debt_and_credit_experience_score_capturing_credit_management_behavior>
   - Reasoning: A high debt level combined with a poor credit experience score may indicate poor financial management and credit behavior, potentially leading to credit application rejection. However, high credit experience combined with manageable debt levels might suggest responsible financial management. This interaction could improve prediction of successful credit applications.

   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture how income, when coupled with industry-specific risk patterns tied to prior defaults, might influence credit card approval likelihood. Different industries may yield varying credit risk interpretations, particularly when income is considered alongside industry-specific risk factors.

2. <EmploymentDebtScore><multiply><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Debt><Measure_of_financial_stability_through_employment_duration_relative_to_debt>
   - Reasoning: By evaluating the employment duration in proportion to outstanding debt, this feature provides insight into an individual's financial stability and ability to manage debt based on employment history. Stability in employment could be a strong indicator of financial liability management, impacting credit card approval.

3. <CreditIncomeDefaultCross><cross><CreditExperienceScore><Income><PriorDefault><Interaction_among_credit_experience,_income_and_prior_default_status_for_risk_assessment>
   - Reasoning: This composite feature assesses the interplay between credit experience, income, and prior default status to understand risk factors associated with credit risk better. It will help uncover complex patterns linked to previous defaults that might not be visible when examining factors in isolation.

2026-01-31 10:39:43,447 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the prediction model for credit card approval, let's explore a few feature engineering steps based on the given features. The aim is to create informative transformations that may provide better predictive power for the modeling process:

1. ProportionOfDebtToIncome<ratio><Debt><Income><Debt_relative_to_income_providing_insight_into_financial_liquidity>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of Debt to Income provides a financial liquidity metric. Individuals with low ratios might be more successful in credit applications, as it implies effective debt management capabilities compared to their income.

2. DefaultedZipPositiveIncomeCross<cross><IndustryRiskFactor><ZipCode><Interaction_between_industry_risk,_zip_code_and_prior_default_with_positive_income_to_capture_location_and_sector-specific_risk_behavior>
   - Reasoning: By capturing the interaction of the zip code with the industry-specific risk and past defaults, this feature accounts for geographical and industry-related risk patterns. Using only positive income cases can indicate regions or sectors where successful credit applications are more common.

3. AgeScaledNormalizedYearsEmployed<multiply><Age><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Age_and_proportion_of_employment_duration_as_a_measure_of_stability_over_time>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying age by the proportion of life spent employed gives a sense of how employment stability increases with the individual's age. It might be a useful feature since more mature individuals usually have more stable employment, potentially increasing creditworthiness.

   Reasoning: Interacting PriorDefault with Age can help capture how age influences the likelihood of a prior default impacting credit card approval. Younger applicants with prior defaults might differ significantly in behavior or risk compared to older applicants, especially in how they recover from financial issues.

2. <IndustryExperienceCreditScoreInteraction><cross><Industry><CreditExperienceScore><Interaction_between_industry_and_credit_experience_score_indicating_sector-specific_credit_management_behaviors>  
   Reasoning: This feature aims to capture differences in credit management practices across different industries by considering both the sector and credit experience score together. Industries might show varied patterns of credit behavior depending on the employment experience and risk within that specific sector.

3. <IncomeDebtMortgageRiskScore><multiply><IncomeDebtRatio><IndustryRiskFactor><Weighted_financial_stability_indicator_combining_income_to_debt_ratio_with_industry_and_prior_default_status>  
   Reasoning: By intertwining financial stability measures (IncomeDebtRatio) with sector risk (IndustryRiskFactor, which includes PriorDefault), we can gain insights into applicants' financial robustness and how industry-specific risks might affect their credit card approval chances. This could provide a stronger indicator of creditworthiness based on both micro (individual financial stability) and macro (industry risk patterns) factors.

   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture how an individual's credit experience interacts with their status as a bank customer, potentially providing insights into their financial management practices and their likelihood of credit card approval.

2. <DebtNormalizedByAgeRatio><divide><Debt><Age><Debt_relative_to_age_as_an_indicator_of_financial_stability_through_life_stage>
   - Reasoning: Debt adjusted by age can offer insights into how an individual's debt burden is proportionate to their age, potentially indicating their financial maturity and risk levels, which could be relevant in predicting credit card approval success.

3. <IndustryAgeCross><cross><Industry><Age><Exploration_of_industry_effects_on_financial_behavior_across_different_age_groups>
   - Reasoning: Crossing industry with age might reveal industry-specific patterns in financial behavior that vary across age groups. This could be useful for understanding demographics important for credit card application outcomes.

2026-01-31 10:40:00,271 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and operations available, below are proposed steps to generate new features aimed at improving the prediction of credit card application success in the dataset:

1. DebtAgeWeightedRiskInteraction<cube><Debt><Debt_age_interaction_enhanced_with_cubic_operation_to_capture_complex_debt_behavior_relative_to_life_stage>
   - Reasoning: Applying cubic transformation on debt may exaggerate its impact for individuals with substantial debt. It is particularly useful in unearthing non-linear relationships in debt levels that could influence credit card approval, considering life stage and maturity (age).

2. EmploymentIndustryRiskCross<cross><NormalizedYearsEmployed><IndustryRiskFactor><Cross_industry_risk_with_normalized_employment_duration_capturing_employment_stability_across_sectors>
   - Reasoning: Creating a feature depicting the cross-interaction between employment duration and industry-specific risk factor will provide a measure of how different industries influence employment stability linked to credit card approval. Sectors with perceived higher risk may see the influence of employment stability moderated differently.

3. PriorDefaultIncomeDebtScoreInteraction<multiply><PriorDefault><IncomeDebtRatio><Interaction_between_prior_default_status_and_income_to_debt_ratio_capturing_financial_risk_patterns>
   - Reasoning: By recognizing the interplay between having a prior default and the income-to-debt ratio, this feature can, more accurately, reveal financial risk. The interaction helps in understanding how the history of defaults and current liquidity might affect credit card application outcomes.

These transformations are proposed to unearth more nuanced insights into user behaviors and financial health, which potentially influence credit card approval chances. The chosen operations aim to capture complex relationships in the data that might not be evident with linear features, offering a better model prediction performance.

   - Reasoning: The log transformation of debt reduces skewness and handles extreme variations. Combined with NormalizedYearsEmployed, this feature measures stability considering both debt management and steady employment duration, which are crucial in credit assessment.

2. <AgeIncomeRatio><divide><Income><Age><Income_relative_to_age_providing_a_measure_of_financial_growth_potential>
   - Reasoning: This feature assesses financial growth potential by comparing income to age, indicating whether an individual's earning power is appropriate for their life stage, which is often considered by credit card approval strategies.

3. <IndustryEmploymentRisk><cross><Industry><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Interaction_between_industry_and_proportion_of_life_spent_employed_capturing_sector-specific_employment_stability>
   - Reasoning: Industries inherently come with different risk factors, and the proportion of life spent employed is indicative of stability. This cross feature captures sector-specific employment stability, which might impact credit-worthiness, yielding insights into industry-specific patterns.

2026-01-31 10:40:18,916 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features that could potentially improve credit card application prediction models:

1. The CreditExperienceScore represents a key interaction between credit score and employment experience, while Income itself can be indicative of the financial capability to handle credit liabilities. A feature combining these elements could enhance model predictions by capturing the financial stability and credit management capacity.
   - <CreditExperienceIncomeInteraction><multiply><CreditExperienceScore><Income><Interaction_between_credit_experience_score_and_income_indicating_financial_stability_and_credit_management_capability>

2. One heuristic for understanding a person’s ability to manage debt is looking at normalized debt ratios to age, which can provide insight on the financial responsibility across different life stages. Combining Debt, Age, and YearsEmployed can capture both lifecycle and employment effects on debt management.
   - <DebtAgeNormalizedYearsEmployedInteraction><ratio><Debt><multiply><Age><YearsEmployed><Debt_relative_to_age_and_employment_duration_capturing_financial_responsibility_through_lifecycle_stages>

3. Evaluating income stability within industry specific contexts could uncover patterns specific to job sectors. By correlating Industry with IncomeDebtRatio, we could enhance the predictive capability through capturing sector-specific financial and risk profiles.

1. Proportion_of_life_spent_as_a_bank_customer
   - <NormalizedBankCustomerYears><divide><YearsEmployed><BankCustomer><Proportion_of_life_spent_as_a_bank_customer>
   - This feature captures how being a bank customer relates to the overall employment duration, which may indicate stable financial habits. Those with longer employment periods relative to their time as a bank customer may indicate financial stability.

2. Interaction_of_age_with_prior_default
   - <AgePriorDefaultInteraction><multiply><Age><PriorDefault><Interaction_of_age_with_prior_default_status_capturing_age-related_risk_behavior>
   - This feature examines how age interacts with prior default status. It may capture generational differences in financial behavior where older applicants with prior defaults present different risk patterns compared to younger applicants.

3. Industry-specific_income_stability
   - <IndustryIncomeStability><cross><Industry><Income><Interaction_between_industry_and_income_to_indicate_financial_stability_within_sectors>
   - This feature explores the relationship between industry type and income to assess sector-specific income stability.

   - Reasoning: Prior default status may influence the perceived risk associated with outstanding debt. Using the log-transformed debt helps to scale the feature appropriately, capturing a nuanced relationship between previous defaults and debt levels. This interaction can better indicate creditworthiness or risk than considering these features separately.

2. <AgeNormalizedIndustryRisk><cross><NormalizedYearsEmployed><IndustryRiskFactor><Interaction_between_normalized_years_employed_and_industry_risk_factor_to_capture_sector-specific_employment_stability>
   - Reasoning: Combining employment duration relative to life with industry-specific risk factors can reveal insights into sector-specific employment stability. This can help gauge the likelihood of future employment and default possibilities, based on the stability of the industry and employment duration.

3. <IncomeDebtAgeInteraction><multiply><IncomeDebtRatio><Age><Interaction_of_income_to_debt_ratio_adjusted_by_age_to_measure_financial_stability_relative_to_life_stage>
   - Reasoning: The relationship between income, debt, and age can be used to assess financial stability across different life stages. This feature might capture dynamic financial behavior influenced by maturity, spending patterns, and earning potential related to age, providing a better understanding of risk in credit card applications.

   Reasoning: Combining the debt level with bank customer status can help understand whether having a bank account influences how debt is managed, potentially uncovering patterns that indicate success in credit card applications.

2. <IndustryIncomeNormalized><groupbythenmean><Industry><Income><Mean_income_normalized_by_industry_to_identify_sector-specific_financial_profiles>

   Reasoning: By calculating the mean income within each industry, we can capture sector-specific financial profiles that may influence credit card approval success, as different industries have varying levels of income stability and growth.

3. <PriorDefaultAgeInteractionAdjusted><cross><PriorDefault><Age><Interaction_between_prior_default_status_and_age_to_identify_age-related_financial_risk_in_profiles>

   Reasoning: The interaction between prior default status and age could reveal age-related differences in financial risk behavior, which could be a critical factor in predicting credit card approval success. Adjusting by age provides a refined approach to assessing risk profiles.

2026-01-31 10:40:40,720 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly, here's a set of three potential feature engineering steps to potentially augment the downstream model's performance for predicting credit card application success.

1. Enhancing Financial Stability Insight via Debt and Age Interaction:
   - <DebtAgeAdjustedStability><divide><Debt><Age><Debt_to_age_ratio_as_an_indicator_of_financial_stability_given_life_stage>
     - Reasoning: This ratio provides a perspective on financial burden relative to an individual's age, which can help measure how manageable the debt is at a particular lifecycle stage. This could be a key factor in assessing their creditworthiness for a credit card application.

2. Capturing Sector-Specific Financial Behavior:
   - <IndustryCreditScoreInteraction><cross><Industry><CreditExperienceScore><Interaction_between_industry_and_credit_experience_score_indicating_sector-specific_credit_management_behavior>
     - Reasoning: Industries may exhibit distinct credit management behaviors. By examining the interaction between industry type and credit experience score, it helps in understanding the sector-specific risk and management traits that might influence credit card success.

3. Evaluating Employment Relative Financial Stability:
   - <EmploymentDebtStability><multiply><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Debt><Combined_measure_of_employment_duration_relative_to_debt_for_assessing_financial_stability>
     - Reasoning: This feature assesses how employment duration correlates with financial debt. A longer employment history might imply greater stability and capacity to manage and repay debts, thereby influencing the approval decision of a credit card application. 

These engineered features focus on providing deeper insights into an individual's financial behavior, taking into account their lifecycle, sector-specific traits, and employment history, which could improve the accuracy of predictions for successful credit card applications.

   - Reasoning: Combining prior default status with the income-to-debt ratio may highlight financial risk patterns associated with individuals who have defaulted before. This interaction might reveal insights into how financial stability or instability influences credit card approval chances for people with prior defaults.

2. <AgeEmploymentEffectivenessScore><multiply><Age><EmploymentIncomeRatio><Interaction_of_age_with_years_of_employment_relative_to_income_capturing_effectiveness_of_employment_across_different_lifecycle_stages>
   - Reasoning: By interacting age with the employment-to-income ratio, this feature may help capture how effectively individuals of different ages utilize their employment durations to generate income, highlighting potential stability and financial capability influencing credit card approval.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreAdjustedRisk><cross><IndustryRiskFactor><CreditExperienceScore><Cross_interaction_of_industry-specific_risk_patterns_with_credit_experience_score_for_sector-specific_financial_risk_profiles>
   - Reasoning: Creating interaction between industry risk factors and credit experience scores can enhance the ability to predict credit card approval by capturing sector-specific credit management behaviors and risk profiles based on both the industry and individual credit histories.

2026-01-31 10:40:53,964 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating features using the provided operators and features. These steps aim to improve the downstream model's performance by capturing different aspects of credit card application success:

1. Interaction of Normalized Years Employed and Industry Risk Factor:
   - <EmploymentSectorStabilityScore><cross><NormalizedYearsEmployed><IndustryRiskFactor><Combining_proportion_of_life_spent_employed_with_industry_risk_factor_to_capture_sector-specific_employment_stability>

   *Reasoning*: By interacting the normalized years employed with the industry-specific risk factor, we aim to capture nuanced variations in employment stability across different sectors, which could be critical in predicting credit card application success.

2. Combined Risk Indicator using Debt and Prior Default:
   - <DebtPriorDefaultCombinedRisk><multiply><Debt><PriorDefault><Combining_debt_amount_with_prior_default_status_to_formulate_a_risk_indicator>

   *Reasoning*: Multiplying debt and prior default status will provide a strong indicator of financial risk, essential in assessing the likelihood of credit application approval. The presence of defaults and the magnitude of existing debts are significant factors.

3. Age-Adjusted Income Stability:
   - <AgeAdjustedIncomeStability><divide><Income><Age><Income_ratio_adjusted_by_age_as_a_means_of_assessing_financial_stability_relative_to_life_stage>

   *Reasoning*: By adjusting income by age, this feature provides a measure of financial stability and potential growth over different life stages. Young individuals with higher adjusted income may be more stable and hence more likely to succeed in their credit card applications.

Reasoning: This feature looks at how employed a person is relative to their debt and income levels, potentially highlighting those with stable financial behavior that could lead to credit card approval.

2. <AgeIndustryStability><cross><Age><IndustryRiskFactor><Interaction_between_age_and_industry_specific_risk_patterns_to_capture_more_detailed_stability_and_risk>

Reasoning: By examining the interaction between age and industry-specific risk, we can get a better picture of how age might influence or mitigate sector-specific risk patterns and how this influences credit card approval decisions.

3. <RiskAdjustedCreditExperience><multiply><CreditExperienceScore><IndustryRiskFactor><Capture_of_credit_experience_score_adjusted_by_industry-specific_risk_patterns_to_indicate_risk_profile>

Reasoning: This feature is meant to uncover how credit experience scores depend on industry risk factors, which might indicate certain risk-adjusted credit behaviors influencing credit card applications.

2026-01-31 10:41:03,281 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operations, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <IncomeAgeWeightedRisk><multiply><Income><Age><Weighted_risk_factor_combining_income_with_age_to_assess_financial_stability_across_lifecycle_stages>
   - Reasoning: Combining income with age can provide insights into financial growth potential and lifestyle stability, which could be critical for credit card approval predictions. Age-adjusted income can serve as an indication of a person's ability to manage and predict future financial obligations.

2. <IndustryCreditExperienceCross><cross><Industry><CreditExperienceScore><Interaction_between_industry_and_credit_experience_score_to_capture_sector-specific_credit_management_behaviors>
   - Reasoning: Cross-referencing industry with credit experience score may uncover patterns specific to sectors where credit management behaviors are strong predictors of successful credit card application outcomes. This can help differentiate between applicants from different sectors more effectively.

3. <EmploymentDebtInteraction><cube><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Debt><Enhanced_debt_by_cubing_employment_duration_interaction_to_capture_complex_financial_stability_and_employment_commitment>
   - Reasoning: Cubing the interaction between years employed and debt may amplify the importance of employment stability in managing debts, which is crucial for the credit card approval process. This captures not only the proportion of life employed but how this interacts significantly with debt levels in predicting application success.

2026-01-31 10:41:08,193 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible steps for feature engineering to enhance the predictive performance of the credit card application model:

1. DebtAgeInteraction: 
   This feature captures the relationship between debt and age, providing insights into financial behavior relative to life stage.
   
   <DebtAgeInteraction><multiply><Debt><Age><Interaction_between_debt_amount_and_age_to_capture_financial_behavior_relative_to_lifecycle_stage>
   

2. CreditExperienceIncomeStability:
   Combining CreditExperienceScore with Income to capture an individual's credit management behavior in relation to their financial stability and liquidity.
   
   <CreditExperienceIncomeStability><multiply><CreditExperienceScore><Income><Interaction_between_credit_experience_score_and_income_level_indicating_credit_management_behavior_and_financial_stability>
   

3. IndustryIncomeRisk:
   This feature considers industry effects on financial stability by exploring the cross-interaction between industry type and income level, which can help identify sector-specific financial risk profiles.
   
   <IndustryIncomeRisk><cross><Industry><Income><Interaction_of_job_sector_with_income_level_to_identify_sector-specific_financial_risk_profiles>
   

### Reasoning
1. DebtAgeInteraction: Using age in conjunction with debt can provide insight into how individuals manage debt as they progress through various life stages, which can correlate with creditworthiness.

2. CreditExperienceIncomeStability: Individuals with high credit scores and income likely exhibit better credit behavior and financial stability. This interaction can also highlight how effectively individuals manage their finances.

3. IndustryIncomeRisk: Different industries influence income stability and financial behavior due to job security or economic conditions. Understanding industry-specific effects can help improve sector-based risk prediction in credit assessments.

Reasoning: The financial behavior or success in credit card applications might vary based on the combination of someone's age and bank account ownership. Older individuals with bank accounts might display higher financial stability compared to younger individuals without them.

---

2. <IndustryNormalizedIncome><groupbythenmean><Industry><IncomeNormalized><Mean_income_normalized_by_industry_to_capture_sector-specific_financial_profiles_indicating_income_stability>

Reasoning: The mean normalized income for each industry could capture financial stability differences across job sectors, as individuals in some industries might have consistently higher or lower normalized incomes, affecting their creditworthiness.

---

3. <DebtScoreRiskFactor><multiply><LogDebt><CreditExperienceScore><Interaction_between_log_transformed_debt_and_credit_experience_score_to_indicate_risk_behavior_and_credit_management_stability>

Reasoning: Combining log-transformed debt and credit experience score can provide insights into how effectively individuals manage debt alongside their credit history. Larger values may indicate higher risk due to mismanagement of both credit history and debt.

2026-01-31 10:41:24,415 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps to generate features. The reasoning behind these choices is based on enhancing model performance by leveraging interactions, transformations, and aggregations that could potentially capture hidden patterns and provide useful information for predicting credit card approval.

1.  

<AgeNormalizedYearsEmployedRatio><divide><NormalizedYearsEmployed><Age><Ratio_of_normalized_years_employed_relative_to_age_for_identifying_employment_stability_patterns_across_lifecycle_stages>

Reasoning: NormalizedYearsEmployed already indicates the proportion of life spent employed, but dividing it further by Age can reflect employment stability according to the life stage. For example, younger applicants who spent more of their life employed might demonstrate a certain stability compared to older applicants.

2.  

<IndustryIncomeAverage><groupbythenmean><Industry><Income><Average_income_based_on_industry_to_capture_sector-specific_earning_potential>

Reasoning: Capturing the average income by industry provides a reference point for understanding whether a person's income is high or low relative to their peers in the same industry. This may indicate financial stability and improve creditworthiness predictions.

3.  

<DebtIncomeAgeWeightedRisk><multiply><IncomeDebtRatio><Age><Income_to_debt_ratio_weighted_by_age_to_identify_financial_stability_across_different_lifecycle_stages>

Reasoning: Combining IncomeDebtRatio with Age provides a weighted measure of financial stability that adjusts for a person's stage in life. For example, older applicants with a lower ratio may suggest better financial management compared to younger applicants with a similar ratio.

2026-01-31 10:41:30,411 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operations and dataset context:

---

1. <CreditDebtRiskInteraction><multiply><CreditExperienceScore><LogDebt><Interaction_of_credit_experience_score_with_log_transformed_debt_to_indicate_risk_behavior>  
   Reasoning: This feature combines credit experience with log-transformed debt to capture interactions related to credit management behavior and debt risk. LogDebt adjusts the scaling effects of debt, while CreditExperienceScore reflects historical credit experience. The combination provides a nuanced risk indicator.

---

2. <IndustryIncomeMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><Income><Mean_income_per_industry_to_capture_sector-specific_earning_behavior>  
   Reasoning: By aggregating income within each industry, the feature highlights differences in earning potential across job sectors. This could serve as a backdrop for evaluating financial stability in credit card applications, providing insights into sector-specific financial health.

---

3. <AgeIndustryCrossInteraction><cross><Age><IndustryRiskFactor><Interaction_between_age_and_industry_risk_factor_capturing_age-related_sector-specific_behaviors>  
   Reasoning: Interacting Age with IndustryRiskFactor connects lifecycle behaviors with sector-specific risk. Younger individuals might demonstrate different financial practices in higher-risk industries compared to older individuals, making this feature useful for predicting successful credit card applications.

---

These steps aim to reflect meaningful relationships in the data while ensuring variability and explanatory power for improving downstream tasks like credit card application success prediction.
