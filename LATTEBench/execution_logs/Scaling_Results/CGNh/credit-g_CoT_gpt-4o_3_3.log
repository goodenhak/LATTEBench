   Reasoning: Converting the categorical 'savings_status' into a numerical format can provide additional insights when combined with other numerical features. This transformation will enable mathematical operations and potentially reveal linear relationships between savings status and creditworthiness.

2. <checking_credit_history_cross><cross><checking_status><credit_history><Capture interactions between checking account status and credit history to assess the combined impact of financial liquidity and past credit behavior on creditworthiness.>

   Reasoning: Creating a new feature by crossing 'checking_status' and 'credit_history' could reveal interesting patterns in financial behavior. For example, a combination of low checking status and poor credit history might be indicative of higher risk, while high checking status combined with good credit history could reflect greater creditworthiness.

3. <age_installment_ratio><ratio><age_bin><installment_commitment><Calculate the ratio between age group and installment commitment to understand how different age segments manage their installment commitments, reflecting financial behavior patterns related to age.>

   Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the relationship between age and financial responsibility in managing installment commitments. Different age segments might have differing capabilities and commitments towards paying installments, which could provide insights into credit risk and repayment behavior.

   Reasoning: Capturing interactions between savings status and loan duration can provide insights into how consumers' savings behavior correlates with their credit needs and repayment plans. This may highlight whether individuals with better savings status tend to seek longer or shorter credit durations, helping to identify patterns of financial prudence or constraints.

2. <foreign_worker_duration_ratio><ratio><duration><residence_since><Examine the relationship between loan duration and years of residence to understand the stability of borrowers, especially for foreign workers, potentially indicating long-term planning or transitioning financial behavior.>

   Reasoning: By analyzing the ratio between loan duration and years of residence, especially for foreign workers, we can gain insight into the financial stability and planning of borrowers. This feature may help identify patterns where longer residence durations correlate with more stable or favorable credit terms.

3. <credit_foreign_savings_cross><cross><credit_history><foreign_worker_savings_interaction><Capture combined interactions between credit history and the joint influence of foreign worker status with savings account status to assess multi-layered financial stability and creditworthiness patterns.>

   Reasoning: Combining credit history with interactions between foreign worker status and savings circumstances can create a multi-dimensional view of financial stability. This feature is designed to identify complex, layered patterns related to risk and rely on interactions that involve cross-sectional financial behaviors, specifically for foreign workers.

2026-01-30 15:42:19,145 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <savings_residence_ratio><ratio><savings_status><residence_since><Calculate the ratio between savings account status and years of residence to enhance understanding of long-term financial stability, potentially identifying financially stable individuals who manage long-term commitments well.>

   Reasoning: Analyzing how savings relate to the duration of residence can provide insights into the borrower's financial stability and long-term planning capabilities. A stable financial environment may be a positive indicator for creditworthiness.

2. <credit_foreign_credit_cross><cross><credit_amount_log><foreign_worker_credit_cross><Capture interactions between the log-transformed credit amount and the foreign worker-credited cross to evaluate the combined influence of credit amount and foreign work status on credit repayment behaviors, potentially highlighting distinct risk patterns.>

   Reasoning: This interaction may reveal how different credit amounts, when combined with the nuanced behavior of foreign workers as observed in past credits, influence loan repayment performance, providing improved risk assessment.

3. <checking_foreign_interaction><cross><checking_status><foreign_worker><Capture interactions between checking account status and foreign worker status to assess their combined impact on financial liquidity and reliability, potentially identifying variations in creditworthiness due to foreign residency status.>

   Reasoning: Combining checking account status with foreign worker status could indicate differences in financial management between foreign and local residents, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of credit risk that isn't captured by each feature individually.

   *Reasoning*: Understanding how credit history interacts with foreign worker status could reveal unique risks or advantages faced by foreign workers, guiding the model to adjust credit predictions based on this demographic nuance.

2. <age_installment_ratio><ratio><age_bin><installment_commitment><Calculate the ratio between age groups and installment commitment to assess financial pressure relative to age, potentially highlighting age-specific risk tolerance and repayment capability.>

   *Reasoning*: A ratio between age and installment commitment could identify how different age groups manage financial commitments, offering the model insights into age-related risk tolerance that could refine credit approval decisions.

3. <checking_residence_cross><cross><checking_status><residence_since><Capture interactions between checking account status and years of residence to evaluate financial stability and commitment, potentially signaling creditworthiness through lifestyle consistency and financial liquidity.>

   *Reasoning*: By crossing checking account status with years of residence, we can assess the stability and liquidity of individuals, potentially highlighting reliable borrowers who combine financial accounts effectively with stable living situations.
