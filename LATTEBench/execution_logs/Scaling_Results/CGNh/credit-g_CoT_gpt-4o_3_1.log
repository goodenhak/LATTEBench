2026-01-30 15:33:07,370 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps to generate new features aimed at improving the downstream model's performance:

1. \<credit_duration_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<duration\>\<Ratio of credit amount to duration, indicating credit intensity over time\>

   Reasoning: This feature represents the intensity of credit usage over the loan duration. A higher ratio might indicate a more significant financial commitment compared to the loan duration, potentially affecting creditworthiness.

2. \<savings_credit_combination\>\<cross\>\<savings_status\>\<credit_history\>\<Interaction between savings status and credit history, predicting credit risk\>
   
   Reasoning: The combination of an individual's savings status and their credit history could provide critical insights into their financial stability and risk profile. Different pairs could indicate various degrees of risk.

3. \<job_duration_dependency\>\<cross\>\<job\>\<employment_duration_category\>\<Interaction between job type and employment duration category\>

   Reasoning: Different job types combined with varying durations of employment can signal financial stability and reliability. This feature can help distinguish risk levels based on job security and experience.

2026-01-30 15:33:20,264 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. <credit_purpose_job_interaction><cross><purpose><job><Interaction_between_purpose_and_job_type_to_assess_creditworthiness_based_on_purpose_and_employment_type>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture variations in creditworthiness that can be attributed to different job types and credit purposes. Certain job types combined with specific credit purposes might indicate higher stability or responsibility, which can be predictive of credit approval.

2. <credit_amount_weighted_duration><multiply><credit_amount><duration><Weighted_credit_amount_based_on_duration>
   - Reasoning: By multiplying the credit amount by duration, we capture the significance of the credit amount over time. This feature can reflect the total financial commitment required and help model the user's ability to manage long-term financial obligations.

3. <credit_duration_savings_status_interaction><cross><duration><savings_status><Interaction_between_credit_duration_and_savings_status_to_assess_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: This feature will provide insight into how the duration of the credit relates to the individual's savings status. A long credit duration with low savings might indicate financial overextension, while a short duration with high savings might suggest good financial health. This interaction can be valuable for predicting credit decisions.

2026-01-30 15:33:27,331 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for generating features, aimed at improving the downstream model's performance by exploring relationships and transformations that could reveal additional insights:

1. Combine Credit History and Other Payment Plans  
   <credit_history_payment_plan_interaction><cross><credit_history><other_payment_plans><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_other_payment_plans_to_assess_overall_credit_management_strategy>

   Reasoning: By combining credit history with other payment plans, we can gauge an applicant’s strategy towards handling debt. For instance, if a person with a critical credit history has additional installment plans with stores, it might indicate higher financial risk, compared to someone with all paid credit history without additional plans.

2. Normalize Credit Amount using Existing Credits  
   <normalized_credit_amount><divide><credit_amount><existing_credits><Normalize_credit_amount_by_existing_credits_to_assess_per_credit_burden>

   Reasoning: Normalizing credit amount by the number of existing credits can provide insight into the per-credit burden of the applicant. A lower value might indicate a more manageable debt situation per credit line, which can be a positive indicator of credit worthiness.

3. Create a Duration Intensity Score  
   <duration_intensity><zscore><duration><Create_a_standardized_duration_score_to_evaluate_duration_intensity>

   Reasoning: Standardizing the duration through a z-score can help identify outliers with unusually long or short credit durations compared to the average. This can highlight potential concerns or advantages in credit repayment behavior, providing a clearer view of an applicant's commitment level over time.

These steps explore different perspectives of credit behavior, by crossing categorical data to uncover potential risk patterns, normalizing data to evaluate financial commitments, and standardizing durations to identify unusual credit terms.

2026-01-30 15:33:36,534 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure! Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operations:

1. \<combined_savings_credit_status\><cross>\<savings_status\>\<credit_history\>\<Interaction_between_savings_status_and_credit_history_to_assess_financial_health\>

   Reasoning: By combining the savings status and credit history, we can better evaluate a person's overall financial health and reliability for credit repayment. This feature might uncover correlations between past credit behaviors and current savings which could influence credit approval.

2. \<credit_amount_existing_credits_weighted\><divide>\<credit_amount\>\<existing_credits\>\<Weighted_credit_amount_based_on_existing_credits_to_evaluate_credit_burden\>

   Reasoning: This feature will assess the credit burden per existing credit, which might be useful in understanding the financial strain imposed by additional credit responsibilities. It is based on the assumption that the burden may be higher when multiple credits are present.

3. \<credit_history_employment_category_interaction\><cross>\<credit_history\>\<employment_duration_category\>\<Explore_the_relationship_between_credit_history_and_employment_duration_category\>

   Reasoning: By exploring the interaction of credit history with employment duration category, we can extract insights into how employment stability might correlate with credit behavior. For example, longer employment may be indicative of a more stable economic situation, thus positively affecting credit decisions.

These features aim to improve the predictive power of the model by uncovering potential relationships between financial situations, credit behaviors, and employment stability.

   Reasoning: This feature assesses the credit burden in terms of duration relative to how many dependents there are, providing insight into an applicant's financial management capability regarding family obligations. This feature could help evaluate the individual's capacity to manage long-term financial commitments while supporting dependents.

2. <credit_purpose_skill_interaction><cross><purpose><job_credit_dependency><Determine creditworthiness based on the interaction between the credit purpose and the interaction of job type and dependents>

   Reasoning: By examining how the purpose of credit interacts with a combination of job type and number of dependents, this feature can reveal patterns of creditworthiness. Different job types and responsibilities can have varying implications on an individual's ability to manage additional credit, depending on the purpose.

3. <credit_savings_risk_interaction><cross><credit_history><savings_status><Assess_financial_risk_by_combining_credit_history_and_savings_status_information>

   Reasoning: Combining credit history with savings status can capture an individual's financial discipline and risk factor. If someone has a strong credit history and healthy savings, they may be deemed lower risk, while poor credit history and little to no savings might indicate higher fragility in financial health. This feature might improve risk assessment and loan approval decisions.

2026-01-30 15:34:02,224 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature generation:

1. <interaction_savings_payment_plan><cross><savings_status><other_payment_plans><Assess_financial_management_by_combining_savings_status_and_other_payment_plans>
   - Reasoning: The combination of savings status with other payment plans could indicate a person's financial management strategy. Having savings along with certain payment plans might signal better credit management, impacting creditworthiness.

2. <normalized_credit_checking_status><label_encode><checking_status><Assign_a_numerical_score_based_on_checking_account_status>
   - Reasoning: By converting the checking account status into numerical scores, we can quantitatively represent the influence of various checking account statuses on credit decisions. This could provide a clearer signal of financial health.

3. <credit_existing_credits_interaction><cross><credit_amount><existing_credits><Evaluate_financial_commitment_by_combining_credit_amount_with_existing_credits>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit amount with the number of existing credits can provide insights into the credit burden carried by an individual. This interaction may help assess whether the applicant is over-leveraged, affecting their likelihood of receiving additional credit.

1. <credit_amount_scaled><minmax><credit_amount><Scale credit amount using min-max scaling for normalization>
   Reasoning: Min-max scaling will normalize the credit amount, bringing it to a common scale to improve the model’s performance, especially when using algorithms sensitive to feature scale.

2. <employment_job_interaction><cross><employment_duration_category><job><Interaction between employment duration and type of job to assess career stability and financial reliability>
   Reasoning: Combining employment duration with job type can give insights into the stability of the applicant's career, which helps in assessing their financial reliability and improving prediction accuracy.

3. <savings_dependents_ratio><ratio><savings_status><num_dependents><Evaluate the financial burden of savings adjusted by the number of dependents>
   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio between savings status and the number of dependents can provide an understanding of how the savings might be distributed among dependents, thus reflecting financial support capacity.

2026-01-30 15:34:22,124 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating additional features:

1. <credit_savings_relief_score><cross><savings_status><credit_amount><Evaluate_the_level_of_financial_relief_from_savings_in_relation_to_credit_amount>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the savings status with the credit amount to assess how well the savings can potentially cover the credit demand, thereby providing insight into the applicant's financial buffer.

2. <duration_dependents_ratio><ratio><duration><job_credit_dependency><Calculate_the_ratio_of_credit_duration_to_job_type/dependents_interaction_to_assess_duration_burden_per_job_dependents>
   - Reasoning: By evaluating the ratio of credit duration to a combined measure of job type and dependents, we can gain insights into how the credit duration is spread concerning the applicant's job responsibility and number of dependents, which may impact credit risk assessment.

3. <employment_payment_plan_resilience><cross><employment_credit_history_interaction><other_payment_plans><Assess_resilience_against_financial_strain_by_combining_employment_credit_history_with_payment_plans>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the employment credit history with information about other payment plans to evaluate how well the applicant might manage financial obligations based on their employment record and additional payment commitments.

2026-01-30 15:34:28,565 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance in predicting whether a person receives credit, we can generate new features by considering interactions and transformations that capture deeper relationships and traits within the data. Here are three possible next steps using the available operators:

1. Feature Name: \<credit_duration_intensity\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<duration\>\<Evaluate the intensity of credit issuance by the ratio of the credit amount to the duration>
   - Reasoning: This feature measures the intensity of credit issued over time, which can reflect the urgency or risk associated with the credit. A higher ratio might indicate higher monthly payments relative to loan duration, capturing financial strain.

2. Feature Name: \<employment_history_stability\>\<cross\>\<employment_payment_plan_resilience\>\<credit_history\>\<Assess the overall financial stability combining employment stability and credit history>
   - Reasoning: Combining employment resilience assessment and credit history might capture the reliability and risk behavior of applicants more thoroughly. A stable employment history combined with a clean credit history could predict better creditworthiness.

3. Feature Name: \<savings_checking_combination\>\<cross\>\<savings_status\>\<checking_status\>\<Evaluate overall financial health by combining savings and checking account status>
   - Reasoning: This feature will create interactions between savings status and checking account status to provide a comprehensive view of the financial health and cash flow flexibility of the applicant, possibly influencing credit approval decisions.

Reasoning: Combining employment payment plan resilience with employment duration could better assess the individual's ability to handle financial strain, potentially improving credit prediction.

2. <credit_health_score><cross><credit_history><checking_savings_interaction><Evaluate_financial_health_by_combining_credit_history_and_interaction_between_checking/savings_account>

Reasoning: Combining credit history with the interaction between checking/savings account status may provide a more comprehensive picture of financial health, which can be critical for assessing creditworthiness.

3. <purpose_dependency_ratio><ratio><employment_payment_plan_resilience><credit_purpose_enhanced><Assess_dependency_of_credit_purpose_on_employment_payment_plan_resilience>

Reasoning: Evaluating the dependency of the credit purpose on employment payment plan resilience could uncover critical associations and improve purpose-driven credit predictions.

2026-01-30 15:34:37,935 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating new features can significantly improve the performance of predictive models by capturing underlying patterns and interactions present in the data. Here are three possible next steps using the given operators:

1. <extended_credit_purpose_interaction><cross><credit_amount><purpose><Capture the interaction between credit amount and purpose to enhance purpose-driven credit predictions>  
   - Reasoning: Understanding how credit amount relates to the specified purpose might reveal patterns in credit allocation that could influence credit predictions. This feature can help the model differentiate between high-value and low-value credit purposes and how they correlate with the credit amount, thereby refining credit eligibility assessments.

2. <employment_credit_history_risk_score><cross><employment_payment_plan_resilience><credit_history><Evaluate the risk score by combining employment stability with credit history status>  
   - Reasoning: Combining employment stability with credit history can provide insights into the applicant's financial behavior and risk level. The feature aims to improve predictions by assessing how employment resilience interacts with prior credit history, offering a more holistic view of the applicant's financial reliability.

3. <financial_account_health_combination><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Analyze the combined financial health by evaluating checking and savings account status>  
   - Reasoning: Assessing the interaction between checking and savings accounts can give a clearer indication of financial health. This feature attempts to capture the overall financial stability and liquidity by evaluating account statuses together, potentially enhancing credit approval predictions by providing richer context around the applicant's financial behavior.

2026-01-30 15:34:42,922 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features aimed at improving the downstream model's performance. Each step involves the creation of new features using different operations:

1. <credit_duration_rescaled><minmax><duration><Create a rescaled version of the duration feature to normalize its effect within credit prediction models>

   Reasoning: Rescaling the duration using min-max scaling can help standardize its range, making it easier to compare across different credit applications. This normalization might improve the model's ability to find patterns in credit duration related to credit approval.

2. <job_savings_combination><cross><job><savings_status><Assess_financial_situations_by_combining_job_type_and_savings_status>

   Reasoning: Cross-combining job types with savings account status can provide insights into financial stability and management skills. This interaction might reveal patterns indicating which job and savings combinations contribute positively or negatively to credit approvals.

3. <credit_history_duration_interaction><cross><credit_history><duration><Combine_credit_history_with_duration_to_evaluate_credit_behavior_over_time>

   Reasoning: Combining credit history with credit duration can help assess how historical credit behaviors influence the decision over different loan durations. This feature can reveal whether certain credit histories are more likely to impact short or long-term credit approval decisions.

2026-01-30 15:34:47,841 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps designed to improve the downstream model's performance in predicting credit approval:

1. <credit_duration_adjusted><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Evaluate_credit_amount_relative_to_duration_for_assessing_financial_commitment_over_time>
   - Reasoning: This feature calculates the ratio of credit amount to the duration of the credit, providing insights into comparative financial intensity. It assesses the applicants' financial commitment over time, helping determine if they are likely to manage larger credits over longer periods.

2. <employment_credit_plan_interaction_score><cross><employment_payment_plan_resilience><credit_history_duration_interaction><Combine_employment_resilience_with_credit_history_and_duration_to_assess_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: By combining employment payment plan resilience with credit history duration interaction, this feature aims to capture the stability of an applicant's financial behavior over time. It evaluates whether consistent employment combined with managed credit history suggests reliable financial management.

3. <job_savings_resilience_enhanced><cross><job_savings_combination><credit_duration_rescaled><Enhance_financial_resilience_evaluation_by_combining_job_savings_status_with_normalized_credit_duration>
   - Reasoning: This feature merges job and savings status with a rescaled credit duration, providing an enhanced view of the applicant's financial resilience. The combination of job type, savings level, and normalized credit duration reflects financial stability and decision-making capacity over normalized timeframes.

   Reasoning: By combining employment payment plan resilience and credit history duration interaction, we can evaluate how an individual's employment stability and credit behavior over time can impact their financial stability. This could be useful in assessing their likelihood to receive credit.

2. <credit_duration_intensity_score><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Evaluate_impact_of_credit_amount_relative_to_credit_duration_on_investment_intensity>  
   Reasoning: The ratio of credit amount to duration gives an indication of credit intensity, helping to understand the credit's impact over time. High credit intensity might reflect a higher risk, impacting credit approval decisions.

3. <employment_financial_health_score><cross><job_savings_combination><checking_savings_interaction><Combining_job_and_savings_status_with_checking_savings_interaction_to_assess_financial_health>  
   Reasoning: This feature combines job and savings status with checking-savings interaction, which might provide valuable insights into the overall financial health of the individual. Evaluating their financial management skills could directly impact credit decisions.

   *Reasoning*: By calculating the average credit duration rescaled for each category in the credit history duration interaction, we can identify patterns and assess behavior in credit predictions over time.

2. <financial_resilience_assessment><cross><employment_payment_plan_resilience><savings_status><Assess_financial_resilience_by_combining_employment_stability_with_savings_status>  
   *Reasoning*: Combining employment payment plan resilience with savings status could provide insights into an individual's financial stability, assessing their ability to handle financial strain.

3. <credit_amount_scaled><sigmoid><credit_amount><Evaluate_smooth_transformation_of_credit_amount_to_normalize_its_influence_in_credit_predictions>  
   *Reasoning*: Applying a sigmoid transformation to the credit amount helps smooth extreme values and allows better normalization in models predicting credit receipt, improving the predictions by reducing the impact of outliers.

This interaction can reveal patterns on whether certain purposes cause longer credit commitments or not, which is valuable for credit evaluation.

2. <financial_history_cross><cross><credit_history><employment_payment_plan_resilience><Combine credit history with employment resilience to assess overall credit behavior stability>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit history with employment resilience offers insight into how past credit behaviors interact with the individual's current financial resilience. This helps to understand overall credit stability, considering both historical and current financial habits and stability factors.

3. <scaled_credit_resilience_score><minmax><employment_payment_plan_resilience><Scale employment resilience score to normalize influence in credit prediction>
   - Reasoning: Scaling the employment resilience score can help mitigate skewness in employment resilience data, thereby providing a normalized view on how employment statuses contribute to credit risk prediction across various situations. Normalizing this feature ensures that it doesn't disproportionately impact the model's decisions.

These engineered features aim to capture interactions and scales that can significantly enhance the predictive power of the model by integrating categories with numerical evaluations and cross-referencing stability and history factors in the credit prediction context.

   - Reasoning: This feature evaluates how intense a credit request is by comparing the amount requested to the duration over which it will be paid. A higher ratio might indicate higher risk, useful for credit risk assessments.

2. <job_financial_stability_score><cross><job><checking_savings_interaction><Evaluate_the_combination_of_job_type_with_checking_and_savings_interaction_to_assess_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: Combining job types with the financial status represented by checking_savings_interaction can provide insight into an individual's overall financial stability, potentially improving credit prediction accuracy through enhanced profiling of applicants.

3. <purpose_credit_history_interaction><cross><purpose><credit_history_duration_interaction><Explore_the_interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_credit_history_duration_to_assess_creditworthiness_based_on_behavioral_patterns>
   - Reasoning: Credit purpose combined with historical credit behavior and its duration can reflect behavioral patterns regarding credit management. Identifying consistent or problematic trends relative to the purpose of credits can offer deeper insights for credit approval decisions.

2026-01-30 15:35:25,452 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_amount_purpose_scaled\>\<cross\>\<credit_amount_scaled\>\<purpose\>\<Assess_purpose-driven_credit_patterns_by_combining_scaled_credit_amount_with_purpose>

   Reasoning: By cross-referencing the scaled credit amount with the credit purpose, this feature aims to understand how the credit purpose influences the scaled credit amount, potentially revealing valuable insights for credit predictions based on the purpose of the loan.

2. \<checking_savings_dur_rescaled_interaction\>\<cross\>\<checking_savings_interaction\>\<credit_duration_rescaled\>\<Analyze_how_the_interaction_between_checking_and_savings_accounts_influences_the_rescaled_credit_duration>

   Reasoning: This feature attempts to capture the influence of the financial status indicated by the checking and savings account interaction on the rescaled credit duration, which could help identify behavior patterns associated with longer credit durations and distinct financial profiles.

3. \<employment_job_monetary_stability\>\<cross\>\<employment_payment_plan_resilience\>\<job\>\<Assess_financial_stability_and_risk_by_combining_employment_payment_resilience_with_job_type>

   Reasoning: By combining employment payment resilience with job type, we can assess the financial stability and risk associated with different employment types, potentially capturing insights that help predict creditworthiness based on both employment and job factors.
