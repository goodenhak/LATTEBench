   - Reasoning: Age and credit score are critical indicators of financial reliability. By multiplying them, we capture the impact of these two features combined, which could better indicate an individual's suitability for a credit card.

2. <EmployedIncomeRatio><ratio><Income><Employed><Ratio between income and employment status to enhance prediction of financial stability>
   - Reasoning: Individuals with stable employment are likely to have consistent income, affecting their credit card application success. The ratio offers a nuanced view of income reliability relative to employment status.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreReciprocal><reciprocal><IndustryCreditScoreMean><Inverse of industry-specific credit score to explore new correlations with credit card application success>
   - Reasoning: Investigating the reciprocal of industry credit scores may uncover unique patterns in how industry-specific credit reliability impacts outcomes, providing an alternative perspective for the predictive model.

2026-01-31 10:52:00,266 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Creating new features can help improve the performance of the downstream model by capturing more complex relationships within the data. Let's analyze the dataset's existing features and operations to create potentially useful new features:

1. <IncomeAdjustedForAge><ratio><Income><Age><Ratio_of_income_to_age_to_understand_financial_stability_relative_to_age>  
   - *Reasoning:* This feature calculates the income-to-age ratio, which can help capture whether individuals have relatively higher or lower income given their age. This can be a significant predictor of creditworthiness, as younger people with higher income relative to their age might be considered more financially stable.

2. <EmployedByPriorDefaultInteraction><cross><IndustryEmployedInteraction><PriorDefault><Captures_combined_effect_of_employment_status,_industry_and_prior_default_on_creditworthiness>  
   - *Reasoning:* By interacting with previous default status and the existing IndustryEmployedInteraction, this feature captures whether prior defaults coupled with the employment status in specific industries affect credit card application success. This enhances understanding of risk associated with employment and industry factors linked to defaults.

3. <AgeBinCitizenshipCross><cross><AgeBin><Citizen><Interaction_of_age_bins_with_citizenship_status_for_potential_impact_on_creditworthiness>  
   - *Reasoning:* Binning age into categories or bins and then crossing this with citizenship status may highlight age-related characteristics unique to different citizenship groups. This can potentially correlate with behavioral or regulatory factors impacting credit card application success.

3. \<CitizenEmployedInteraction\>\<cross\>\<Citizen\>\<Employed\>\<Analyzes combined effect of citizenship status and employment on potential access to credit\> 

Reasoning:
1. The first feature, CreditScoreAgeInteraction, aims to evaluate the compounded effect of an individual's credit score and age, which may provide insight into creditworthiness adjusted for age, addressing potential risks associated with younger or older applicants.

2. The second proposed feature IndustryIncomeInteraction leverages industry-specific insights combined with income data to understand how these two factors influence financial stability and propensity to succeed in credit card applications. This feature may uncover unique patterns across different job sectors.

3. The last feature CitizenEmployedInteraction examines the intersection of citizenship status and employment, a factor that could offer deeper insights into the legal standing and job security of an applicant, which might play a crucial role in credit decisions, especially in regions with a high proportion of temporary workers.

2026-01-31 10:52:26,482 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the specified operations:

1. <CreditScoreYearsEmployedRatio><ratio><CreditScore><YearsEmployed><Ratio_of_credit_score_to_years_employed_to_adjust_creditworthiness_based_on_employment_history>
   - Reasoning: This feature assesses how much creditworthiness is supported by the individual's work experience. A high ratio implies strong creditworthiness relative to employment duration, potentially indicating reliability in financial commitments despite limited work history.

2. <AgePriorDefaultInteraction><cross><Age><PriorDefault><Combined_effect_of_age_and_prior_default_history_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Integrating age with prior defaults can highlight generational risk behaviors. Younger applicants with prior defaults may face stricter assessments, while older applicants with defaults might be seen as recoverable. This interaction could provide nuanced insights into the risk related to financial maturity and historical reliability.

3. <IndustryIncomeScaled><minmax><Income><Scaled_income_based_on_industry_specific_attributes_to_reflect_relative_financial_capabilities>
   - Reasoning: Scaling income according to industry context adjusts for sector-specific earning potential, giving a sense of financial stability and compatibility within industry limits. This adjustment helps narrow into the realistic financial capabilities relative to industry profiles, enhancing prediction accuracy.

2026-01-31 10:52:33,041 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are the three possible next steps for feature engineering:

1. <AgeCreditScoreRatio><ratio><Age><CreditScore><Ratio_of_age_to_credit_score_to_assess_age-adjusted_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By examining the ratio between age and credit score, this feature helps assess if older individuals with the same credit score as younger ones have better creditworthiness due to more established credit history.

2. <PriorDefaultIndustryEmployedCross><cross><PriorDefault><IndustryEmployedInteraction><Combined_effect_of_prior_default_status_industry_and_employment_status_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Combining the impact of prior default status and the industry-employment interaction can provide insights into how these factors jointly affect credit card application success.

3. <CitizenIncomeBin><bin><Citizen><Income><Categorizing_income_based_on_citizenship_status_to_explore_financial_stability_and_credit_card_application_outcomes>
   - Reasoning: This feature bins income by citizenship status, investigating whether certain citizenship types correlate with specific income levels, ultimately affecting credit card application success.

2026-01-31 10:52:52,921 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance prediction success and explore potentially impactful features, let's focus on the following next steps, employing a combination of existing features and operations:

### Feature Engineering Steps:

1. Interaction Feature Reflecting Combined Impact of Financial Devices
   - This feature aims to capture the interaction between income, credit score, and prior default status, which can be crucial in determining financial stability and creditworthiness.
   - <IncomeCreditScorePriorDefaultInteraction><cross><Income><multiply><CreditScore><PriorDefault><Combined_feature_augmenting_financial_stability_reflected_by_income_credit_score_and_prior_default_status>

2. Normalization of Credit Score Relative to Industry-Specific Credit Score Mean
   - By normalizing credit score by the industry-specific credit score mean, we can assess individual creditworthiness relative to industry standards. This normalization can highlight individuals who outperform or underperform compared to their industry's average creditworthiness.
   - <CreditScoreNormalizedByIndustryCreditScoreMean><ratio><CreditScore><IndustryCreditScoreMean><Normalization_to_assess_individual_creditworthiness_relative_to_industry_standards>

3. Combined Citizen and Age Interaction Feature
   - This feature captures the interaction between citizenship status and age. Given the Array of citizenship categories and their potential implications across different ages, this interaction can reflect different financial stabilities and credit card application probabilities.
   - <CitizenAgeInteraction><cross><Citizen><Age><Combined_feature_reflecting_interaction_between_citizenship_status_and_age_for_better_credit_card_application_modeling>

### Reasoning:

- IncomeCreditScorePriorDefaultInteraction: Income, credit score, and prior default are direct financial indicators. Their interaction might reveal complex relationships that influence credit card application success. This combined feature leverages the multiplicative nature of income and credit score influence under varying prior default circumstances.

- CreditScoreNormalizedByIndustryCreditScoreMean: Credit scores often reflect personal financial reliability, but in relation to industry norms, one can gauge whether an individual's financial behavior is remarkable or concerning compared to peers. This feature adjusts for industry bias, which might enhance model precision on assessing credit card applications.

- CitizenAgeInteraction: Citizenship status might influence credit history depth and perceived stability, while age affects experience and potential risk levels. Interacting these variables captures a nuanced understanding of how different demographic factors might shape credit card application outcomes, offering a more detailed view on eligibility considerations.

By incorporating these features, we can explore varying dimensions of applicant data to potentially boost modeling performance and predictive accuracy in determining credit card application success.

2026-01-31 10:53:06,640 - INFO - LLM Output: Generating features to improve the model's performance involves considering interactions and modifications of existing features that better capture underlying patterns related to credit card application success. Below are three potential features:

1. <PriorDefaultAgeRatio><ratio><Age><PriorDefault><Calculates_ratio_of_age_to_prior_default_status_to_assess_combined_effect_of_age_on_credit_risk_behavior>
   - Reasoning: By dividing age by prior default status, the feature explores whether age influences the impact of prior defaults on credit card application outcomes. Older applicants might overcome prior defaults more effectively due to financial maturity.

2. <IndustryCreditScoreYearsEmployedInteraction><multiply><IndustryCreditScoreMean><YearsEmployed><Combined_effect_of_industry-specific_credit_score_and_employment_duration_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying industry credit score mean and years employed captures the joint impact of industry-specific credit risks and employment stability on application success, assuming industry-specific financial behaviors correlate with employment duration.

3. <CitizenCreditScoreInteraction><cross><Citizen><CreditScore><Explores_combined_effect_of_citizenship_status_and_credit_score_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Interaction between citizenship status and credit score may uncover patterns where certain citizenship categories affect credit score significance, potentially revealing how citizenship influences creditworthiness.

   - Reasoning: Combining prior default status with citizenship status could provide insights into how different citizenship categories affect the predictive power of prior default history.

2. <IncomeAgeZscore><zscore><Income><Standard_score_of_income_to_reduce_effect_of_outliers_based_on_age_for_improved_financial_stability_modeling>
   - Reasoning: By normalizing income using a z-score, we can mitigate the effect of outliers. Since age is a reliable measure of baseline financial stability, this transformation should improve the detection of potential creditworthiness.

3. <CitizenCreditScoreInteraction><cross><Citizen><CreditScore><Explores_combined_effect_of_citizenship_status_and_credit_score_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Citizenship status might influence the interpretation of credit scores, as different citizenship categories may experience varying levels of access to, or impact from, credit systems. This feature can highlight nuanced relationships in credit card application success.

2026-01-31 10:53:19,382 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions of credit card application success in potential customers, consider generating features that leverage interactions between existing variables favorably correlated with success. Below are three potential steps using defined operations:

1. <CreditScoreIndustryAdjusted><ratio><CreditScore><IndustryCreditScoreMean><Adjustment_of_credit_score_relative_to_particular_industry_credit_score_mean_to_examine_industry-specific_creditworthiness_performance>
   - Reasoning: This feature assesses individual creditworthiness compared to industry norms, potentially revealing a more nuanced view of applicant reliability. Credit scores adjusted for industry-specific risk can identify applicants who excel compared to their peers, leading to improved model predictions.

2. <PriorDefaultCitizenRisk><cross><PriorDefault><Citizen><Interaction_of_prior_default_status_with_citizenship_to_explore_combined_effect_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between prior default history and citizenship status may capture unexplored societal or behavioral trends that impact credit card application outcomes. Certain citizenship statuses combined with prior defaults could indicate higher or lower risk, providing the model with enhanced predictive power.

3. <IncomeAgeSqrt><sqrt><Income><Age><Exploring_financial_stability_by_applying_square_root_scaling_to_income_then_adjusting_by_age_to_provide_insight_into_potential_income_level_with_age_adjustments>
   - Reasoning: Adjusting income by the square root function smoothens outlier impacts, while considering age in conjunction focuses on different life stages potentially affecting financial stability. This could identify more stable applicants likely to be successful in credit card applications by examining income profiles at varying ages.

   Reasoning: This feature combines age, years employed, and citizenship status to give an insight into how these factors jointly impact financial stability and credit card application success. It could help capture scenarios where citizenship influences employment duration and age-related experience.

2. <CreditScoreIndustryScaled><minmax><IndustryCreditScoreMean><CreditScore><Scaled_industry_specific_credit_score_based_on_individual_credit_score_to_refine_creditworthiness_estimation>

   Reasoning: By scaling industry credit score with individual credit score, we examine how an individual's credit performance compares to the average industry standards, potentially highlighting discrepancies in perceived creditworthiness.

3. <IncomeEmployedInteraction><multiply><Income><YearsEmployed><Interaction_between_income_and_employment_duration_to_examine_long-term_financial_growth_and_stability_with_potential_to_improve_credit_card_application_outcomes>

   Reasoning: This feature assesses the combined effect of income level and employment duration, serving as a potential measure of long-term financial growth. By exploring the interaction between these two numerical attributes, we can better understand the individual's financial trajectory and stability.

   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction effect between citizenship status and industry-specific credit scores. Different citizenship types might face distinct levels of scrutiny based on industry-related risks, influencing credit card application success.

2. <IncomeAgeStability><ratio><Income><Age><Ratio_of_income_to_age_to_assess_income_stability_relative_to_age,_potentially_impacting_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: This ratio can provide insights into financial maturity and stability related to age. Older applicants with lower income might represent a different risk profile compared to younger ones with the same income level, affecting credit application success.

3. <CreditScoreEmployedInteraction><cross><CreditScore><YearsEmployed><Combined_feature_reflecting_the_interaction_between_credit_score_and_years_of_employment_for_assessing_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: This feature considers both credit score and employment duration, which are critical indicators of an individual’s financial reliability. Combining these can potentially reveal applicants with steady employment and good credit or those who might have short employment history but a strong credit score.

   Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the nuanced interaction between prior default history and industry-specific credit risk factors. Prior defaults indicate potential credit risk, and combining this with industry-specific credit scores could help assess the likelihood of credit card application success.

2. <AgeCitizenNormalized><minmax><Age><Citizen><Scaling_age_relative_to_citizenship_status_to_explore_combined_impact_on_financial_stability_for_credit_card_application_success>

   Reasoning: Citizenship status can affect financial stability, and normalizing age against this categorical feature can highlight differences between age groups within citizenship statuses. This can help capture potential variances in creditworthiness due to age and citizenship interactions.

3. <IncomeEmployedYearsInteraction><multiply><Income><YearsEmployed><Assesses_the_joint_impact_of_income_and_employment_duration_on_financial_stability_for_credit_card_application_success>

   Reasoning: Income and years employed are critical indicators of financial stability. Multiplying these features creates an interaction that reflects long-term financial growth potential, which may enhance prediction of credit card application outcomes.

2026-01-31 10:53:49,661 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three steps to generate new features using the operations, aimed at improving the predictive performance of the downstream model:

1. <EmployedIncomeRatio><ratio><Income><YearsEmployed><Calculates_ratio_of_income_to_years_employed_as_a_measure_of_financial_stability_acquired_through_employment_duration>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the impact of income stability and employment duration jointly, as more years of employment may reflect greater experience and financial stability, thus potentially impacting credit card application success positively.

2. <IndustryCitizenEmployedCross><cross><Industry><CitizenIndustryInteraction><Reflecting_combined_effect_of_industry,_citizenship_status,_and_employment_conditions_on_credit_card_application_outcomes>
   - Reasoning: This feature encapsulates the joint effects of industry, citizenship, and employment status, bringing together three influences that may affect credit card application success. Historically, employment stability, industry specifics, and citizenship have played important roles in credit evaluations.

3. <AgePriorDefaultInteraction><cross><Age><PriorDefault><Combined_feature_reflecting_the_impact_of_age_and_prior_default_history_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Age alongside prior defaults can significantly impact creditworthiness. Younger applicants with prior defaults may be seen more negatively compared to older applicants. This interaction captures the nuanced effect of age-adjusted credit risk assessment.

These features are designed to extract meaningful combinations and interactions between crucial aspects such as financial stability, industry-specific characteristics, and historical credit behavior to optimize prediction accuracy in credit card applications.

   Reasoning: By multiplying the Credit Score and Years Employed, we can create a feature that captures the extent to which the credit score is supported by a stable employment history, which could be indicative of an applicant's financial credibility.

2. <IndustryCitizenEffect><cross><Industry><Citizen><Evaluating_the_combined_influence_of_industry_sector_and_citizenship_status_on_credit_card_application_success>

   Reasoning: Utilizing a cross operation between Industry and Citizenship can provide insights into how the socio-economic context (industry sector) and legal/relational context (citizenship) interact to affect credit application success, potentially uncovering unique patterns.

3. <IncomeAgeRatioZscore><zscore><IncomeAgeRatio><Standardized_income_to_age_ratio_to_suppress_outliers_and_provide_clearer_insight_into_relative_financial_security>  

   Reasoning: Standardizing the Income to Age Ratio can help reduce the impact of outliers and present a clearer depiction of the applicant's financial maturity relative to their age, potentially improving prediction performance by offering a more normalized perspective of financial stability.

   Reasoning: This feature explores the potential impact of having a prior default in relation to the combined effect of citizenship status and industry on credit card success rates. Given the importance of prior credit history and the variable effects of citizenship across industries, this interaction could reveal new insights into applicant success.

2. <YearsEmployedIncomeNegateInteraction><negate><multiply><YearsEmployed><Income><Inverse_interaction_feature_between_years_employed_and_income_to_assess_potential_distress_or_financial_instability_affecting_credit_card_application_success>

   Reasoning: Negating the product of years employed and income emphasizes situations where a higher income and longer employment do not translate to credit card success, potentially due to financial mismanagement or other factors. This transformation could help model financial instability patterns.

3. <AgeSineCitizenInteraction><cross><sine><Age><CitizenIndustryInteraction><Capturing_combined_effect_of_age_with_citizenship_industry_interaction_influenced_by_age_periodicity_for_credit_card_application_modeling>

   Reasoning: Applying the sine transformation to age introduces cyclical patterns, which might indicate periods of financial maturity or instability linked to age. Combining this effect with the citizenship-industry interaction can highlight age-sensitive dynamics relevant to credit card application success.

1. <IncomeCreditScoreRatio><ratio><Income><CreditScore><Ratio_of_income_to_credit_score_to_assess_financial_stability_relative_to_credit_information>  
   *Reasoning: This feature combines the financial aspect of income with the reliability indicated by credit scores, providing insight into how income levels support creditworthiness, potentially enhancing predictions of credit card application success.*

2. <AgeEmployedReciprocal><reciprocal><AgeEmployedRatio><Inverse_of_AgeEmployedRatio_to_explore_alternate_relationship_between_relative_experience_and_financial_stability>  
   *Reasoning: Taking the reciprocal of the AgeEmployedRatio may reveal insights into financial stability from a different perspective, possibly capturing nuances in relative experience that affect credit card application outcomes.*

3. <IndustryCitizenEffectMultiply><multiply><IndustryCreditScoreMean><CitizenshipStatusLabel><Impact_of_combined_industry-specific_creditworthiness_and_citizenship_status_on_credit_card_application_outcomes>  
   *Reasoning: Label encoding Citizenship status to numerical representation and multiplying with IndustryCreditScoreMean helps capture how industry risk profiles intersect with the applicant's citizenship status, potentially enhancing model predictions by addressing demographic and sector-driven credit risk.*
