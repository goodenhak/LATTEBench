2026-01-30 16:00:16,249 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that aim to improve the performance of the downstream model for predicting credit card application success:

1. \<IncomeDebtRatio\><divide><Income><Debt>\<This_feature_represents_the_ratio_of_income_to_outstanding_debt_which_may_indicate_financial_responsibility_or_the_ability_to_manage_debt\>
   - Reasoning: This feature measures how much income is available per unit of outstanding debt. A higher ratio may indicate better financial health, potentially leading to higher chances of credit card approval.

2. \<MarriageCitizenInteraction\><cross><Married><Citizen>\<This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_marital_status_and_citizenship,which_may_capture_sociodemographic_factors_affecting_creditworthiness\>
   - Reasoning: Different combinations of marital status and citizenship might have distinct patterns in credit card approvals. This interaction can help capture such relationships that individual variables might miss.

3. \<DebtAgeCreditScoreInteraction\><multiply><Debt><AgeCreditScoreRatio>\<This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_outstanding_debt_and_age_to_credit_score_ratio,_potentially_indicating_how_age_related_creditworthiness_impacts_debt_handling\>
   - Reasoning: By interacting outstanding debt with the age-to-credit-score ratio, this feature may capture nuanced insights into how age-related creditworthiness impacts an individual's ability to handle debt, thus influencing credit card approval likelihood.

2026-01-30 16:00:26,802 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream task of predicting successful credit card applications, we should focus on generating features that capture meaningful interactions between the existing features and transformations that can potentially enhance the model's ability to discriminate between classes. Here are three potential next steps for feature engineering:

1. <DebtToIncomeEmployedInteraction><multiply><DebtIncomeRatio><EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_debt_to_income_ratio_and_stability_in_employment,capturing_both_financial_stress_and_employment_stability>

   Reasoning: Combining the DebtIncomeRatio with EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction provides an indicator of both financial stress and employment stability. This can help in assessing whether individuals with stable employment but high debt can still manage their finances efficiently.

2. <IndustryMaritalStatusInteraction><cross><Industry><Married><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry_and_marital_status,which_could_capture_how_different_sectors_and_personal_life_stability_affect_credit_approval>

   Reasoning: The industry in which a person works may have different implications based on their marital status. Some industries might have variable income or job security, which, when combined with marital stability, can provide insights into financial management ability and success in credit applications.

3. <LogDebt><log><Debt><This_feature_transforms_outstanding_debt_to_a_log_scale_to_reduce_skewness_and_improve_normality,providing_a_better_fit_for_statistical_models>

   Reasoning: Transforming Debt to a log scale can handle skewness and large variation in data, which is crucial for linear models and may enhance the ability to model relationships between debt and other financial indicators more effectively.

These features are engineered with the goal of capturing important interactions and reducing variance in numerical features, which could lead to improved prediction performance in the downstream task.

2026-01-30 16:00:45,201 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that could potentially improve the prediction model for credit card approvals, we'll focus on interactions, transformations, and normalizations that capture additional insights from the data. Here's a suggestion for three new features:

1. Log-Normalized Debt-to-Income Ratio:
   - The DebtIncomeRatio is highly skewed, so applying a logarithmic transformation can help in normalizing this feature and reducing extreme outlier effects in the model.
   - <LogDebtIncome<log><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_transforms_the_debt_to_income_ratio_to_a_log_scale_to_handle_extreme_values_and_reduce_skewness,improving_model_fit_and_prediction_accuracy>

2. Interaction between Employment and Having a Driver's License:
   - The presence of a driver's license might indicate additional responsibility. Coupling it with the employment status can give a better picture of an individual's stability and responsibility, which could affect creditworthiness.
   - <EmploymentDriverInteraction<cross><Employed><DriversLicense><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status_and_having_a_driver's_license,indicating_stability_and_responsibility_which_may_influence_credit_approval_decisions>

3. Categorical Encoding for Industry and Citizenship Interaction:
   - Interaction between the sector of employment (Industry) and Citizen status can be crucial. Certain sectors may value particular citizenship statuses due to regulatory constraints, thus affecting credit scores.
   - <IndustryCitizenInteraction<cross><Industry><Citizen><This_feature_encodes_the_interaction_between_industry_sector_and_citizenship_status_to_capture_industry-specific_impact_of_nationality_on_credit_approval>

These feature engineering steps aim to introduce transformed and interaction-based features into the dataset, potentially enhancing the predictive power of the model by capturing non-linear patterns and addressing skewness.

2026-01-30 16:00:54,841 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps for generating new features using the given operations, aimed at improving the downstream model's performance for predicting credit card application success:

1. <AdjustedDebtIncome><divide><Debt><IncomePlusOne><This_feature_adjusts_debt_by_the_inverse_of_(income_plus_one)_to_prevent_division_by_zero_and_reduce_variability_of_income_effect>
   - Rationale: The DebtIncomeRatio shows a large variability due to extreme values in income, which can be mitigated by using Debt divided by (Income plus one). This transformation can help normalize the relationship by including a small constant, reducing the skew caused by income being zero, which can improve model interpretability and performance.

2. <EmployedMaritalStatusInteraction><cross><Employed><label_encode><Married><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status_and_marital_status_by_encoding_Marital_as_a_label,_capturing_the_combined_effect_of_job_status_and_marriage_on_creditworthiness>
   - Rationale: Employment and marital status can be strong indicators of financial stability. By encoding the marital status to a numerical label and crossing it with employment, this feature captures nuances where, perhaps, married individuals with stable employment may be deemed more creditworthy.

3. <NormalizedAgeCreditScore><zscore><AgeCreditScoreRatio><This_feature_normalizes_the_age_to_credit_score_ratio_using_a_z-score,_helping_to_standardize_the_feature_and_reduce_the_effect_of_outliers>
   - Rationale: The AgeCreditScoreRatio is a composite feature with high variance. Using a z-score helps to normalize this feature, bringing it onto a common scale and reducing the impact of outliers, allowing the model to better understand the relationship between age, credit score, and credit approval outcomes.

### Possible Feature Engineering Steps

1. IndustryMarriageCitizenInteraction
   - Operator: cross
   - Features: Industry, Married and Citizen
   - Reasoning: Understanding the interaction between the industry someone works in, their marital status, and their citizenship can provide insights into credit behavior and risk assessment. Different industries might offer varying levels of job stability and income, and this might be influenced by marital status and citizenship type, impacting creditworthiness.
   - <IndustryMarriageCitizenInteraction><cross><Industry><Married><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry,marital_status,and_citizenship_to_capture_sociodemographic_effects_on_creditworthiness> 

2. IncomeDebtInteraction
   - Operator: multiply
   - Features: Income, Debt
   - Reasoning: Multiplying income by debt captures an interaction that might be reflective of an individual's financial situation more thoroughly than considering either alone. It captures both the burden of debt relative to income and the capacity to repay.
   - <IncomeDebtInteraction><multiply><Income><Debt><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_income_and_debt,reflecting_a_person's_capacity_to_manage_outstanding_debt_based_on_income>

3. EmployedMarriedDriverInteraction
   - Operator: cross
   - Features: Employed, Married, DriversLicense
   - Reasoning: This interaction captures whether employment status, marital status, and having a driver’s license together influence credit card application outcomes. Being employed, married, and having a driver's license could collectively signify stability and creditworthiness.
   - <EmployedMarriedDriverInteraction><cross><Employed><Married><DriversLicense><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status,marital_status_and_possession_of_a_driver’s_license_to_indicate_stability_and_responsibility>

2026-01-30 16:01:08,253 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's create three possible next steps for feature generation using the given operations. The aim is to engineer features that could enhance the predictive accuracy of a model built to determine successful credit card applications.

### Step 1: Interaction Between Employment and Citizenship

1. <EmployedCitizenInteraction><cross><Employed><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status_and_citizenship_to_capture_the_combined_effect_of_being_employed_and_citizenship_status_on_creditworthiness>:

   Reasoning: The employment status combined with citizenship status could provide additional context on an individual's stability and legitimacy in the country, which might affect their creditworthiness and subsequent approval for a credit card.

### Step 2: Normalization of Income

2. <NormalizedIncome><zscore><Income><This_feature_normalizes_income_by_calculating_a_z_score_to_standardize_the_income_across_individuals_and_handle_outliers_effectively>:

   Reasoning: Income, when standardized using a z-score, can lead to better comparisons across applicants. This can make the population distribution more pronounced for model learning by centralizing this variable around its mean with a standard deviation variance.

### Step 3: Interaction Between Industry and Debt

3. <IndustryDebtInteraction><cross><Industry><Debt><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_an_applicant's_industry_and_outstanding_debt,which_could_illuminate_how_certain_industries_handle_loan_repaiement_and_financial_risks>:

   Reasoning: Different industries have differing average income levels and job stability, which could influence how effectively individuals from those industries manage debt. This feature might reveal how industry-level differences affect financial risk-taking and responsibility, impacting credit card approval likelihood.

These engineered features aim to provide additional insights into an individual's financial and demographic background, potentially capturing latent patterns that could better predict credit card approval success.

2026-01-30 16:01:15,155 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed feature engineering steps designed to potentially improve the performance of the downstream credit card application prediction model:

1. IncomeScaling
   
   <IncomeNormalized><zscore><Income><This_feature_standardizes_income_by_calculating_a_z_score,_helping_to_make_income_data_comparable_across_individuals_and_reducing_the_impact_of_extreme_values>
   
   *Reasoning*: By normalizing the income data, this feature can help in reducing the effect of extreme income values, making it easier to compare across individuals and potentially improving the learning of the model with more consistent scaling. 

2. DebtInteractionWithDemographics
   
   <DebtMaritalCitizenInteraction><cross><Debt><Married><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_outstanding_debt,_marital_status,_and_citizenship,_which_could_capture_relationship_patterns_relevant_to_credit_approval_based_on_sociodemographic_factors>
   
   *Reasoning*: This feature captures complex demographic patterns by interacting outstanding debt with marital status and citizenship, and it could reveal hidden relational patterns that affect creditworthiness. 

3. EmploymentIncomeRatio
   
   <EmploymentStabilityIncomeRatio><divide><EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction><Income><This_feature_represents_the_ratio_of_employment_stability_to_income,_indicating_whether_longer-term_employment_relates_to_lower_or_higher_income_levels>
   
   *Reasoning*: This feature aims to understand how the stability of employment (measured by EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction) relates to income, which could inform the model about whether stable employment correlates with certain income levels that affect credit applications.

2026-01-30 16:01:22,289 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential new feature engineering steps that could potentially improve the model's performance:

1. <DebtIncomeMarriedInteraction><cross><DebtIncomeRatio><Married><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_the_debt_to_income_ratio_and_marital_status,_which_may_capture_how_financial_stress_and_marital_stability_affect_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Marital status might affect financial responsibilities and stability. By interacting debt-to-income ratios with marital status, this feature could capture how being married influences creditworthiness when facing certain debt levels.

2. <IncomeCitizenInteraction><cross><Income><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_income_levels_and_citizenship_status,_which_may_capture_socioeconomic_factors_and_stability_impacting_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Different citizenship statuses might imply differing levels of stability and financial responsibility. Interacting this with income could indicate the impact on creditworthiness from both a socioeconomic and stability perspective.

3. <DebtReciprocal><reciprocal><Debt><This_feature_transforms_outstanding_debt_to_its_reciprocal,_which_can_reduce_the_skewness_and_handle_high_values_better,_potentially_highlighting_differences_in_creditworthiness_when_detecting_unseen_patterns>
   - Reasoning: Using a reciprocal transformation on debt can help handle skewed data, improving model behavior related to debt influence on creditworthiness, especially in cases where high outstanding debt may mask interesting patterns.

   - Reasoning: The DebtIncomeRatio feature has a very large range and high standard deviation. Applying a logarithmic transformation could help in reducing skewness and bringing extreme values closer to the central data distribution, which could make it more useful for prediction.

2. <IndustryMarriedInteraction><cross><Industry><Married><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry_and_marital_status_which_could_capture_how_different_sectors_affect_personal_life_stability_and_thus_influence_credit_approval>  
   - Reasoning: The interaction between Industry and marital status (Married) might reveal how personal life stability within different sectors affects credit approval decisions. Certain industries might have more stable job conditions, which could influence the marital status and credit card application success rate.

3. <EmployedCitizenInteraction><cross><Employed><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status_and_citizenship_to_capture_the_combined_effect_of_being_employed_and_citizenship_status_on_creditworthiness>  
   - Reasoning: Combining employment status with citizenship could provide insights into how job security varies with citizenship, potentially impacting creditworthiness. For instance, employed individuals with permanent citizenship might be more stable financially compared to temporary citizens, affecting their credit card application success.

2026-01-30 16:01:43,932 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that could potentially improve the prediction of whether a person is successful in applying for a credit card, let's leverage a mix of interaction, transformation, and type conversion operations:

1. <IndustryIncomeInteraction><cross><Industry><Income><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry_and_income_to_capture_how_income_varies_across_different_sectors,_which_may_reflect_industry-specific_income_stability_or_risks_affecting_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Different industries might dictate different income levels and stability, impacting credit risk. Capturing this interaction could highlight patterns in how income related to industry affects credit card application success.

2. <DebtIncomeNormalized><log><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_normalizes_the_debt_to_income_ratio_to_handle_extreme_values_and_skewness,_making_it_easier_for_models_to_detect_relationships_with_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Applying a log transformation can handle extreme values in the DebtIncomeRatio, allowing the feature to be more statistically tractable and potentially revealing patterns associated with creditworthiness.

3. <MarriedCitizenInteraction><cross><Married><label_encode><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_marital_status_and_citizenship_to_capture_combined_sociodemographic_effects_on_creditworthiness,_reflecting_how_marital_status_and_citizenship_influence_credit_card_approval>
   - Reasoning: Marital status and citizenship status may jointly impact an individual's financial stability and trustworthiness. Capturing this combination could provide insights into how these sociodemographic factors affect credit card application outcomes.

These steps aim to introduce features that capture meaningful patterns and interactions that might influence credit card application success, leveraging both direct transformations and interactions between categorical and numerical aspects of the dataset.

   - Reasoning: This feature could capture regional variations in employment stability by combining geographical location (ZipCode) with long-term employment indicators (EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction), potentially affecting creditworthiness.

2. <IndustryDebtIncomeRatioInteraction><cross><Industry><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry_and_the_debt_to_income_ratio,_capturing_industry-specific_patterns_in_financial_risk,_which_may_affect_credit_approval_decisions>
   - Reasoning: By exploring how different industries (Industry) interact with financial stress indicators like the debt-to-income ratio, this feature aims to uncover industry-specific practices or risks affecting creditworthiness.

3. <CitizenDriverLicenseInteraction><cross><Citizen><DriversLicense><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_citizenship_status_and_possession_of_a_driver's_license,_which_may_reflect_personal_stability_and_mobility_implications_for_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: This feature explores the relationship between citizenship status (Citizen) and having a driver's license (DriversLicense), potentially revealing information about a person's stability and mobility, which can influence credit decisions.

2026-01-30 16:02:08,551 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features, aiming to enhance the downstream model's performance:

1. DebtToIncomeBankCustomerInteraction
   -  <DebtToIncomeBankCustomerInteraction><cross><DebtIncomeRatio><BankCustomer><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_the_debt_to_income_ratio_and_being_a_bank_customer,indicating_how_financial_stability_relates_to_existing_banking_relationships_and_their_influence_on_credit_approval> 
   - Reasoning: This feature combines financial metrics with banking relationships, suggesting how existing banking ties may impact financial stability evaluation.

2. IncomeNormalized
   -  <IncomeNormalized><zscore><Income><This_feature_standardizes_income_by_calculating_a_z_score,_helping_to_make_income_data_comparable_across_individuals_and_reducing_the_impact_of_extreme_values> 
   - Reasoning: This normalization may mitigate the impact of income variability, making the feature more robust and improving comparability across different data points.

3. EmployedYearsDriverLicenseInteraction
   -  <EmployedYearsDriverLicenseInteraction><cross><EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction><DriversLicense><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_stability_and_having_a_driver's_license,which_may_captivate_long-term_stability_and_responsibility_through_employment_duration_and_possession_of_a_license> 
   - Reasoning: By linking employment duration with possession of a driver’s license, this feature might capture aspects of long-term stability and personal responsibility, which are valuable in assessing creditworthiness.

2026-01-30 16:02:14,744 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, let's focus on creating meaningful features by interacting and transforming existing features. Here are three proposed steps with reasoning:

1. <NormalizedIncomeDebtRatio><zscore><IncomeDebtInteraction><This_feature_standardizes_the_interaction_between_income_and_debt,aiming_to_reduce_the_effect_of_outliers_and_make_it_comparable_across_individuals_for_better_creditworthiness_insights>  
   - Reasoning: By applying a z-score to the IncomeDebtInteraction, we standardize this feature to account for variability and extreme values. This can help the model better discern the relationship between income, debt, and creditworthiness.

2. <IndustryBalancedDebt><cross><Industry><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry_and_debt_to_income_ratio,capturing_industry-specific_financial_risk_patterns_and_their_effect_on_credit_approval_decisions>  
   - Reasoning: The interaction between Industry and DebtIncomeRatio can provide insights into how different industries manage financial risk relative to income and debt. This feature might help the model capture specific patterns associated with certain industries.

3. <EmployedDriverLicenseFeature><concat><Employed><DriversLicense><This_feature_combines_employment_status_with_driving_license_possession,highlighting_stability_and_responsibility_traits_that_may_influence_creditworthiness>  
   - Reasoning: Concatenating Employed and DriversLicense captures a combined effect of employment status and license possession, which could indicate a potential for greater stability and responsibility, factors likely to affect credit success.

These steps aim to create features that provide additional perspectives on the existing data to improve model predictions.

2026-01-30 16:02:21,577 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features that could potentially improve the predictive performance of the downstream model for predicting credit card application success:

1. <IncomeMarriedRatio><divide><Income><Married><This_feature_represents_the_ratio_of_income_to_marital_status,highlighting_financial_capacity_relative_to_marital_commitments>
   - Reasoning: This feature attempts to measure financial capacity and stability within the context of marital responsibilities. Married individuals might share financial responsibilities which could influence creditworthiness. This ratio could indicate how income supports these commitments, providing insight into financial resilience.

2. <IndustryCreditRiskInteraction><cross><Industry><PriorDefault><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_the_industry_and_prior_default_status,indicating_how_specific_industries_might_be_with_credit_risk_based_on_historical_defaults>
   - Reasoning: By combining industry and prior default status, this feature seeks to capture potential patterns or risks associated with specific sectors. Some industries might have higher default risks due to economic cycles, job stability, or sector-specific challenges.

3. <CitizenBankCustomerInteraction><cross><Citizen><BankCustomer><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_citizenship_status_and_bank_relationships,capturing_citizen-related_financial_network_accessibilities_and_stabilities>
   - Reasoning: This interaction feature might reveal how citizenship status affects access to and stability with financial institutions. A strong bank-customer relationship could indicate a more stable financial life, and this could potentially vary with citizenship status.

   - Reasoning: An applicant's citizenship status might influence the perception of credit risk, especially if they have a history of prior default. Exploring this interaction could reveal patterns in credit approvals affected by both factors combined.

2. <DebtIncomeNormalized><minmax><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_applies_min-max_normalization_to_the_debt_to_income_ratio,_reducing_the_effect_of_extreme_values_while_keeping_the_feature_bounded_below_and_above,_which_could_improve_model_performance_by_standardizing_this_metric_across_individuals>
   - Reasoning: Min-max normalization can help address the extreme range and skewness of the debt-to-income ratio, potentially improving the comparability of this feature across different individuals and consequently improving how models use it.

3. <EmployedYearsCitizenInteraction><cross><EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_stability_and_citizenship,_potentially_highlighting_long-term_financial_stability_and_cultural_factors_that_influence_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Combining employment stability with citizenship status may capture underlying factors related to long-term financial stability and socio-cultural circumstances that can affect credit approval decisions.

2026-01-30 16:02:38,543 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the dataset and previous feature engineering attempts, let's consider three new possible features:

1. DebtIncomeSigmoidInteraction: Given the skewness and potentially extreme values in the DebtIncomeRatio, applying a sigmoid transformation could scale this feature between 0 and 1, potentially improving the prediction reliability. This transformation will allow interactions with other features, balancing the impact of extreme ratios.

   
   <DebtIncomeSigmoidInteraction><sigmoid><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_applies_a_sigmoid_transformation_to_smooth_out_extreme_values,_making_the_debt_to_income_ratio_more_comparable_across_cases,_potentially_improving_model_performance>
   

2. IndustryMarriedCross: A cross-feature between Industry and Married may capture specific demographic insights revealing how marital status affects credit approval across different industries - for instance, an industry with unstable employment might rely more heavily on marital status for credit approvals.

   
   <IndustryMarriedCross><cross><Industry><Married><This_feature_represents_an_interaction_between_industry_and_maritat_status,_capturing_sector-specific_demographic_trends_affecting_creditworthiness>
   

3. EmployedIncomeRatio: Creating a ratio of EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction to Income may reveal insights into how the length of employment relative to income level affects creditworthiness, providing a holistic view of financial stability. This can uncover potential mismatches between long-term employment and income.

   
   <EmployedIncomeRatio><divide><EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction><Income><This_feature_represents_the_ratio_of_employment_stability_to_income,_indicating_how_length_of_employment_relates_to_financial_capability_based_on_income_levels>
   

These features attempt to capture different aspects of financial behavior and stability, potentially offering more nuanced indicators of creditworthiness for predicting credit card application success.

2026-01-30 16:02:50,320 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps to generate new features aimed at improving the model's performance in predicting credit card application success:

1. DebtIncomeCubed  
   <DebtIncomeCubed><cube><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_applies_a_cubic_transformation_to_DebtIncomeRatio,accentuating_large_values_and_potentially_improving_the_feature's_influence_on_credit_decisions>

   *Reasoning*: The DebtIncomeRatio has a very high range and variance, indicating potential influence by outliers or significant skewness. Cubing this feature may emphasize extreme values, capturing more information about high debt-to-income scenarios that can better distinguish successful applications.

2. IncomeCitizenCross  
   <IncomeCitizenCross><cross><Income><Citizen><This_feature_represents_an_interaction_between_income_and_citizenship_status_highlighting_how_income_socioeconomic_factors_may_vary_based_on_citizenship_and_impact_creditworthiness>

   *Reasoning*: Interactions between income and citizenship can reflect socio-economic stability and access to resources that are relevant for credit approval. Combining these features, therefore, may uncover patterns specific to certain citizenship categories that affect successful outcomes.

3. EmployedDebInteraction  
   <EmployedDebtInteraction><multiply><Employed><Debt><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status_and_outstanding_debt,might_highlight_the_financial_stress_level_of_employed_applicants_who_must_handle_debt,_potentially_improving_credit_assessment>

   *Reasoning*: Employment, combined with debt levels, reflects an individual's financial burden while managing income through employment. This interaction could reveal insights into the creditworthiness of employed individuals carrying different debt loads, distinguishing those more likely to meet credit approval requirements.

2026-01-30 16:02:57,353 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeMarriedInteraction><cross><Income><Married><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_income_and_marital_status_which_could_capture_how_marital_status_affects_financial_responsibilities_or_benefits,providing_insights_into_creditworthiness_based_on_personal_life_stability>
   - Reasoning: Marital status might affect financial obligations and benefits. This feature could help understand the impact of marital status on an individual's financial management, potentially influencing creditworthiness.

2. <DebtIncomeZScore><zscore><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_standardizes_the_debt_to_income_ratio_by_converting_it_to_a_z-score,_reducing_the_impact_of_extreme_values_and_making_the_ratio_more_comparable_across_individuals>
   - Reasoning: The Debt to Income Ratio has a significantly large range and mean. Standardizing it by calculating a z-score can reduce the impact of extreme values, leading to more consistent modeling outcomes and comparability across samples.

3. <EmployedCitizenInteraction><cross><Employed><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status_and_citizenship,status_to_capture_combined_effects_of_being_employed_and_citizenship_on_creditworthiness,considering_stability_and_eligibility_in_financial_sectors>
   - Reasoning: Citizenship may offer various benefits or limitations regarding employment and creditworthiness. Combining employment status and citizenship can help uncover patterns in how these two factors together influence a person's credit application success.

2026-01-30 16:03:07,610 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate features, utilizing the available operations and existing dataset features. The aim is to create features that could likely improve the model's ability to predict credit card application success:

1. Understanding Relationship between Employment and Financial Capacity:
   - <EmployedDebtResponsibility><multiply><Employed><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status_and_the_debt_to_income_ratio,capturing_how_employment_acts_as_a_stabilizing_factor_for_high_debt-to-income_ratios,which_might_indicate_creditworthiness_due_to_responsible_management_of_high_ratios>

   *Reasoning*: By combining employment status with the debt-to-income ratio, this feature could highlight individuals who handle high financial burdens responsibly due to stable employment, an indicative factor of creditworthiness.

2. Highlighting Combined Citizenship and Geographic Benefits:
   - <CitizenZipCodeInteraction><cross><Citizen><ZipCode><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_citizenship_status_and_zip_code_location,indicating_community_benefits_or_challenges_based_on_legal_status_and_geographic_factors,_potentially_affecting_creditworthiness>

   *Reasoning*: The interaction between citizenship and geographic location could capture socio-economic and legal advantages or disadvantages, affecting an individual's access to financial resources and creditworthiness.

3. Capturing the Influence of Industry and Income on Debt Management:
   - <IndustryIncomeDebtManagement><cross><Industry><IncomeDebtInteraction><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry_and_income-to-debt_interaction,capturing_industry-specific_patterns_in_how_income_levels_affect_debt_management_ability_and_thus_influence_credit_approval>

   *Reasoning*: This feature could reveal how individuals within certain industries manage their income and debt, potentially uncovering industry-linked financial management styles that influence credit risk.

2. Feature: Citizenship and Debt Management Interaction  
   This feature captures the interplay between an individual's citizenship status and their debt management capability. It may indicate how different citizenship populations manage debts and interact with financial systems, affecting credit approval.

2026-01-30 16:03:27,129 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST  "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

2026-01-30 16:03:27,131 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operations:

1.  
 
<NormalizedIncome><zscore><Income><This_feature_standardizes_income_by_converting_it_to_a_z-score,_making_it_comparable_across_individuals_and_reducing_the_impact_of_outliers> 
  
Reasoning: The Income feature is highly skewed and standardized through Z-score normalization may enhance model performance by making income data more comparable among individuals.

2.  
 
<DebtIncomeRatioNormalized><log><DebtIncomeRatio><This_feature_transforms_the_debt_to_income_ratio_to_a_log_scale_to_handle_extreme_values_and_reduce_skewness,_improving_the_feature's_influence_on_credit_decisions>
  
Reasoning: Transforming the DebtIncomeRatio to a logarithmic scale can mitigate the effect of outliers and reduce skewness, potentially improving the model's ability to understand financial stress impacts.

3.  
 
<IndustryCitizenInteraction><cross><Industry><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry_and_citizenship_status,_highlighting_socioeconomic_trends_and_sector-specific_risks_which_could_impact_creditworthiness> 

Reasoning: Capturing the interaction between Industry and Citizen status could unveil sector-specific risks related to citizenship effects on job stability, providing insights into creditworthiness by considering both economic sectors and socio-demographic factors.

2026-01-30 16:03:32,970 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<IncomeDebtResponsibilityRatio\>\<divide\>\<IncomeDebtInteraction\>\<EmployedDebtResponsibility\>\<This_feature_represents_the_ratio_between_income_and_debt_responsibility,highlighting_how_income_relates_to_responsible_debt_management_for_those_with_high_debt-to-income_ratios_which_might_indicate_creditworthiness\>
   - This feature aims to combine the concepts of income and responsible debt management under employment to identify individuals who might be better at handling debt based on their employment status and income levels.

2. \<NormalizedAgeCreditScoreRatio\>\<zscore\>\<AgeCreditScoreRatio\>\<This_feature_standardizes_the_age_to_credit_score_ratio_by_calculating_a_z-score,_which_may_help_identify_outliers_and_make_the_feature_comparable_across_different_individuals,_potentially_improving_creditworthiness_prediction\>
   - By normalizing the Age Credit Score Ratio using a z-score, this feature reduces the impact of outliers and makes it more comparable across instances, which could improve the model's ability to discern patterns impacting credit approval.

3. \<IndustryCreditDefaultRisk\>\<cross\>\<Industry\>\<PriorDefault\>\<This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_industry_and_prior_default_status,_indicating_how_specific_industries_may_influence_credit_risks_associated_with_historical_defaults,_highlighting_potential_risk_trends_that_could_affect_credit_card_application_success\>
   - This feature highlights how prior defaults intersect with industry types, potentially revealing industry-specific risk trends in defaults that could influence creditworthiness and impact credit approval decisions.

2026-01-30 16:03:40,491 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations:

1. <MarriedCitizenInteraction><cross><Married><Citizen><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_marital_status_and_citizenship,which_may_capture_sociodemographic_factors_affecting_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Combining marital status with citizenship might reveal sociocultural factors that affect financial behavior and consequently creditworthiness.

2. <DebtIncomeAgeInteraction><multiply><DebtIncomeRatio><AgeCreditScoreRatio><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_debt_to_income_ratio_and_age_to_credit_score_ratio,capturing_how_financial_stress_and_age-related_creditworthiness_together_influence_the_probability_of_credit_approval>
   - Reasoning: This feature attempts to capture financial stress (debt to income) coupled with age-related credit behavior, which may provide insights into the risk propensity of older versus younger individuals under financial stress.

3. <EmployedIncomeResponsibility><multiply><Employed><Income><This_feature_represents_the_interaction_between_employment_status_and_income,_indicating_how_stability_through_employment_correlates_with_financial_capacity_to_manage_income,_which_might_suggest_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By combining employment status with income, the feature could indicate financial capacity and stability, thus presenting a more comprehensive picture of an applicant’s financial reliability and potential creditworthiness.
