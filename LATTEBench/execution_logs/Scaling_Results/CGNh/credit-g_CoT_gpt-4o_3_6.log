   - Reasoning: Evaluating the ratio between credit amount and years of residence could provide insights into an individual's financial stability relative to how long they've been residing in a location. Longer residence may indicate greater stability, which is relevant when assessing credit risk.

2. <duration_existing_credits_interaction><cross><duration><existing_credits><Interaction_feature_capturing_the_combined_effect_of_credit_duration_and_number_of_existing_credits_potentially_indicating_borrowing_behavior_and_risk_management>
   - Reasoning: This interaction could highlight patterns in credit behavior, such as whether longer credit durations are associated with fewer existing credits, potentially suggesting a more aggressive borrowing strategy or the opposite.

3. <savings_credit_history_interaction><cross><savings_status><credit_history><Interaction_feature_capturing_the_combined_effect_of_savings_status_and_credit_history_potentially_indicating_financial_behavior_and_risk>
   - Reasoning: Combining savings status with credit history can unveil patterns in financial management and risk profiles. Applicants with robust savings but unfavorable credit histories might pose different risks than those with solid credit histories and minimal savings.

Reasoning: This feature represents a normalized measure of how the amount of credit requested relates to the duration for which it is requested. Normalizing these values can help to better understand patterns and improve predictions of credit approval, as it provides a scale-independent representation of borrowing strategy.

2. <savings_status_existing_credits_cross><cross><savings_status><existing_credits><Interaction of savings status and number of existing credits, potentially indicating financial behavior and risk management based on availability of savings and active credits>

Reasoning: This feature captures the combination of savings account status and the number of existing credits, which can provide insights into an individual's financial behavior and risk management. Understanding how these categorical factors interact could improve the prediction of credit approval.

3. <checking_residence_cross><cross><checking_status><residence_since><Combination of checking account status and residence duration, potentially indicating stability and reliability in financial behavior>

Reasoning: Combining checking account status with residence duration creates a feature that can reflect an individual's reliability and financial behavior. An applicant with a stable checking account status and longer residence duration is often seen as more stable, potentially improving credit prediction accuracy.

1. <credit_amount_checking_status_cross><cross><credit_amount><checking_status_encoded><Interaction_feature_capturing_the_combined_effect_of_credit_amount_and_checking_account_status_potentially_highlighting_liquidity_and_credit_risk_in_relation_to_requested_credits>  
   - Reasoning: Combining the credit amount with the numerical checking account status provides a feature that may reveal nuanced insights into an applicant's current liquidity and the risk posed by their credit request. 

2. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Numerical_representation_of_savings_account_status_for_improved_model_input>  
   - Reasoning: Converting the categorical savings status into numerical form can make it more digestible for most machine learning algorithms, potentially improving the model's ability to discern patterns related to savings behavior and credit risk.

3. <residence_credit_amount_ratio><divide><residence_since><credit_amount><Ratio_of_years_of_residence_to_credit_amount_requested_indicating_stability_in_residential_duration_relative_to_the_magnitude_of_borrowing_which_may_reflect_risk>  
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the applicant’s stability with respect to how much credit they are requesting, which might indicate a lower risk if an applicant with longer residency is requesting less credit. 

These steps are designed to enhance the model's understanding of applicant risk by creating features that consider both the financial and demographic aspects of the data.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the ratio between the credit amount and the savings status. An individual with lower savings asking for a high credit amount might be riskier, thus providing an additional signal for assessing credit risk.

2. <duration_checking_status_cross><cross><duration><checking_status_encoded><Interaction_feature_capturing_the_combined_effect_of_credit_duration_and_checking_account_status_potentially_indicating_credit_risk_and_liquidity>

   Reasoning: By crossing the credit duration with the checking account status, we can identify patterns where longer credit terms might correlate with specific checking status, indicating risk levels.

3. <foreign_worker_credit_amount_ratio><divide><credit_amount><foreign_worker><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_foreign_worker_status_highlighting_relationship_between_borrowing_amount_and_employment_status>

   Reasoning: This feature considers the influence of being a foreign worker on the credit amount. Foreign workers might have different credit behavior or risk profiles compared to domestic workers, providing valuable insights for credit approval prediction.

1. <savings_personal_cross><cross><savings_status_encoded><personal_status><Interaction feature capturing the combined effect of savings account status and personal status, potentially indicating financial stability tied to sociodemographic factors>  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between a person's savings behavior and their demographic profile, which can give insights into their financial stability and creditworthiness, improving prediction accuracy.

2. <duration_foreign_cross><cross><duration><foreign_worker><Interaction feature capturing the combined effect of credit duration and foreign worker status, potentially indicating risk associated with credit length and worker's residency>  
   Reasoning: This feature helps assess the relationship between the length of credit and the applicant's residency status, which might reveal trends in credit approvals based on how residency affects perceived stability and reliability.

3. <credit_amount_other_parties_cross><cross><credit_amount><other_parties><Interaction feature capturing the combined effect of credit amount and presence of other debtors/guarantors, potentially indicating shared credit risk and financial support>  
   Reasoning: This feature addresses how the requested credit amount relates to the presence of other financial parties involved, indicating the potential distribution of credit risk and the presence of additional financial support.

These features are engineered to capture complex interactions and provide enriched information to the model, aiming to enhance prediction capabilities by addressing financial behaviors and demographic influences on credit approval.

   Reasoning: Applying a log transformation to the credit amount can help normalize its distribution, especially given its large range and high mean. This transformation can improve the robustness and accuracy of predictive models, particularly in linear models sensitive to skewed distributions.

2. \<credit_duration_personal_cross\>\<cross\>\<duration\>\<personal_status\>\<Interaction_feature_combining_credit_duration_and_personal_status_to_identify_trends_in_credit_behavior_and_potential_risks_associated_with_term_length_based_on_sociodemographics\>

   Reasoning: By crossing the duration with personal status, we can capture potential patterns or risks that certain sociocultural groups might exhibit in their credit behavior relative to the length of the credit term. This could highlight differences in borrowing strategies or preferences, potentially revealing unique risk factors.

3. \<savings_status_checking_status_concat\>\<concat\>\<savings_status_encoded\>\<checking_status_encoded\>\<Combined_encoded_feature_to_capture_overall_financial_liquidity_and_behavior_for_richer_insights\>

   Reasoning: Concatenating the encoded versions of savings and checking status provides a combined view of an individual's financial liquidity and behavior. This feature can highlight variations in financial behavior and stability effectively when numeric representations of categorical variables are combined. It can reveal unique patterns not evident when each status is considered independently.

2026-01-30 15:54:46,979 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential steps to generate new features:

1. <credit_amount_savings_status_ratio><divide><credit_amount><savings_status_encoded><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_status_encoded_highlighting_the_relationship_between_requested_credit_and_financial_savings_stability>
   - Reasoning: This feature could provide insights into an individual's financial liquidity and risk management by examining how the amount they request compares to their savings status. A lower ratio may indicate better financial stability and a lower credit risk.

2. <duration_credit_amount_log_ratio><divide><duration><credit_amount_log><Ratio_of_credit_duration_to_logged_credit_amount_offering_insights_into_the_borrowing_strategy_and_risk_associated_with_the_length_of_loan_relative_to_the_size_of_the_request>
   - Reasoning: By comparing the duration of the credit to the log-transformed credit amount, this feature can reveal the borrowing strategy of the individual. A longer duration for a smaller requested amount may imply a risk-averse strategy, whereas a shorter duration for a larger amount could indicate higher risk, potentially influencing credit decisions.

3. <credit_history_other_parties_cross><cross><credit_history><other_parties><Interaction_feature_capturing_combined_effect_of_credit_history_and_presence_of_other_debtors/guarantors,_providing_insights_into_shared_risk_and_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By examining the combined effect of credit history and the presence of other parties involved (guarantors or co-applicants), this feature could help determine the shared credit risk and possibly indicate a higher likelihood of approval due to shared financial support.

2026-01-30 15:54:53,874 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features using the operations:

1. Create an Interaction Feature Between Foreign Worker Status and Savings Status
   - <foreign_savings_cross><cross><foreign_worker><savings_status><Interaction_feature_combining_foreign_worker_status_and_savings_status_potentially_indicating_sociodemographic_financial_behavior_trends>  
   - Reasoning: By examining the interaction between foreign worker status and savings status, this feature could help to capture any sociocultural differences affecting financial behavior and creditworthiness. This interaction may reveal insights into how foreign workers manage savings differently compared to domestic workers, highlighting credit risk profiles.

2. Log Transformation of Credit Duration for Reducing Skewness
   - <credit_duration_log><log><duration><Log_transformation_of_credit_duration_to_handle_skewed_distribution_and_improve_model_performance>  
   - Reasoning: Log transformation is commonly applied to reduce skewness in continuous variables. This feature might achieve a more normal distribution of credit duration, offering enhanced stability and focusing capability in the model by managing the effect of higher credit durations.

3. Create a Combined Financial Stability Feature Using Checking and Savings Status
   - <combined_financial_stability><concat><checking_status_encoded><savings_status_encoded><Combined_encoded_feature_to_indicate_overall_financial_stability_by_combining_checking_and_savings_status>  
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the overall financial liquidity and stability by integrating checking and savings account information. It allows the model to consider both types of financial account statuses collectively, which could better reflect the applicant's holistic financial behavior and credit risk.

2026-01-30 15:55:01,365 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three recommended steps to generate new features, leveraging available operations and existing features. These steps aim to improve the downstream model's performance by capturing nuanced interactions and providing richer data insights.

1. <savings_status_foreign_worker_cross><cross><savings_status><foreign_worker><Interaction_feature_capturing_the_combined_effect_of_savings_status_and_foreign_worker_status_potentially_indicating_sociodemographic_and_financial_risk_trends_in_credit_approval>
   - Reasoning: Combining savings status with foreign worker status can provide insights into how savings influence credit approval differently for domestic vs. foreign individuals, which could be critical in assessing financial risk associated with sociodemographic factors.

2. <duration_credit_amount_ratio><divide><duration><credit_amount_log><Ratio_of_credit_duration_to_logged_credit_amount_providing_insights_into_borrowing_strategy_related_to_loan_length_and_magnitude_after_outlier_handling>
   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio of credit duration to logged credit amount helps evaluate the borrowing strategy by relating the length of the credit to its magnitude, with skewness and outliers managed due to the log transformation.

3. <credit_history_savings_cross><cross><credit_history><savings_status><Interaction_feature_combining_credit_history_and_savings_status_potentially_highlighting_behavioral_risk_patterns_related_to_credit_and_financial_liquidity>
   - Reasoning: The interplay between credit history and savings status is informative for risk assessment, providing a composite view of financial behavior and stability or instability patterns which can be leveraged to strengthen the prediction model.

2026-01-30 15:55:06,612 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the downstream model's performance, we need to identify possible relationships between features and effectively transform or combine them. Here's a proposed list of three new features:

1. <credit_amount_savings_status_ratio><divide><credit_amount><savings_status_encoded><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_status_encoded_highlighting_the_dynamics_between_requested_credit_and_financial_liquidity>
   - Reasoning: This feature can provide insights into how the amount of credit requested correlates with the individual's savings status. A high ratio may indicate a higher risk if the savings are low compared to the credit requested.

2. <personal_status_foreign_worker_cross><cross><personal_status><foreign_worker><Interaction_feature_identifier_capturing_demographic_and_immigration_status_interactions_on_credit_approval>
   - Reasoning: Combining personal status and foreign worker status could reveal interesting patterns or biases in credit approvals based on demographic and immigration status, which may be overlooked when these features are considered separately.

3. <credit_history_checking_status_encoded><label_encode><credit_history><Numerical_representation_of_credit_history_for_improved_model_input_in_combination_with_checking_status>
   - Reasoning: By converting credit_history into numeric form, we allow for direct numerical interactions or comparisons with other numeric features, such as checking_status_encoded. This labeling can help enhance understanding of credit behavior and risk.

2026-01-30 15:55:11,990 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three feature engineering steps designed to potentially improve the downstream model's performance. Each step includes a brief explanation of the underlying reasoning:

1. Cross Feature of Savings and Personal Status:
   - <savings_personal_status_cross><cross><savings_status_encoded><personal_status><Interaction feature combining savings account status and personal status to potentially capture sociodemographic and financial behavior trends in credit risk>
   - Reasoning: Combining savings status with personal status could reveal insights into how different demographic profiles manage savings, providing additional context for credit risk assessment.

2. Standardized Credit Duration:
   - <scaled_duration_zscore><zscore><duration><Standardized credit duration indicating how the requested term length varies from the mean, providing insights into typical vs. atypical credit request durations>
   - Reasoning: Z-score standardization will help identify if the credit duration significantly deviates from the average, highlighting potential risk associated with unusually short or long credit durations.

3. Group Mean Savings by Credit History:
   - <avg_savings_by_credit_history><groupbythenmean><credit_history><savings_status_encoded><Average savings status for each credit history category, providing insights into typical savings behavior in different credit risk contexts>
   - Reasoning: By calculating the average savings status for each credit history category, we can identify trends in savings patterns associated with specific credit behaviors, improving the understanding of financial stability.

These operations are designed to extract more nuanced patterns from the data, which could enhance the predictive capability of the model.

2026-01-30 15:55:19,708 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Sociodemographic Risk Indicator  
   We aim to capture the combined effect of personal status and savings behavior, potentially offering insights into trends in financial behavior tied to sociodemographic factors. This can help in understanding how personal status impacts financial stability and risk.

   
   <personal_savings_status_cross><cross><personal_status><savings_status_encoded><Interaction_feature_that_combines_personal_status_and_savings_status_encoded_to_insight_financial_behavior_and_credit_risk>
   

2. Temporal Credit Behavior Trend  
   Understanding the influence of credit duration in relation to the outcomes of past credit behavior is crucial. Creating a feature that captures the ratio of credit duration to credit history can provide insights into how historical borrowing behaviors align with current credit requests.

   
   <credit_duration_history_ratio><divide><duration><credit_history_checking_status_cross><Ratio_of_credit_duration_to_credit_history_cross,indicating_borrowing_behavior_and_outcome_aligned_to_duration>
   

3. Risk-Sharing Financial Stability Indicator  
   This feature intends to explore the combined influence of foreign worker status and the presence of other debtors/guarantors on credit risk, potentially highlighting shared risk scenarios and financial support extent.

   
   <foreign_worker_other_parties_cross><cross><foreign_worker><other_parties><Combined_effect_of_foreign_worker_status_and_other_debtors,potentially_reflecting_shared_risk_and_financial_support_in_borrowing_scenarios>
   


### Rationale

1. Sociodemographic Risk Indicator: By crossing personal_status with savings_status_encoded, we could identify patterns where certain personal demographics, in relation to their savings behavior, consistently exhibit financial stability or risk. This could be a decisive factor in credit decisions.

2. Temporal Credit Behavior Trend: By calculating the ratio of credit duration to the interaction of credit history and checking status (credit_history_checking_status_cross), we're effectively assessing the risk associated with long-term borrowing for individuals with specific past credit outcomes. This can be particularly insightful in highlighting inconsistencies or riskier borrowing strategies.

3. Risk-Sharing Financial Stability Indicator: Foreign workers may have different credit patterns, especially when there are other debtors or guarantors involved. Crossing these features can reveal whether foreign workers tend to share risk more frequently and identify potential support networks that reduce financial risk.

2026-01-30 15:55:30,469 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 5415, 'completion_tokens': 295, 'total_tokens': 5710}
2026-01-30 15:55:30,469 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating features:

1. <credit_amount_normalized><minmax><credit_amount><Normalized_credit_amount_feature_indicating_the_relative_amount_requested_by_applicants>

   Reasoning: Normalizing the credit amount can help mitigate issues with outliers and scale differences, potentially improving model performance by ensuring consistent input magnitudes across different features. This is particularly useful in models where gradient descent optimization is involved.

2. <personal_status_savings_cross><cross><personal_status><savings_status_encoded><Interaction_feature_combining_personal_status_and_encoded_savings_status_to_explore_potential_relationships_between_sociodemographic_factors_and_financial_liquidity>

   Reasoning: This feature aims to capture complex interactions between personal demographics and financial behavior, which might highlight trends and risk factors related to credit approval. This can provide richer insights that are potentially missing when these features are analyzed independently.

3. <credit_duration_zscore><zscore><duration><Standardized_credit_duration_calculating_the_number_of_standard_deviations_a_duration_value_is_away_from_the_mean_to_better_handle_varied_term_lengths>

   Reasoning: Calculating the z-score for credit duration will help in identifying outliers and understanding how each input duration differs substantially from the mean. This could improve model robustness by treating typical and atypical loan requests more distinctly. This approach is beneficial in contexts where duration variability impacts risk assessment.
