2026-01-30 15:57:05,221 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the dataset characteristics and the accepted/rejected features so far, we'll focus on generating features that might enhance the model's ability to predict credit card application success. The goal is to find interactions or transformations that encapsulate meaningful relationships, which could be indicative of successful applications.

1. <EmployedDriverLicenseBankAccount><cross><EmployedWithDriverLicense><BankCustomer><Combined_effect_of_employment_driver_license_and_bank_account_status_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Individuals who are employed, have a driver's license, and maintain a bank account might have greater financial mobility and stability. This interaction captures multiple facets of personal responsibility and financial handling, potentially indicating reliability in credit card repayments.

2. <PriorDefaultDebtInteraction><cross><PriorDefault><DebtToIncomeRatio><Impact_of_prior_default_and_financial_burden_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: People with prior defaults might have different financial behaviors, affecting their debt-to-income management. This feature combines historical default data with current financial burden, providing insights into their current risk profile and potential ability to manage new credit.

3. <EmployedYearsEmployedZscore><zscore><YearsEmployed><Standardized_duration_of_employment_as_a_normalized_measure_of_work_stability_for_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Years employed reflect the duration of financial stability and income. Using z-score standardization enhances this metric's sensitivity across varying employment lengths, making it easier to detect anomalies or strength in employment history that's indicative of creditworthiness. Applying it after employment status can highlight reliable workers who have longer histories of stable employment.

2026-01-30 15:57:16,715 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly, here are three proposed steps for generating new features to potentially enhance the prediction model's performance. These steps are aimed at capturing complex relationships or alternative views of existing features:

1. CreditScoreEmployedInteraction: This feature will leverage the CreditScore and Employed features to understand how being employed in combination with creditworthiness affects credit card application success.
   plaintext
   <CreditScoreEmployedInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><Employed><Impact_of_credit_score_and_employment_status_on_credit_card_application_success>
   

2. CitizenDebtToIncomeRatio: By taking into consideration the different citizenship statuses, we can understand how these might impact the financial burden borne from the debt-to-income ratio.
   plaintext
   <CitizenDebtToIncomeRatio><cross><Citizen><DebtToIncomeRatio><Interaction_between_citizenship_and_financial_burden_on_creditworthiness>
   

3. IncomeStabilityIndicator: This feature aims to capture stability by combining employment status and years of employment. Individuals who are both employed and have a long history of employment may have a higher likelihood of being successful in credit card applications.
   plaintext
   <IncomeStabilityIndicator><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Combined_effect_of_employment_and_employment_history_on_credit_card_success>
   

### Reasoning:
1. CreditScoreEmployedInteraction: This feature will identify if higher credit scores are especially beneficial for employed individuals when applying for credit cards.

2. CitizenDebtToIncomeRatio: Considering that some citizenship statuses may face different socioeconomic challenges, this interaction monitors how different debt-to-income ratios manifest among different citizenship categories.

3. IncomeStabilityIndicator: Stability and consistency in employment are strong indicators of reliability from a lender's perspective. Combining employment status with tenure provides a clearer picture of an individual's income stability.

These features are designed to reflect potentially nonlinear interactions and categorical influences on financial behavior, which may not be captured by simpler linear models.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between prior defaults and credit score, which are significant indicators of creditworthiness. Combining these features might help identify applicants with a history of prior defaults but improved credit scores that might influence their success in applying for credit.

2. \<StabilityIndicator\><multiply><YearsEmployed><Employed>\<Combined_effect_of_years_employed_and_employment_status_on_credit_card_application_success>

   Reasoning: Employment stability and history are crucial factors in credit card application success. Multiplying YearsEmployed and Employed creates a stability indicator that strengthens the evaluation of an applicant's work stability, which can influence their credit decision.

3. \<CitizenWithDebtProfile\><cross><Citizen><DebtToIncomeRatio>\<Interaction_of_citizenship_status_and_financial_burden_on_creditworthiness>

   Reasoning: Citizenship status may impact financial opportunities and obligations, while DebtToIncomeRatio reflects financial burden relative to income. By crossing these features, we can discern patterns in credit application success related to citizenship's influence on financial behavior.

2026-01-30 15:57:30,227 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to improve predictions regarding credit card application success:

1. <DebtToIncomeRatioLogTransform><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Logarithmic_transformation_to_reduce_skewness_and_stabilize_variance_for_credit_card_application_success>
   - Applying a logarithmic transformation to DebtToIncomeRatio may help stabilize variance and reduce skewness. Given the wide range of values, this can potentially improve how the feature is interpreted by the model.

2. <YearsEmployedCategoricalBin><bin><YearsEmployed><Categorizing_years_employed_in_bins_to_represent_employment_stability_levels>
   - Creating categorical bins from YearsEmployed can represent levels of employment stability. This transformation may capture the non-linear relationships between employment duration and credit card application success.

3. <PriorDefaultEmployedInteraction><cross><PriorDefault><Employed><Impact_of_prior_default_status_and_employment_status_combined_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Cross the PriorDefault and Employed features to explore the interaction effect between prior default status and current employment on success rates in credit card applications. This could uncover combined impacts that aren't captured when looking at these features individually.

These feature engineering steps aim to create new representations that could capture complex relationships in the data, making for more informed predictive modeling.

2026-01-30 15:57:34,683 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. <CreditScoreByEmploymentYears><divide><CreditScore><YearsEmployed><Ratio_of_credit_score_by_years_employed_as_an_indicator_of_creditworthiness_relative_to_stability>  
   Reasoning: This feature combines the credit score and years of employment to gauge how consistent and reliable the applicant is in maintaining their credit score relative to their work history, which can be a good predictor of creditworthiness.

2. <EmployedWithCitizenInteraction><cross><Employed><Citizen><Effect_of_employment_status_and_citizenship_on_credit_card_application_success>  
   Reasoning: By creating an interaction between employment status and citizenship status, this feature aims to capture how the combination of these two factors affects the likelihood of credit card application success. Citizenship status combined with employment can provide insights into stability and integration.

3. <MarriedDebtToIncomeInteraction><multiply><Married><DebtToIncomeRatio><Effect_of_marital_status_on_financial_burden_as_measured_by_debt_to_income_ratio>  
   Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the potential impact of being married on financial management by looking at how marriage might influence financial burden. Marital status could affect household income and debt responsibilities, potentially impacting credit card application success.

These features are designed to explore interactions and ratios that have not been previously considered, with the aim of uncovering underlying patterns that could improve the predictive power of the model.

1. <CreditScoreDriverLicenseInteraction><cross><CreditScore><DriversLicense><Combined_effect_of_credit_score_and_having_drivers_license_on_credit_card_application_success>

   *Reasoning*: Combining credit score with the driver's license status might help depict the financial responsibility of the person, as having a driver's license might indicate increased reliability in handling credit. 

2. <EmployedDebtToIncomeRatioInteraction><multiply><Employed><DebtToIncomeRatio><Impact_of_employment_status_with_debt_to_income_ratio_on_credit_card_application_success>

   *Reasoning*: Multiplying employment status with the debt-to-income ratio might amplify the financial burden or stability impact a person's current employment status has, giving insight into their likelihood of approval.

3. <CitizenEthnicityInteraction><cross><Citizen><Ethnicity><Interaction_between_citizenship_and_ethnicity_to_assess_impact_on_credit_card_application_success>

   *Reasoning*: The interaction between citizenship status and ethnicity may capture sociocultural factors or biases that could affect credit card application success rates, potentially uncovering hidden patterns not observed with individual indicators.

2026-01-30 15:58:07,677 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. <CitizenBankCustomerCross><cross><Citizen><BankCustomer><Combined_effect_of_citizenship_status_and_bank_account_ownership_on_credit_card_application_success>  
   Reasoning: Explore the interaction between citizenship status and bank account ownership, as different citizenship statuses might have varied access or requirements for bank accounts, influencing credit card application success.

2. <EmployedDebtRatioLogTransform><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Logarithmic_transformation_of_debt_to_income_ratio_for_employed_individuals_to_address_skewness_and_stabilize_variance>
   Reasoning: Since employed individuals might experience different financial burdens, apply a logarithmic transformation to the DebtToIncomeRatio to reduce skewness and enhance model performance for this group.

3. <EthnicityCreditScoreCombination><cross><Ethnicity><CreditScore><Interaction_between_ethnicity_and_credit_score_as_an_indicator_of_creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Creditworthiness can be significantly influenced by both ethnicity and credit score. This interaction could help capture nuanced insights into how these factors combine to affect credit card application outcomes, especially considering historical and systemic biases.

   - Reasoning: The CreditScore feature shows high variance and skewness. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help in normalizing this data, potentially improving predictive power for the model.

2. <CitizenshipEncode><label_encode><Citizen><Conversion_of_citizenship_status_to_numerical_representation_for_analysis>
   - Reasoning: Converting the categorical Citizenship feature into a numerical format using label encoding will enable the model to better understand and leverage the distinctions in citizenship status.

3. <EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Combined_effect_of_employment_status_and_employment_duration_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Instead of cross-product interaction attempts, directly multiplying Employed and YearsEmployed provides a sense of work stability and duration of employment, potentially important for determining creditworthiness. This is intuitive as both continued employment and its duration can be indicative of stability.

   - Reasoning: The interaction between having a prior default and credit score can provide insights into whether individuals with a history of default are affected differently based on their credit score.

2. <MaritalCitizenshipInteraction><cross><Married><Citizen><Interaction_between_marital_status_and_citizenship_status_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Combining marital status and citizenship status might reveal societal or financial norms affecting credit applications. For example, certain citizenship statuses combined with being married might indicate increased financial stability, influencing credit card application success.

3. <EmployedDebtRatioImpact><multiply><Employed><DebtToIncomeRatio><Impact_of_employment_status_on_financial_burden_and_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Employment status can moderate how financial burdens impact creditworthiness. By multiplying employment status with debt-to-income ratio, the result could indicate how being employed affects one's ability to handle debt, which might impact credit card application success.

   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture how different citizenship statuses interact with credit scores to influence credit card approval. A high credit score might mitigate risks associated with less stable citizenship statuses like Temporary, while amplifying the reliability of those with ByBirth status.

2. <DebtIncomeStabilityRatio><plus><YearsEmployed><DebtToIncomeRatio><Impact_of_employment_duration_and_financial_burden_combined_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Combining YearsEmployed with DebtToIncomeRatio can provide an insightful perspective on how employment stability counteracts financial burdens, affecting an individual’s capability to successfully apply for a credit card.

3. <EthnicityWithDriverLicense><cross><Ethnicity><DriversLicense><Effect_of_ethnicity_and_having_a_drivers_license_on_mobility_and_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Ethnicity combined with having a driver's license can highlight access to resources and mobility, which are significant factors in assessing credit card application success. This interaction might reveal disparities in infrastructure and opportunities among ethnic groups, affecting their financial behavior.

   Reasoning: The current DebtToIncomeRatio has a wide range and high variance that may impact the model's performance. Applying a log transformation could help reduce outliers' effects and improve feature stability.

2. <YearsEmployedBankCustomerInteraction><cross><YearsEmployed><BankCustomer><Combined_effect_of_employment_duration_and_bank_account_ownership_on_credit_card_application_success>  
   Reasoning: People who have been employed for a longer period and have a bank account may have better financial management capabilities, which can positively influence credit card application success.

3. <PriorDefaultSigmoidTransform><sigmoid><PriorDefault><Sigmoid_transformation_of_prior_default_status_to_smooth_out_extreme_values_and_increase_feature_stability_in_model>  
   Reasoning: Using a sigmoid transformation on the PriorDefault feature may help mitigate extreme values' impact and provide a more gradual representation of how prior defaults affect credit card application success.

2026-01-30 15:58:33,540 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features that may improve downstream model performance:

1. <StableCreditScore><subtract><CreditScore><YearsEmployed><Effect_of_employment_duration_subtracting_credit_score_to_assess_stability>  
   Reasoning: The idea is to assess the stability of credit score by considering employment duration. Subtracting years employed from credit score might help capture the essence of financial maturity and stability, which could be a significant predictor of credit card application success.

2. <MaritalEmploymentStatus><cross><Married><Employed><Combined_effect_of_marital_and_employment_status_on_credit_card_application_success>  
   Reasoning: Combining marital and employment status could reveal joint effects of social and economic stability, enhancing prediction of credit card application success. These factors often jointly contribute to financial behavior and profiling.

3. <DebtToIncomeAdjustedZScore><zscore><DebtToIncomeRatio><Adjusted_standardized_debt_to_income_ratio_as_a_normalized_financial_burden_measure>  
   Reasoning: Applying z-score transformation to the DebtToIncomeRatio after exploring its skewed nature can help control outlier effects and improve model robustness, addressing the financial burden as a normalized measure in predictive modeling.

   - Reasoning: Converting the categorical citizenship feature into a numerical format could help the model capture relationships more effectively, potentially benefitting from interactions with other numerical features.

2. <StableEmploymentYearsSchool><multiply><EmployedWithDriverLicense><YearsEmployed><Effect_of_employment_with_driver_license_and_years_employed_on_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: Combining the 'EmployedWithDriverLicense' indicator with 'YearsEmployed' emphasizes long-term stability, reflecting both work history and enhanced mobility, which are critical factors in creditworthiness.

3. <PriorDefaultMarriedInteraction><cross><PriorDefault><Married><Impact_of_prior_default_status_and_marital_status_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between prior default status and marital status may reflect differing levels of financial responsibility or stability. Exploring this interaction could expose useful patterns for prediction.

2026-01-30 15:58:45,028 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three suggestions for feature engineering to potentially improve the downstream model's performance. Each suggestion leverages different aspects of the dataset with thoughtful reasoning.

1. YearsEmployedLogTransform
   - Operator: log
   - Feature1: YearsEmployed
   - Description: Logarithmic_transformation_of_years_employed_to_reduce_skewness_and_stabilize_variance_for_credit_card_application_success
   - Reasoning: The feature YearsEmployed has a high variance and potential skewness. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help stabilize variance and reduce skewness, leading to a more normalized distribution that may improve model performance.

2. CreditScoreCitizenshipInteraction
   - Operator: cross
   - Feature1: CreditScore
   - Feature2: Citizen
   - Description: Impact_of_credit_score_across_different_citizenship_status_on_credit_card_application_success
   - Reasoning: The interaction between CreditScore and Citizen can reveal distinctions in credit card application success based on both creditworthiness and citizenship status, potentially providing predictive insights not captured by analyzing these features individually.

3. IncomeStabilityIndicator
   - Operator: multiply
   - Feature1: Employed
   - Feature2: YearsEmployed
   - Description: Combined_effect_of_employment_status_and_employment_history_on_credit_card_success
   - Reasoning: Multiplying Employed by YearsEmployed provides a compound effect indicator of income stability, combining current employment status and employment history, which may influence the likelihood of credit card application success.

These suggestions aim to utilize transformations, interactions, and compound indicators that have predictive potential based on the existing feature set's characteristics.

2026-01-30 15:58:50,154 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating new features through feature engineering can help improve the predictive capability of the model. In this task, we need to generate additional features based on the given dataset features and descriptions, following certain operational constraints. Here are three potential next steps for feature generation:

1. CitizenEmploymentEffect: Leverage the interaction between citizenship status and employment status because one's immigration status could influence employment stability, and together, these factors can significantly affect credit card application success. 

   
   <CitizenEmploymentEffect><cross><Citizen><Employed><Combined_effect_of_citizenship_status_and_employment_status_on_credit_card_application_success>
   

2. DebtIncomeEthnicityCross: Analyze the impact of financial burden in context with ethnicity. It is essential to understand how different ethnic groups deal with debt, which could affect creditworthiness and the likelihood of credit card application success.

   
   <DebtIncomeEthnicityCross><cross><DebtToIncomeRatio><Ethnicity><Effect_of_combining_financial_burden_with_ethnicity_on_credit_card_application_success>
   

3. StableEmploymentScore: Consider the relevance of work stability (proxy by years employed) and its interaction with credit score. This expression could highlight individuals' financial reliability and potential for credit card approval.

   
   <StableEmploymentScore><multiply><YearsEmployed><CreditScore><Combined_effect_of_employment_duration_with_credit_score_as_an_indicator_of_creditworthiness>
   

The reasoning behind these steps includes capturing the interaction between socio-economic factors, identifying racial/ethnic disparities in financial management, and integrating work stability to assess financial credibility. These engineered features aim to enhance the model's ability to recognize patterns linked to credit card application success more effectively.

   Reasoning: This feature examines the relationship between employment status and citizenship. Different citizenship statuses might have varying access to employment opportunities, which can impact credit card application success.

2. \<DebtToIncomeRatioSigmoidTransform\><sigmoid><DebtToIncomeRatio>\<Sigmoid_transformation_of_debt_to_income_ratio_to_reduce_effect_of_outliers_and_enhance_feature_stability\>

   Reasoning: Applying a sigmoid transformation to the debt-to-income ratio can help smoothen extreme values and stabilize this feature, potentially leading to better model performance by reducing skewness and variance.

3. \<YearsEmployedBankCustomerInteraction\><cross><YearsEmployed><BankCustomer>\<Combined_effect_of_work_duration_and_ownership_of_a_bank_account_on_credit_card_application_success\>

   Reasoning: This feature interaction considers the impact of employment duration in conjunction with having a bank account. An individual with longer employment duration and a bank account might be perceived as having better financial stability, potentially influencing credit card application outcomes.

   Reasoning: Prior defaults and credit score are crucial indicators of financial reliability. Their interaction might reveal deeper insights into the credit history impacting credit card application success.

2. <CitizenDebtToIncomeRatioLogTransform><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Logarithmic_transformation_of_debt_to_income_ratio_for_stabilizing_variance_across_citizenship_types>  
   Reasoning: The Debt-to-Income Ratio has extreme values; a log transformation can reduce skewness and stabilize variance. Examining differences in this transformed metric across citizenship types might help understand how financial burden affects different groups.

3. <EmploymentStabilityIndicator><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Combined_effect_of_employment_status_and_employment_duration_on_financial_stability_and_credit_card_success>  
   Reasoning: Employment duration combined with current employment status can indicate stability, affecting creditworthiness. This metric aims to capture individuals with stable jobs who might be more successful in credit card applications.

2026-01-30 15:59:04,087 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps for generating new features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <EmployedWithBankAccount><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Indicator_if_person_is_employed_and_has_a_bank_account_which_may_signal_financial_stability_and_increase_credit_card_application_success>
   - Explanation: Combining employment status with bank account ownership could signal improved financial stability. People who are employed and have bank accounts might exhibit better financial management skills, which could positively impact their likelihood of getting a credit card.

2. <DebtToIncomeRatioLogTransform><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Logarithmic_transformation_of_debt_to_income_ratio_to_handle_outliers_and_normalize_data_distribution_for_credit_card_application_success>
   - Explanation: The debt-to-income ratio has a wide range and can be skewed due to a few extreme values. Applying a logarithmic transformation can mitigate these outliers and help stabilize variance, potentially leading to more meaningful predictions.

3. <CitizenEmploymentCross><cross><Citizen><Employed><Combined_effect_of_citizenship_status_and_employment_status_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Explanation: Crossing citizenship status with employment status can reveal nuanced insights into how different citizenship types interact with employment opportunities. Some types of citizenship may have more restrictive employment possibilities, affecting credit card application success.
