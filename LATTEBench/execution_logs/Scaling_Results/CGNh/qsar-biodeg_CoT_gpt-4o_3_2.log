   - Reasoning: Squaring the 'SpMax_L' could capture nonlinear effects and enhance the model's ability to distinguish between chemicals that are biodegradable and those that are not, particularly if higher values of SpMax_L disproportionately impact biodegradability.

2. <SpMax_A_times_SpPosA_Bp><multiply><SpMax_A><SpPosA_B(p)><interaction between adjacency matrix leading eigenvalue and spectral positive sum providing insights on structural impact on biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between 'SpMax_A' and 'SpPosA_B(p)' might reveal how structural attributes of chemicals contribute to biodegradability, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between these attributes.

3. <F02CN_reciprocal><reciprocal><F02[C-N]><reciprocal of frequency of C-N at topological distance 2 to downscale influence of low frequency C-N bonds>

2026-01-31 11:30:43,427 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features using the provided operations, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance in classifying biodegradable chemicals:

1. \<SpMax_L_times_LogSpMax_L\>\<multiply\>\<SpMax_L\>\<LogSpMax_L\>\<interaction of leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix and its log-transformed version to capture complex relationships in molecular structure affecting biodegradability\>

   Reasoning: This feature combines the original SpMax_L with its log-transformed version, potentially capturing both linear and logarithmic influences of this critical descriptor on biodegradability.

2. \<nO_squared\>\<square\>\<nO\>\<square of the number of oxygen atoms to emphasize the potential impact of oxygen atom presence on oxidation and biodegradability\>

   Reasoning: Squaring the number of oxygen atoms (nO) could highlight the non-linear impact of oxygen presence, as it may play a critical role in chemical reactions related to biodegradability.

3. \<SdO_divide_HyWi_Bm\>\<divide\>\<SdO\>\<HyWi_B(m)\>\<ratio of sum of dO E-states to Hyper-Wiener-like index to explore the combined effects of dO E-states and mass-weighted molecular connectivity on biodegradability\>

   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio can help to understand the interaction between the sum of dO E-states and the mass-weighted molecular connectivity, which could have implications on the potential for molecular breakdown and biodegradability.

2026-01-31 11:30:55,305 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to further enhance the downstream model's performance in classifying chemicals based on their biodegradability:

1. Create a squared term to capture nonlinear effects of sulfur atom presence:

   The presence of sulfur atoms can significantly affect the chemical's properties and biodegradability due to its potential to form disulfide bonds and affect oxidation states. By squaring the 'SdssC' (Sum of dssC E-states), we emphasize these variations.

   
   <SdssC_squared><square><SdssC><square_of_sum_of_dssC_E-states_to_capture_nonlinear_influence_of_sulfur>
   

2. Interaction between leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix and normalized spectral positive sum to uncover complex structural relationships:

   The interaction between 'SpMax_A' (Leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix) and 'SpPosA_B(p)' (Normalized spectral positive sum from Burden matrix weighted by polarizability) may provide more intricate insights into molecular topology, connectivity, and its weight on polarizability, which can affect the likelihood of biodegradation. 

   
   <SpMax_A_times_SpPosA_Bp><multiply><SpMax_A><SpPosA_B(p)><interaction_between_adjacency_matrix_leading_eigenvalue_and_spectral_positive_sum>
   

3. Capture the complex influence of oxygen atoms' topology on oxidation levels through trigonometric transformation:

   Oxygen atoms significantly contribute to the oxidation level and biodegradability. Using a cosine transformation of the ratio of oxygen atoms to the sum of E-states ('nOvsSumEStates') could unpack hidden periodic relationships between oxygen atom count, their topological placement, and their influence on E-states.

   
   <nOvsSumEStates_cosine><cosine><nOvsSumEStates><cosine_transformation_of_ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_sum_of_E-states>
   

These steps aim to uncover hidden, complex relationships within the data that standard linear or basic models might miss, thereby improving the model's ability to differentiate between ready and not-ready biodegradable chemicals.

2026-01-31 11:31:11,920 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! The aim is to generate new features that might improve biodegradability predictions based on the provided molecular descriptors. Here are three possible steps:

1. <Psi_i_A_reciprocal><reciprocal><Psi_i_A><reciprocal_of_intrinsic_state_pseudoconnectivity_index_to_emphasize_low_pseudoconnectivity_impact_on_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: The reciprocal operator is applied to the intrinsic connectivity index, Psi_i_A, as it can emphasize molecules with low connectivity by giving them higher importance, potentially influencing biodegradability.

2. <nCp_times_F02CN><multiply><nCp><F02[C-N]><interaction_between_terminal_primary_C_sp3_and_C-N_at_topological_distance_2_to_capture_structural_impacts_on_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying the count of terminal primary C(sp3) atoms (nCp) by the frequency of C-N bonds at topological distance 2 (F02[C-N]) could highlight the impact of primary carbon atoms and mid-range bonding on the overall molecular structure affecting biodegradability.

3. <SpMax_Bm_minus_Me><subtract><SpMax_B(m)><Me><difference_between_burden_matrix_eigenvalue_and_mean_atomic_sanderson_electronegativity_to_explore_mass_and_electronegativity_influence_on_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: By subtracting the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me) from the Burden matrix leading eigenvalue weighted by mass (SpMax_B(m)), we can explore the relative balance between mass distribution and electronegativity, which might influence the biodegradability readiness of the chemical compounds.

2026-01-31 11:31:18,242 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here's a potential next step for generating new features:

1. \<SpMax_L_log_squared\><square><LogSpMax_L><square_of_log_transformed_SpMax_L_to_emphasize_non-linear_relationships_capture_complexities_in_structure>
   - Reasoning: The first feature involves taking the square of the log-transformed Leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (LogSpMax_L). Squaring the log-transformed feature can highlight non-linear relationships between this core molecular descriptor and the compound's biodegradability. This transformed feature can capture complexities in molecular structure effectively.

2. \<Psi_i_A_normalized\><zscore><Psi_i_A><normalized_intrinsic_state_pseudoconnectivity_index_to_focus_on_key_variability_in_structure_impacting_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: For the second feature, the z-score normalization of the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index type S average (Psi_i_A) allows the identification of the relative position of each chemical's connectivity within the dataset. This standardization can help explore how variability in connectivity impacts the molecule's readiness for biodegradation.

3. \<nO_vs_nN_ratio\><ratio><nO><nN><ratio_of_oxygen_to_nitrogen_atoms_to_explore_impact_of_oxygen_nitrogen_balance_on_oxidation_capacity_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: The third feature is aimed at capturing the balance between oxygen and nitrogen atoms within the molecule by creating a ratio of nO to nN. This ratio is expected to provide insights into the oxidation potential of the molecule, which can impact biodegradability by delving into the interaction between these key atom counts in the compound.

2026-01-31 11:31:29,092 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, let's generate some feature engineering ideas to potentially enhance the classification of the compounds into ready and not ready biodegradable based on the given molecular descriptors. We will attempt to formulate new features that might better capture the underlying patterns or characteristics of the molecules.

### Possible Next Steps for Feature Generation:

1. Interaction of Oxygen Atoms and Mean Electronegativity  
   This feature captures the potential impact that the balance between oxygen atoms and electronegativity can have on biodegradability, potentially reflecting on oxidative processes.

2. Nonlinear Emphasis on Heavy Atoms and Nitrogen Atoms  
   Here we attempt to capture the influence of both molecular weight and the presence of nitrogen by emphasizing their product through a nonlinear transformation, which might reveal complex interactions regarding stability or reactivity.

3. Normalized Pseudoconnectivity Index Adjusted by Topological Frequency of C-N  
   By normalizing the intrinsic connectivity index and adjusting it for the frequency of C-N at topological distances, this feature aims to capture key connectivity trends affecting biodegradability involving C-N interactions.

These engineered features aim to enhance the ability of the predictive model to discern between biodegradable and non-biodegradable compounds by focusing on nonlinear interactions and normalization techniques to reduce skewness and highlight significant chemical patterns.

2026-01-31 11:31:34,983 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions and generate more insightful features, we need to leverage the existing attributes to capture deeper relationships and patterns. Here are three proposed feature engineering steps, including descriptions and reasoning:

1. Square Log of Mean Atomic Sanderson Electronegativity
   - <Me_log_squared><square><LogSpMax_L><square_of_log_transformed_mean_atomic_Sanderson_electronegativity_to_emphasize_complex_relationships_related_to_electronegativity_impacts_on_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Log transformation is often used to address skewness and normalize a distribution. Squaring this transformation can further accentuate non-linear relationships and highlight the influence of electronegativity on biodegradability.

2. Frequency of C-N at Distance 2 times Leading Eigenvalue from Laplace Matrix
   - <F02CN_times_SpMax_L><multiply><F02[C-N]><SpMax_L><interaction_between_frequency_of_C-N_at_topological_distance_2_and_Laplace_matrix_eigenvalue_to_assess_combined_effect_of_structural_connectivity_and_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Interactions between frequency of specific bond types and eigenvalues can provide insight into how specific structural characteristics influence biodegradability. This feature emphasizes both connectivity and structure through molecular decomposition.

3. Cube of Number of Heavy Atoms
   - <nHM_cubed><cube><nHM><cube_of_heavy_atoms_number_to_amplify_the_influence_of_heavy_atom_presence_on_molecular_weight_and_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Heavy atoms can significantly impact a molecule's mass and its subsequent interactions within an environment, affecting its biodegradability. Cubing this feature can emphasize molecules with high heavy atom counts, which may have outsized influences on the chemical behavior.

These feature engineering steps are aimed at capturing new dimensions and amplifying existing patterns that are likely to serve as decisive factors in understanding the complex relationships affecting chemical biodegradability.

2026-01-31 11:32:14,128 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed steps for generating new features to potentially improve the model's performance in classifying chemicals based on their biodegradability:

1. <nHDon_times_F04CNcubed><multiply><nHDon><F04CNcubed><interaction_between_number_of_donor_atoms_for_H-bonds_and_cubic_transformation_of_frequency_of_C-N_at_topological_distance_4_to_examine_the_combined_effect_of_hydrogen_bond_donors_and_high_frequency_C-N_bonding_on_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the combined effect of hydrogen bond capacity through donor atoms and the cubic transformation of high-frequency C-N bonds, potentially revealing complex bonding patterns influencing biodegradability.

   - Reasoning: By summing the Burden matrix eigenvalue (dependent on mass) and intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity (capturing average connectivity), this feature could reveal the additive structural and connectivity effects on biodegradability readiness.

3. <nO_times_SdssC><multiply><nO><SdssC><interaction_between_number_of_oxygen_atoms_and_sum_of_dssC_E-states_to_capture_combined_effect_of_oxygen_presence_and_sulfur_E-state_distribution>

2026-01-31 11:32:19,614 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions, you can consider generating features that capture complex interactions and transformations relevant to biodegradability. Here are three potential feature engineering steps:

1. Interaction of Pseudoconnectivity and Nitrogen Atom Count
   - Reasoning: Pseudoconnectivity indices can capture the molecular wiring and connectivity patterns that influence biodegradability. Combining this with the count of nitrogen atoms might reveal intricate connections related to nitrogen's role in biodegradation.

2. Non-linear Impact of Heavy Atoms through Sine Transformation
   - Reasoning: Heavy atoms potentially impact the molecular weight and dynamics in a nonlinear manner. Applying sine transformation could emphasize periodic properties or cyclic influences on biodegradability.

3. Interaction between Oxygen Atoms and Sanderson Electronegativity
   - Reasoning: Oxygen atoms often play a significant role in oxidation processes. The interaction with Sanderson electronegativity can uncover the combined influence of oxygen's reactivity and electronegativity on biodegradability.

2026-01-31 11:32:26,163 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps for feature generation that could improve the downstream model's performance, using available operators and features.

1. Interaction between frequency of N-N bonds and intrinsic pseudoconnectivity index
   - Reasoning: The frequency of N-N bonds might have a significant impact on biodegradability, especially when considered with other molecular connectivity features. By interacting this with the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index, we can capture the joint effect of N-N bonding and connectivity on biodegradability.

2. Exponential transformation of the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity
   - Reasoning: The effect of electronegativity on biodegradability could exhibit exponential behavior. Applying an exponential transformation might reveal nonlinear relationships and enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns related to electronegativity impacts.

3. Composite feature of oxygen presence and its influence on electrical properties and connectivity
   - Reasoning: Oxygen is a crucial element, and its presence significantly impacts molecular properties, particularly relating to oxidation. By interacting the number of oxygen atoms with the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity, we get insights into how oxygen’s presence affects electrical and connectivity properties, which may influence biodegradability.

2026-01-31 11:32:41,462 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features aimed at improving prediction of biodegradability:

   Reasoning: A reciprocal transformation on nHDon, in combination with nHM, might moderate the influence of hydrogen bond donors in the presence of heavy atoms, assessing this combined effect on biodegradability.

3. <Psi_i_1d_sigmoid><sigmoid><Psi_i_1d><sigmoid_transformation_of_intrinsic_state_pseudoconnectivity_index_to_catch_subtle_effects_by_smoothing_extreme_values_impacting_biodegradability>
   
   Reasoning: Applying a sigmoid transformation to Psi_i_1d may help in smoothing extreme values, potentially capturing subtle variations in connectivity patterns that influence biodegradability.

   - Reasoning: The presence of donor atoms (such as N and O) is influential in hydrogen bonding, which may affect the tendency for biodegradation. By multiplying nHDon with LogSpMax_L, we aim to capture the synergy between hydrogen bonding capability and structural nuances which might be pivotal for biodegradability.

2. <nN_squared><square><nN><square_of_number_of_nitrogen_atoms_to_intensify_the_effect_of_nitrogen_presence_on_molecular_bonding_and_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Nitrogen atoms can significantly impact the biochemical interactions and reactivity of a molecule. Squaring nN will amplify the influence of nitrogen, providing insights into how variations in nitrogen content can affect biodegradability patterns.

   - Reasoning: The ratio of Psi_i_A (connectivity index) to SpMax_B(m) (mass-weighted eigenvalue) seeks to evaluate the interplay between molecular connectivity and mass distribution. This relation is crucial as it might reveal how molecular structure in terms of connectivity and mass influences the capability to biodegrade.

   *Reasoning:* This feature aims to leverage the combined effect of bonding patterns as expressed by the pseudoconnectivity index and the presence of C-N bonds, potentially revealing insights into how molecular structure impacts biodegradability.

2. <F04[C-N]_times_nO><multiply><F04[C-N]><nO><interaction_between_frequency_of_C-N_at_topological_distance_4_and_number_of_oxygen_atoms_to_assess_combined_effect_of_high_frequency_bonding_and_oxidative_properties_on_biodegradability>

   *Reasoning:* The combined effect of frequent C-N bonds and the presence of oxygen atoms might reveal complex bonding and oxidative interactions that impact the biodegradability. With oxygen often associated with oxidation, its presence alongside frequent bonds could be a key indicator.

3. <Psi_i_A_ratio_SpMax_Bm><ratio><Psi_i_A><SpMax_B(m)><ratio_of_intrinsic_state_pseudoconnectivity_index_to_leading_eigenvalue_from_Burden_matrix_weighted_by_mass_to_explore_balance_between_connectivity_and_mass_distribution_as_a_factor_influencing_biodegradability>

   *Reasoning:* By exploring the ratio between connectivity index and mass-associated eigenvalue from the Burden matrix, this feature could capture the balance or imbalance between structural connectivity and mass density, both of which are crucial for understanding biodegradability influences.

2026-01-31 11:33:37,041 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features aimed at improving the downstream model's performance:

1. Combining Structural Complexity and Electronegative Influence:
   - <SpMax_L_exp_times_Me><multiply><exp><SpMax_L><Me><interaction_of_exponentiated_leading_eigenvalue_from_Laplace_matrix_with_mean_atomic_Sanderson_electronegativity_to_explore_combined_effect_on_electronic_and_structural_features_influencing_biodegradability>
   
   Reasoning: By exponentiating the leading eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix, we can emphasize higher-order structural features. When combined with the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity, this feature can potentially capture interactions between structural complexity and electronic influence that are pertinent to biodegradability.

2. Exploring Bonding Patterns and Pseudoconnectivity:
   - <F04CNcubed_times_Psi_i_1d><multiply><F04CNcubed><Psi_i_1d><interaction_of_cubic_transformed_frequency_of_C-N_bonds_at_topological_distance_4_with_intrinsic_state_pseudoconnectivity_index_to_examine_combined_effect_of_high_frequency_bonding_and_connectivity_patterns_on_biodegradability>
   
   Reasoning: This feature captures the potential impact of high-frequency C-N bonding patterns in conjunction with intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity. Such an interaction could unveil complex bonding and connectivity influences on chemical biodegradability.

3. Assessing Balance Between Heavy Atoms and Topological Features:
   - <nHM_times_SpMax_Bm><multiply><nHM><SpMax_B(m)><interaction_of_number_of_heavy_atoms_with_leading_eigenvalue_from_Burden_matrix_to_explore_combined_influence_of_molecular_weight_distribution_and_mass-weighted_topological_features_on_biodegradability>
   
   Reasoning: Heavy atoms contribute significantly to molecular weight and potentially impact the biodegradability due to their influence on structural topology. By interacting the count of heavy atoms with the leading eigenvalue from the Burden matrix, the feature can highlight the role of mass-weighted topological features in biodegradability predictions.

2026-01-31 11:33:49,345 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential next steps for generating new features, with explanations on the reasoning behind each:

1. Feature Interaction Using Non-Linear Transformation:
   - <Psi_i_1d_exp_times_nHM><multiply><exp><Psi_i_1d><nHM><interaction of exponential transformation of intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity with number of heavy atoms to capture complex relationship affecting molecular structure contributing to biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: By applying an exponential transformation to Psi_i_1d, we can highlight non-linear relationships and interactions with nHM (number of heavy atoms). The combination can help in capturing complex structural influences and connectivity patterns impacting biodegradability.

2. Combining Electronegative and Structural Properties:
   - <nN_squared_times_Me><multiply><square><nN><Me><interaction of squared number of nitrogen atoms with mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity to amplify their combined effect on molecular characteristics influencing biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Nitrogen atoms often play a critical role in molecular bonding and can significantly affect a compound's biodegradability. By combining the squared count of nitrogen atoms with Sanderson electronegativity, we can capture how these atomic properties work together to influence biodegradability.

3. Capturing Influence of Connectivity and Oxygen Presence:
   - <Psi_i_A_times_nO><multiply><Psi_i_A><nO><interaction of intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index with number of oxygen atoms to emphasize combined connectivity pattern and oxidative potential influences on biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Oxygen typically enhances a molecule's oxidation potential, impacting biodegradability. This feature captures the interaction between connectivity patterns (Psi_i_A) and oxidative potential (nO), aiming to provide deeper insights into how these factors influence biodegradability.

These steps aim to explore non-linear interactions between relevant molecular descriptors and leverage transformations that can reveal underlying patterns contributing to predictive performance in biodegradability classification tasks.

1. Interaction between oxidation potential and carbon atom presence  
   - This feature examines the combined impact of oxidation (represented by the number of oxygen atoms, nO) and primary carbon atom presence (nCp). Given that oxidation and carbon-based molecular structures can heavily influence biodegradability, capturing their interaction may provide insights into the chemical's readiness for breakdown.

2. Cubic transformation on intrinsic connectivity index  
   - Cubic transformations can capture non-linear relationships within the data. Applying this to the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index type Psi_i_A could reveal complex connectivity roles in influencing molecular structure and thereby biodegradability.

3. Ratio between sulfur E-state sum and aromatic nitro groups  
   - This feature assesses the relationship between the sulfur E-state sum (SdssC) and the number of nitro groups in aromatic structures (nArNO2). Aromatic nitro groups can be resistant to degradation, while sulfur presence might influence electron distribution. Offering a balance or ratio between these attributes can help understand the broader biodegradability dynamics.

2026-01-31 11:34:00,680 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that may improve the model's performance, we can focus on interactions and transformations that handle skewness, emphasize significant chemical properties, and capture complex relationships. Here are three possible steps:

1. <Psi_i_A_times_SpMax_Bm><multiply><Psi_i_A><SpMax_B(m)><interaction_of_intrinsic_state_pseudoconnectivity_index_with_Burden_matrix_eigenvalue_to_assess_combined_connectivity_and_mass_weighted_topological_influence_on_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Combining the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index with the Burden matrix eigenvalue weighted by mass can reveal the joint effect of molecular connectivity and mass distribution on biodegradability.

2. <F04[C-N]_log_squared><square><log><F04[C-N]><square_of_log_transformed_frequency_of_C-N_at_topological_distance_4_to_emphasize_non-linear_relationships_in_high_frequency_binding_and_capture_complex_structural_impact_on_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Transforming and then squaring the log of F04[C-N] helps deal with skewness while emphasizing high-frequency bonding patterns that could influence biodegradation resistance.

3. <nHDon_times_Me><multiply><nHDon><Me><interaction_between_number_of_donor_atoms_for_H-bonds_and_mean_atomic_Sanderson_electronegativity_to_explore_combined_effect_on_hydrogen_bonding_efficiency_and_electronegativity_related_to_biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Analyzing the synergy between hydrogen bond donors and mean atomic electronegativity highlights the potential combined effect of molecular polarity and electronegativity on biodegradability.
