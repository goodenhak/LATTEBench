2026-01-31 10:42:40,442 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating features and their explanations:

### Step 1: Interaction between Income and Age
Reasoning: Older people with higher income might have better financial stability, making them more likely to successfully apply for a credit card. By combining Income and Age, we capture this interaction.

<income_age_ratio><divide><Income><Age><Ratio_of_income_to_age>


### Step 2: Stability through Employment and YearsEmployed
Reasoning: Stability in employment is a key factor for credit approval. Multiplying YearsEmployed and whether someone is Employed can help create a feature indicative of employment stability.

<employment_stability><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Indicator_of_employment_stability>


### Step 3: Interaction between PriorDefault and CreditScore
Reasoning: Having a prior default might hurt credit scores. Combining PriorDefault and CreditScore can help quantify the combined effect of these factors on credit card application success.

<default_credit_interaction><multiply><PriorDefault><CreditScore><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_credit_score>

2026-01-31 10:42:50,182 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features with reasoning:

### Step 1: Capture potential interactions between marital status and citizenship
Reasoning: Marital status and citizenship together might influence credit approval, as they could reflect personal stability or eligibility for certain credit policies.

<marital_citizen_interaction><cross><Married><Citizen><Combined_information_of_marital_status_and_citizenship_to_identify_patterns_in_credit_approval>


---

### Step 2: Introduce income-employment interaction stability using rolling mean
Reasoning: Stability and changes in financial behaviors like income and employment can impact credit card approval likelihood.

<rolling_income_employment_stability><rolling_mean><income_employment_interaction><Indicator_of_stability_in_income_and_employment_over_time>


---

### Step 3: Combine prior default history with weighted credit score
Reasoning: A history of prior defaults combined with weighted credit scores could give insight into risk levels, which are critical for credit card approval.

2026-01-31 10:42:57,477 - INFO - LLM Output: ### Step 1: Generate features by exploring interactions and transformations
1. <income_marital_citizen_interaction><cross><income_employment_interaction><marital_citizen_interaction><Combined_interaction_of_income_employment_status_with_marital_and_citizen_information_to_identify_credit_patterns>
   - *Reasoning*: Combining income_employment_interaction with marital_citizen_interaction could reflect combined socioeconomic and stability patterns in predicting credit card success, given the importance of income and marital/citizenship status in financial decisions.

2. <rolling_debt_stability_mean><rolling_mean><rolling_income_employment_stability><Indicator_of_financial_stability_over_time_capturing_income_and_outstanding_debt_trends>
   - *Reasoning*: rolling_income_employment_stability captures stability over time. Applying a rolling mean could smooth trends and reflect long-term financial stability, helping to understand risk profiles of individuals better.

3. <adjusted_credit_debt_ratio><ratio><adjusted_credit_score><Debt><Ratio_of_adjusted_credit_score_to_outstanding_debt_to_reflect_financial_risk_management>
   - *Reasoning*: A ratio between adjusted_credit_score and Debt reflects an individual’s ability to manage debt with their creditworthiness. This could be an important indicator for predicting credit approval.

### Step 2: Explanation and opportunities
These features aim to capture meaningful interactions or ratios between existing predictors that reflect credit and financial characteristics. Cross and ratio operators reveal deeper relationships, while rolling mean captures temporal trends. Each step aligns with the goal of improving model performance by offering nuanced predictors.

2026-01-31 10:43:02,937 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that may improve the predictive performance of the downstream model:

1. <employment_income_stability_score><multiply><rolling_income_employment_stability><YearsEmployed><Combined_indicator_of_stability_in_income_and_employment_over_years>  
   Reasoning: Combining stability in income and employment (rolling_income_employment_stability) with the number of years employed provides a meaningful feature that captures the longevity and consistency of an individual’s financial situation. This feature can help differentiate individuals with stable income sources and longer employment duration, which might correlate with creditworthiness.

2. <prior_default_debt_ratio><ratio><Debt><PriorDefault><Ratio_of_outstanding_debt_to_prior_default_status_to_assess_credit_risk>  
   Reasoning: This feature computes the ratio of an individual’s scaled outstanding debt (Debt) to their prior default status (PriorDefault). Individuals with high outstanding debt and a prior default history may be at a greater risk, impacting their likelihood to successfully apply for a credit card.

3. <marital_citizen_encoded><label_encode><marital_citizen_interaction><Encoded_representation_of_marital_status_and_citizenship_combination>  
   Reasoning: Converting the combined information of marital status and citizenship (marital_citizen_interaction) into a numerical format allows models to handle this categorical data more effectively. Encoding this information preserves its utility, enabling the learning of patterns that might relate to credit approval likelihood.

2026-01-31 10:43:08,273 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible new features to generate using the provided operators and features, along with an explanation of their potential to improve downstream model performance:

---

1. <income_marital_status_ratio><ratio><income_employment_interaction><Married><Ratio_of_interaction_between_income_and_employment_status_to_marital_status>
   - Reasoning: Married individuals may have different financial behavior compared to singles. Combining income and employment interaction with marital status could better capture the effect of marital status on credit card application success.

2. <prior_default_income_stability_cross><cross><PriorDefault><rolling_income_employment_stability><Interaction_of_prior_default_status_with_income_and_employment_stability>
   - Reasoning: An applicant's prior default status coupled with their income and employment stability could provide stronger signals about their financial risk and thus creditworthiness.

3. <income_employment_default_adjusted_credit_interaction><multiply><income_employment_interaction><default_adjusted_credit_interaction><Interaction_of_income_and_employment_status_with_adjusted_credit_risk_profile>
   - Reasoning: The interplay between income/employment patterns and the adjusted credit interaction (which already considers prior defaults) could create a robust feature to represent financial stability and credit risk.

---

These steps aim to strengthen the model's ability to detect patterns of financial stability or risk, which are crucial determinants for determining credit card application success.

2026-01-31 10:43:14,247 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the specified operations, aimed at improving downstream model performance:

---

1. <citizen_debt_interaction><cross><Citizen><Debt><Combined_information_of_citizenship_and_outstanding_debt_to_assess_credit_risk_profile>  
   Reasoning: Citizenship can reveal residency patterns, while debt provides insight into financial liabilities. Crossing these features could highlight unique credit risk profiles associated with different citizenship types and outstanding debt levels. This combined feature may improve the prediction of credit card approval.

2. <income_employment_stability_zscore><zscore><rolling_income_employment_stability><Standardized_indicator_of_stability_in_income_and_employment_over_time>  
   Reasoning: The rolling stability indicator has a very high variability (Std = 1714.7588). Applying Z-score normalization could remove the effect of scale differences and bring focus to patterns in stability among different applicants. Standardized features often improve model prediction accuracy.

3. <debt_prior_default_interaction><multiply><Debt><PriorDefault><Interaction_of_outstanding_debt_with_prior_default_risk_to_model_credit_behavior>  
   Reasoning: Debt levels combined with prior defaults can indicate repayment risk. Multiplying these two features creates a risk-sensitive profile, which likely improves the model's ability to predict creditworthiness and approval probabilities.

   - Reasoning: People with longer employment duration and a driver's license may have more stable profiles, indicating responsibility, potentially leading to higher credit card approval rates. This feature captures the interplay between employment and accessibility (driver's license) status.

2. <debt_income_ratio><divide><Debt><income_employment_interaction><Ratio_of_outstanding_debt_to_interaction_of_income_and_employment_status_to_assess_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: By creating a ratio between debt and the interaction of income/employment, one can gauge financial stability. Higher debt relative to income/employment might correlate with lower credit card success due to riskier profiles.

3. <gender_employment_interaction><cross><Gender><YearsEmployed><Combined_information_of_gender_and_employment_duration_to_explore_patterns_in_credit_approval>
   - Reasoning: Gender and employment duration together may provide insights into patterns related to credit approval rates, as societal factors can impact financial decisions and opportunities differently based on these attributes.

2026-01-31 10:43:36,410 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions in a downstream credit card approval model, we need to identify feature interactions or transformations that provide deeper insights into a person's financial stability, risk profile, and socio-economic behavior. The goal is to unveil patterns that weren't transparent initially and enhance the discriminative power of the model.

Here are three potential next steps for feature engineering:

1. <employment_debt_interaction><multiply><YearsEmployed><Debt><Interaction_of_years_employed_with_outstanding_debt_to_assess_long_term_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: Combining years employed and outstanding debt helps capture a person's ability to manage debt over time based on their employment stability. This interaction can highlight whether long-term employment contributes to better managing debt, providing insight into credit card success.

2. <marital_status_citizen_encoding><label_encode><marital_citizen_interaction><Numerical_encoding_of_combined_marital_status_and_citizenship_information>
   - Reasoning: Converting the categorical feature combining marital status and citizenship into a numerical encoding might improve model performance through better pattern recognition in socio-economic behaviors influencing credit card approvals.

3. <income_debt_ratio><divide><income_employment_interaction><Debt><Ratio_of_interaction_between_income_and_employment_to_outstanding_debt_to_assess_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: Measuring the proportion of income and employment interaction relative to debt helps evaluate financial stability. A lower ratio might indicate high debt relative to income, suggesting possible financial strain and thus affecting credit card approval odds.

These steps aim to deepen the insights into applicant profiles by enhancing the relationship between employment, socio-economic status, and financial metrics.

   Reasoning: By multiplying the income_employment_interaction with the adjusted_credit_score, we can create a feature that captures the synergy between income/employment stability and creditworthiness, potentially enhancing the prediction of credit approval success by combining financial reliability with credit scoring.

2. <marital_citizen_numeric><label_encode><marital_citizen_interaction><Numerical_representation_of_combination_between_marital_status_and_citizenship>

   Reasoning: Encoding marital_citizen_interaction can provide a numerical representation of complex categorical combinations, allowing the model to interpret them in relation to other numerical features and possibly uncover hidden patterns that affect credit card approval.

3. <debt_income_stability_score><groupbythenmean><Married><subtract><Debt><rolling_income_employment_stability><Mean_adjusted_difference_between_outstanding_debt_and_income_employment_stability_based_on_marital_status>

   Reasoning: Calculating the mean-adjusted difference between Debt and rolling_income_employment_stability for different marital statuses could highlight how marriage affects financial stability and risk, particularly when assessing creditworthiness where debt plays a significant role against stable income.

2026-01-31 10:43:44,779 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <debt_income_interaction><multiply><Debt><income_employment_interaction><Interaction_between_outstanding_debt_and_income_employment_status_to_assess_financial_stability>  
   Reasoning: Since both Debt and Income (interacting with employment) are crucial in assessing financial stability, this interaction can reveal patterns in how current financial obligations and income relate to success in credit card applications.

2. <default_employment_interaction><multiply><PriorDefault><YearsEmployed><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_years_employed_to_indicate_credit_behavior>  
   Reasoning: Combining prior defaults with employment duration can provide insight into a person's reliability or stability post-default, potentially highlighting trends in credit approval. Those with longer employment may have improved circumstances despite defaults.

3. <citizen_zipcode_interaction><cross><Citizen><ZipCode><Combined_information_of_citizenship_and_geographical_location_to_identify_creditworthiness_patterns>  
   Reasoning: Geographic location might affect credit approval due to regional economic conditions, housing markets, or demographics. Combining this with citizenship status could provide insights into location-based patterns and the impact of citizenship on credit approval in different areas.

2026-01-31 10:43:49,091 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features that might improve the model's performance:

1. <debt_to_income_employment_stability_ratio><ratio><Debt><rolling_income_employment_stability><Ratio_of_outstanding_debt_to_stability_in_income_and_employment_exploring_financial_stability>
   - Reasoning: This step aims to capture the relationship between an individual's outstanding debt and their stability in employment and income, which could be indicative of their financial robustness and ability to repay credit, potentially affecting their success in credit card applications.
  
2. <citizen_zipcode_concat><concat><Citizen><ZipCode><Combined_geographical_and_citizenship_information_to_explore_location_based_credit_patterns>
   - Reasoning: Combining citizenship status with geographical location may uncover patterns in credit card approval based on the region and citizen classification, providing a more detailed picture of potential success in applications.

3. <prior_default_marital_status_cross><cross><PriorDefault><Married><Combined_risk_assessment_from_prior_default_status_and_marital_status_to_explore_credit_behavior>
   - Reasoning: By crossing prior default status with marital status, this feature evaluates the combined influence of past defaults and marital stability, offering insight into credit behavior, which could help predict credit card application success.

   *Reasoning:* Combining PriorDefault with income_employment_interaction could provide insights into how individuals with past defaults manage their income and employment, potentially highlighting risk profiles related to credit card approval.

2. <zipcode_stability_ratio_divide><ZipCode><rolling_income_employment_stability><Ratio_of_zipcode_to_stability_in_income_and_employment_to_explore_geographical_financial_behavior>  
   *Reasoning:* The ratio of geographical information (ZipCode) to stability in income and employment could show regional patterns in financial behavior, possibly indicating areas with better or worse credit approval rates.

3. <marital_employment_encoded_label_encode><marital_citizen_interaction><Numerical_representation_of_combined_marital_status_and_employment_information_to_explore_credit_patterns>  
   *Reasoning:* Encoding marital_citizen_interaction as a numerical feature might facilitate easier calculations and connections between marital status, citizenship, and employment behavior, which could be indicative of credit approval likelihood. Using label encoding could enhance model performance by effectively integrating categorical data into numerical analysis.

2026-01-31 10:44:02,399 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's explore some feature engineering possibilities that could enhance the predictive power of the downstream model. Each step harnesses the existing dataset features and the permissible operations to potentially improve model performance.

### Feature Engineering Steps:

1. Assessing Risk with Employment Duration and Defaults:
   - Reasoning: Understanding how the risk profile changes with employment duration and prior defaults could provide insights into credit behavior, specifically for individuals with prior defaults who are employed for longer periods.
   - Feature:
     - <employment_default_risk_score><multiply><YearsEmployed><PriorDefault><Quantifying_risk_assessment_based_on_employment_duration_and_prior_default_status>

2. Deriving Stability from Citizenship and Income Patterns:
   - Reasoning: Combining citizenship status with income patterns may reveal location-based financial stability trends, particularly if income and employment interactions are influenced by location and citizenship status.
   - Feature:
     - <citizenship_income_stability><cross><Citizen><income_employment_interaction><Exploring_stability_in_income_and_employment_patterns_based_on_citizenship_status>

3. Utilizing ZIP Code for Geographical Risk Analysis:
   - Reasoning: Incorporating geographical data (ZipCode) with debt allows the analysis of regional debt concentrations and can identify potentially risky regions for credit issuance.
   - Feature:
     - <regional_debt_concentration><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Debt><Capturing_geographical_debt_patterns_by_averaging_outstanding_debt_per_zip_code>

These feature engineering steps aim to enhance the predictive capability of the downstream credit card approval model by capturing interactions and relationships that are likely to impact the credit approval decision.

2026-01-31 10:44:12,804 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions in the credit card application success model, focusing on interactions and ratios can help refine feature importance, especially concerning relationships between financial stability, risk, and demographic data. Here are three feature engineering steps:

1. <priordefault_risk_score><multiply><PriorDefault><adjusted_credit_score><Quantified_risk_profile_based_on_prior_default_status_and_weighted_credit_score>
   - Reasoning: By multiplying 'PriorDefault' with 'adjusted_credit_score', this feature aims to quantify the credit risk profile based on historical defaults and credit score adjusted by employment duration. This can help assess how likely someone's prior default might impact their current creditworthiness.

2. <marital_drivers_interaction><cross><marital_citizen_interaction><DriversLicense><Combined_information_of_marital_status_citizenship_and_drivers_license_to_explore_behavioral_patterns>
   - Reasoning: Crossing 'marital_citizen_interaction' with 'DriversLicense' may uncover patterns related to credit approval associated with life stability, legal residence, and mobility opportunities, which are often indicators of financial behavior and trustworthiness.

3. <income_stability_ratio><divide><income_employment_interaction><rolling_income_employment_stability><Ratio_of_income_and_employment_status_interaction_to_stability_in_income_and_employment>
   - Reasoning: Dividing 'income_employment_interaction' by 'rolling_income_employment_stability' provides a ratio indicating the relationship between current income and employment inputs versus the historical stability in these areas. This can help gauge consistency in an applicant's financial situation over time, possibly affecting credit card approval.

These engineered features leverage interactions and ratios to highlight individual credit risk profiles, uncover behavioral patterns, and capture financial stability dynamics, potentially aiding in predicting credit card application outcomes more accurately.

2026-01-31 10:44:18,682 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's propose three possible feature engineering steps to improve the predictive performance of the downstream credit card application success model. Here are the proposed steps, including reasoning for each:

### Feature 1

Reasoning: Combining the effects of having a driver's license can provide additional insights into behavioral patterns associated with credit success. By interacting it with employment duration, we can examine if those with a license are more stable in their employment, which may correlate with credit success.

1. <employment_driver_interaction><cross><YearsEmployed><DriversLicense><Interaction_of_employment_duration_with_drivers_license_status_to_identify_behaviors_relating_to_credit_card_success>

### Feature 2

Reasoning: Examine the geographic impact of citizenship status on credit behavior. By interacting the user’s citizenship status with their ZipCode, we might uncover location-based patterns in credit card application success. Identifying such features may reflect different acceptance policies based on the resident status within certain regions.

2. <citizen_zipcode_interaction><cross><Citizen><ZipCode><Combined_information_of_citizenship_and_geographical_location_to_identify_creditworthiness_patterns>

### Feature 3

Reasoning: Understanding the risk profile through transformed prior defaults can provide crucial insights. Applying a logarithmic transformation could help in managing the skew of the data. The interaction with adjusted credit score will allow us to assess the credit risk profile more robustly.

3. <log_default_credit_interaction><log><default_adjusted_credit_interaction><Logarithmic_transformation_of_interaction_between_prior_default_and_adjusted_credit_score_for_better_skew_management>

These features aim to encapsulate additional behavioral and socio-economic insights, potentially offering the model more granular information to work with, thereby improving prediction accuracy for credit card application decisions.

1. <prior_income_stability_interaction><cross><PriorDefault><rolling_income_employment_stability><Interaction_of_prior_default_status_with_income_and_employment_stability_to_assess_credit_risk_profile>

   - Reasoning: Individuals with prior defaults but stable income and employment records might have better repayment abilities, making them less risky despite their default history. This interaction could highlight those who have improved their financial stability post-default, potentially influencing credit approval.

2. <marital_gender_stability_interaction><cross><Married><Gender><rolling_income_employment_stability><Combined_effect_of_marital_status_and_gender_on_income_employment_stability_to_assess_credit_behavior>

   - Reasoning: Marital status combined with gender might reveal unique income and employment stability patterns. For example, couples might have more stable incomes due to shared financial responsibilities. This interaction could provide insights into creditworthiness based on demographic factors.

3. <adjusted_credit_driver_interaction><cross><adjusted_credit_score><DriversLicense><Combined_interaction_of_adjusted_credit_score_with_drivers_license_possession_to_explore_risk_profile>

   - Reasoning: Individuals with higher weighted credit scores who also possess a driver's license might have established trust and responsibility, indicating potential for successful credit approval. This interaction could help capture nuances in behavior and risk patterns that consider both financial metrics and lifestyle choices. 

By strategically combining existing features, these engineered features aim to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful credit card applicants, potentially improving predictive accuracy.

2026-01-31 10:44:29,347 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential new feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <employment_financial_balance><ratio><YearsEmployed><debt_to_income_employment_stability_ratio><Ratio_of_employment_duration_to_financial_stability_metric_aiming_to_assess_long_term_risk_management>
   - Reasoning: This feature generates a ratio between the years employed and the debt to income employment stability ratio. This can provide insights into how stable employment might offset or correlate with financial stability factors, potentially highlighting creditworthiness over a longer term.

2. <gender_marital_citizen_cross><cross><Gender><marital_citizen_interaction><Combined_interaction_of_gender_with_marital_and_citizenship_information_to_identify_behavioral_and_credit_approval_patterns>
   - Reasoning: This interaction aims to capture how the combination of gender with marital status and citizenship can display unique patterns in credit applications. Such cultural and social factors might contribute to different credit-seeking behaviors and approval efficiencies, providing nuanced insights into credit risk modeling.

3. <credit_stability_zscore><zscore><default_adjusted_credit_interaction><Standardized_measure_of_risk_interaction_focusing_on_prior_default_and_adjusted_credit_score_highlighting_skew_management>
   - Reasoning: Applying a z-score transformation on the default_adjusted_credit_interaction can normalize its distribution, allowing the model to better distinguish between different levels of risk. Standardization can be particularly useful if the variable has a skewed distribution, thereby improving feature interpretability and model performance.

   - Reasoning: The adjusted credit score weighted by years employed is a significant indicator of creditworthiness. By multiplying it with years employed, we can create a feature that enhances the signal for individuals who have maintained employment over time while managing their credit score.

2. <default_citizen_credit_interaction><cross><PriorDefault><Citizen><Exploration_of_risk_profile_based_on_prior_default_status_and_citizenship_information>
   - Reasoning: Citizenship status could have distinctive impacts on credit behavior, potentially due to differing credit systems for people born in different locations. Combining this with prior default status helps to explore patterns associated with geographic and citizenship impacts on credit risk.

3. <debt_marital_income_stability_ratio><ratio><Debt><rolling_income_employment_stability><Ratio_of_outstanding_debt_to_stability_in_income_and_employment_to_reflect_financial_stress_level>
   - Reasoning: By dividing debt by the rolling income and employment stability indicator, we can measure the degree of financial stress relative to their income stability over time. Those with high debt but low stability might exhibit higher risks. This feature follows a similar logic to debt_to_income_employment_stability_ratio, but more focused on marital patterns.

2026-01-31 10:44:38,274 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance for predicting credit card approval:

1. <prior_default_marital_income_interaction_x2><cross><prior_default_marital_status_cross><income_employment_interaction><Enhanced_combined_interaction_of_prior_default_and_marital_status_with_income_employment_to_identify_credit_risk>
   Reasoning: By further exploring the interaction between prior default status, marital status, and income/employment, this feature can provide a more nuanced view of risk assessment related to credit behavior.

2. <income_debt_to_stability_zscore><zscore><debt_to_income_employment_stability_ratio><Standardized_metric_of_financial_stability_exploring_debt_to_income_and_employment_ratio>
   Reasoning: Standardizing the ratio of debt to income/employment stability can help in minimizing skewness and outlier effects, which may enhance the predictive power of the model.

3. <gender_citizen_marital_cross><cross><Gender><marital_citizen_interaction><Enhanced_combination_of_gender_with_citizenship_and_marital_status_to_reflect_behavioral_and_risk_patterns>
   Reasoning: Understanding the intersection of gender, citizenship, and marital status can reveal important patterns related to credit card approval, leveraging demographic factors that may influence financial and credit behavior.

   Reasoning: Combining citizenship with income and employment interaction could reveal patterns specific to geographical stability and financial behavior, which can be crucial for predicting credit card approval success.

2. <education_marital_status_cross><cross><EducationLevel><Married><Combined_information_of_education_level_and_marital_status_to_identify_social_patterns_related_to_credit_approval>

   Reasoning: Education level, when combined with marital status, may provide insights into social and financial responsibility patterns that affect creditworthiness.

3. <employment_income_stability_zscore><zscore><rolling_income_employment_stability><Standardized_indicator_of_long_term_income_stability_reflecting_financial_and_employment_patterns>

   Reasoning: Standardizing the rolling income and employment stability feature would normalize the impact of large outliers and enhance the stability assessment's contribution to the credit approval prediction, especially in cases with extreme values.

   Reasoning: By interacting the stability in income and employment with prior default status, we can explore how the stability, alongside past defaults, influences credit card approval success. This may help capture nuanced financial stability that affects creditworthiness.

2. \<employment_citizen_effect\><cross>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Citizen\>\<Exploring_the_effect_of_years_employed_based_on_citizenship_status_to_identify_patterns_in_credit_card_approval_success\>

   Reasoning: Interacting citizenship with years employed helps identify if individuals with distinct citizenship statuses show different employment durations that correlate with credit card approval success. This can be a useful feature for identifying patterns based on employment and citizenship demographics.

3. \<debt_employment_driver_interaction\><multiply>\<Debt\>\<DriversLicense\>\<Exploring_the_combined_effect_of_outstanding_debt_and_driver's_license_status_to_assess_credit_success\>

   Reasoning: By multiplying debt with driver's license possession status, we assess how possessing a driver's license (potentially indicating mobility and social status) interacts with financial obligations, potentially influencing credit application success. This captures a social-behavioral aspect which could be relevant for credit card approval patterns.

Reasoning:

1. Income Stability Debt Interaction: This feature attempts to capture the combined influence of income and employment interaction with debt ratio, providing a multifaceted view of financial stability and risk. The interaction could indicate whether individuals with stable income and employment, along with certain debt ratios, are likely successful in credit applications.

2. Risk Adjusted Credit Score: By creating a ratio of the weighted credit score with categorical variables like marital and citizenship information, we explore how personal characteristics potentially modulate risk and success in credit applications. This feature examines whether marital and citizenship factors interact with credit scores in predicting credit approval.

3. Financial Stability Indicator: Grouping by geographical and citizenship information and calculating the standard deviation of income stability, this feature aims to identify areas or demographic groups where financial stability is more volatile, suggesting potential risks or opportunities in credit behavior patterns. This examination may uncover geographical credit patterns that are crucial in predicting credit card application success.

   Reasoning: By using a rolling mean on the rolling_income_employment_stability feature, we can assess the stability of the applicant's income over time for high-income individuals. This feature aims to capture long-term trends and provide a reliable measure of financial stability for credit card approval.

2. <driver_debt_risk_level><multiply><DriversLicense><Debt><Quantified_interaction_of_debt_and_drivers_license_status_to_assess_risk_level_for_credit_card_applications>

   Reasoning: The hypothesis here is that driver's license status could interact with outstanding debt to exert influence over risk assessments for credit card applications. The feature driver_debt_risk_level would capture both aspects to help segregate applicants with lower risk profiles based on specific interactions between having a driver's license and level of debt.

3. <stability_risk_interaction><cross><stability_income_default_interaction><default_adjusted_credit_interaction><Combined_effect_of_income_stability_and_adjusted_credit_score_interaction_to_indicate_risk_behavior>

   Reasoning: This feature combines stability_income_default_interaction and default_adjusted_credit_interaction to analyze the combined effects of income stability with prior default interactions and adjusted credit scores. By using a cross operator, it may help discern patterns or trends that single features cannot, enhancing model effectiveness in predicting credit card application success.

   *Reasoning:* This feature examines how stable someone's income and employment have been given their duration of employment. People with higher stability over longer employment might be more likely to be successful in credit card applications.

2. <credit_stability_score><multiply><adjusted_credit_score><debt_to_income_employment_stability_ratio><Combined_credit_and_financial_stability_score_to_assess_risk_behavior>

   *Reasoning:* By combining the credit score with the debt-to-income/employment stability ratio, this feature aims to capture individuals who manage their debts well and have stable financial conditions, potentially indicating better credit risk profiles.

3. <gender_marital_status_driver_concat><concat><Gender><marital_citizen_interaction><DriversLicense><Combined_categorical_feature_of_gender_marital_citizenship_and_drivers_license_status_to_explore_behavioral_patterns_in_credit_approval>

   *Reasoning:* Using concat on gender, marital status, and drivers license status creates a holistic view of behavioral patterns that could affect credit approval. This unique feature might capture complex social and economic interactions impacting credit success.

These steps focus on exploring stability in employment and income, assessing risk through comprehensive credit and debt ratios, and leveraging demographic and social factors for nuanced credit behavior predictions.

   Reasoning: The interaction between prior default and adjusted credit score is crucial in capturing risk behavior. Cross it with income stability which reflects a person's financial steadiness over time. This could help in understanding how past defaults, credit score, and income stability jointly affect credit card application success.

2. <employment_income_stability_zscore><zscore><rolling_income_employment_stability><Standardized_indicator_of_income_and_employment_stability_over_time>

   Reasoning: Standardizing the income and employment stability will allow you to assess the consistency of income and employment across individuals in a way that mitigates the influence of skewness and outliers. A z-score transformation can help better understand relative stability which is essential for predicting credit card approval.

3. <gender_citizen_marital_cross><cross><Gender><marital_citizen_interaction><Enhanced_combination_of_gender_with_citizenship_and_marital_status_to_reflect_behavioral_and_risk_patterns>

   Reasoning: Combining gender with marital and citizenship information could provide insights into behavioral patterns and risk associated with obtaining credit cards. Gender can influence credit decision-making differently based on marital status and citizenship type and can capture nuanced behavioral trends.

2026-01-31 10:45:12,694 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<income_debt_employment_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<income_employment_interaction\>\<Debt\>\<Interaction_between_income_and_employment_status_with_outstanding_debt_to_assess_financial_stability\>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between income, employment status, and outstanding debt could provide insights into an individual's financial stability or stress level. This combination might capture those with high income but disproportionate debt, potentially affecting credit success.

2. \<gender_marital_default_cross\>\<cross\>\<Gender\>\<prior_default_marital_status_cross\>\<Combined_effect_of_gender_with_prior_default_and_marital_status_to_explore_behavioral_patterns\>
   - Reasoning: Combining gender information with prior default and marital status data could uncover behavioral patterns or societal biases influencing credit card approval odds. This feature might help uncover underrepresented correlations.

3. \<rolling_employment_zscore\>\<zscore\>\<rolling_income_employment_stability\>\<Standardized_indicator_of_stability_in_income_and_employment_over_time_for_financial_stability_analysis\>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing the stability of income and employment over time (via z-score) allows for the comparison of individuals’ stability against the dataset’s overall patterns. This could highlight individuals who differ exceptionally in economic steadiness and predict creditworthiness better.

These newly engineered features leverage existing interactions, introduce behavioral dimensions, and employ standardization to optimize the prediction performance for credit success, covering different aspects of financial behavior and stability.

2026-01-31 10:45:17,463 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we can focus on deriving interaction features or normalizing existing features based on insights or relationships in the data. Here are three potential steps for feature engineering:

1. <prior_default_gender_interaction><cross><PriorDefault><Gender><Combined_interaction_of_prior_default_status_with_gender_to_explore_behavioral_credit_patterns>

   *Reasoning*: Gender can influence financial decision-making and risk behavior. By exploring the interaction between prior default status and gender, we may capture key behavioral patterns regarding credit applications that aren't captured by these features individually.
  
2. <normalized_income_employment_interaction_zscore><zscore><income_employment_interaction><Standardized_income_and_employment_interaction_metric_to_improve_risk_assessment>

   *Reasoning*: Z-score normalization of the income and employment interaction helps in adjusting its scale and making its contribution more consistent, especially if there are significant variances in this feature. This could improve the model's effectiveness in assessing financial stability across different individuals.
  
3. <debt_marital_citizen_interaction><cross><Debt><marital_citizen_interaction><Assessment_of_risk_based_on_combined_information_of_outstanding_debt_and_marital_citizenship_status>

   *Reasoning*: Interaction between debt, marital status, and citizenship could reveal credit risk patterns uniquely associated with demographics combined with financial obligations, providing deeper insights into patterns of creditworthiness.

2026-01-31 10:45:22,603 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly, here are three potential steps for generating new features using the operations provided. These steps aim to capture additional interactions and relationships that could improve the downstream task of predicting credit card application success.

### Step 1:
Feature: <prior_default_gender_marital_citizen_cross><cross><prior_default_marital_status_cross><Gender><marital_citizen_interaction><Combined_interaction_of_prior_default_marital_status_gender_and_citizenship_to_explore_credit_behavioral_patterns>

Reasoning: This feature combines prior defaults, marital status, gender, and citizenship information. The combination of these categorical attributes could provide insights into the behavioral patterns of different segments regarding credit applications.

### Step 2:
Feature: <credit_stability_score_log><log><default_adjusted_credit_interaction><Logarithmic_transformation_of_interaction_between_prior_default_and_adjusted_credit_score_to_better_handle_skewness_in_risk_assessment>

Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to the interaction between prior default status and adjusted credit score is beneficial for dealing with skewness and amplifying subtle variations. This transformation may help in identifying high-risk profiles that are not apparent through linear modeling.

### Step 3:
Feature:  <debt_income_marital_stability_cross><cross><debt_to_income_employment_stability_ratio><marital_citizen_interaction><Combined_assessment_of_debt_income_stability_with_marital_and_citizenship_information_to_examine_financial_risk>

Reasoning: By crossing the debt-to-income employment stability ratio with the marital and citizenship interactions, we aim to capture complex interactions that might reveal unique financial risk profiles, particularly where marital status and citizenship influence debt repayment behavior and credit card success.

2026-01-31 10:45:28,698 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features that might improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <prior_default_gender_driver_interaction><cross><PriorDefault><Gender><DriversLicense><Combined_interaction_of_prior_default_status_with_gender_and_driver's_license_status_to_explore_behavioral_patterns_and_risk_level>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the effects of prior default status, gender, and driver's license possession to identify potential patterns in credit behavior. Considering gender and the legal ability to drive (as indicated by having a driver's license) might provide insight into risk assessment or behavioral tendencies in credit card applications.

2. <income_stability_risk_score><multiply><income_employment_interaction><stability_income_default_interaction><Exploring_financial_and_stability_interaction_in_assessing_credit_risk_profile>
   - Reasoning: Combining income and employment interaction with stability and prior default interaction may highlight the impact of financial stability and default risk, essential for assessing creditworthiness. This interaction could capture nuanced behavior and risk levels potentially overlooked with standalone features.

3. <marital_default_citizen_zip_interaction><cross><prior_default_marital_status_cross><citizen_zipcode_concat><Combined_interaction_of_marital_status_and_prior_default_with_geographical_and_citizenship_information_to_explore_creditworthy_patterns>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture complex interactions between marital and credit history default status (as represented by prior default and marital status crossing) with geographical and citizenship factors, reflecting potential location-based patterns and behavioral intricacies in credit card success.

   Reasoning: Citizenship status and outstanding debt can reveal geographical and socio-economic factors influencing creditworthiness. The combined feature might capture location-based credit risk patterns linked to debt levels.

2. <prior_default_income_drivers_interaction><cross><PriorDefault><income_employment_interaction><Combined_effect_of_prior_default_status_with_income_and_employment_interaction_to_address_financial_risk_and_vehicle_ownership>

   Reasoning: Integrating prior default history with income and employment status can provide a deeper understanding of the applicant's financial stability, especially when combined with driver's license ownership, as having a license can reflect socio-economic status.

3. <marital_drivers_income_interaction><cross><Married><DriversLicense><income_employment_interaction><Exploration_of_marital_status_and_vehicle_ownership's_influence_on_income_and_employment_stability>

   Reasoning: Marital status might influence financial stability, and when combined with driver's license status and income/employment interaction, it could provide insights into socio-economic stability, thereby affecting credit card application success rates.

   - Reasoning: By exploring the combined interactions of PriorDefault, Gender, and Citizenship, we aim to capture behavioral patterns that may affect credit approval chances based on historical defaults, gender differences, and citizenship status. This may uncover nuanced trends in credit risk associated with different demographics and default histories.

2. \<debt_income_stability_indicator\><ratio>\<Debt\>\<rolling_income_employment_stability\><Assessing_the_indicator_of_financial_stability_by_relating_outstanding_debt_to_income_and_employment_stability>
   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio between Debt and the rolling_income_employment_stability can provide insights into the financial stability of individuals. A lower ratio may indicate better stability and management of debt relative to income and employment, possibly improving credit approval predictions by reflecting financial robustness.

3. \<employment_default_marital_citizen_interaction\><cross>\<YearsEmployed\>\<prior_default_marital_status_cross\><Analyzing_the_combined_effect_of_employment_duration_with_prior_default_and_marital_status_on_credit_success_patterns>
   - Reasoning: By examining the interaction between YearsEmployed, PriorDefault, and marital status, we can capture whether employment duration mitigates the risks associated with prior defaults and marital status in accessing credit. This multifaceted interaction can be vital in understanding how diverse factors interplay to influence credit application success.

   - Reasoning: This feature combines the risk assessment from prior default and marital status with the interaction of income and employment status, aiming to capture a more complicated picture of credit behavior that might indicate risk aversion.

2. <adjusted_credit_stability_ratio><ratio><adjusted_credit_score><rolling_income_employment_stability><Ratio_of_weighted_credit_score_to_income_and_employment_stability_exploring_financial_resilience>
   - Reasoning: This feature assesses the relationship between credit score weighted by employment duration and the stability of income and employment over time. A better financial position can be indicated by having a high credit score and stable income, which might suggest a stable and consistent ability to repay credit.

3. <citizen_influenced_zipcode_interaction><concat><Citizen><ZipCode><Enhancing_geographical_citizenship_information_to_explore_credit_patterns_by_region>
   - Reasoning: This feature concatenates citizenship status with zip code information to explore potential geographical influences on creditworthiness patterns. It can reveal how location combined with citizenship affects credit approval likelihood, identifying if certain regions with specific citizenship demographics are more creditworthy.

2026-01-31 10:45:50,049 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided dataset and features, the next steps aim to enhance the predictive power of the model by capturing interactions, stability measures, and risk assessments more efficiently. Here are three proposed feature engineering steps:

1. <employment_debt_stability_ratio><ratio><YearsEmployed><debt_employment_driver_interaction><Ratio_of_employment_duration_to_combined_debt_and_driver_license_interaction_to_assess_long_term_stability_and_credit_risk>   
   *Reasoning*: This feature aims to highlight the relationship between employment duration and the financial stability indicated by the interaction of outstanding debt and driver’s license possession. Longer employment durations generally indicate stability, and this stability may mitigate the risks posed by debt levels combined with driver’s license status.

2. <income_credit_risk_interaction><multiply><income_employment_interaction><default_adjusted_credit_interaction><Exploring_combined_effect_of_income_employment_and_prior_default_adjusted_credit_interaction_on_risk_profile>    
   *Reasoning*: The interaction between income and employment activity with the prior default-adjusted credit interaction could provide insights into risk profiles. This feature allows for quantifying the economic behavior and credit risk through the context of a prior default, as it directly affects predictive capacity regarding credit card approval success.

3. <citizen_marital_employment_stability_interaction><cross><citizen_zipcode_concat><marital_citizen_interaction><Combined_effect_of_geographical_citizenship_information_with_marital_status_identifying_stability_patterns_in_employment_and_credit_approval>   
   *Reasoning*: Combining geographical citizenship data and marital status through interaction can reveal patterns or insights on stability and credit behavior across different demographics. These interactions often align with cultural or regional credit behaviors that could affect approval predictions.

These steps introduce interactions between stability indicators, risk profiles, and demographic aspects, potentially refining the model’s understanding of successful credit card applications.

2026-01-31 10:45:55,314 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps for feature generation using the provided operators to enhance the downstream model's performance. Each feature aims to capture different aspects of the data, either by combining existing features in a novel way or by transforming them to extract additional insights.

1. \<prior_default_citizen_interaction\><cross>\<PriorDefault\>\<Citizen\>\<Interaction_of_prior_default_status_with_citizenship_to_explore_behavioral_credit_risk_patterns\>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the prior default status with citizenship information. It captures potential differences in credit behaviors and risk patterns based on whether someone has previously defaulted and their citizenship status.

2. \<income_debt_ratio\><divide>\<income_employment_interaction\>\<Debt\>\<Ratio_of_income_employment_interaction_to_outstanding_debt_to_explore_financial_stability_and_credit_behavior\>
   - Reasoning: This feature measures the ratio of income and employment interaction to outstanding debt. A higher ratio might indicate better financial stability, potentially leading to a higher likelihood of successful credit approval.

3. \<adjusted_credit_gender_interaction\><cross>\<adjusted_credit_score\>\<Gender\>\<Combined_effect_of_adjusted_credit_score_and_gender_on_credit_success_patterns\>
   - Reasoning: By crossing adjusted credit scores with gender, this feature explores whether there are gender-related patterns in how adjusted credit scores influence credit success, providing insights into any discrepancies or biases.
