2026-01-30 15:36:58,598 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the operators, with the aim of enhancing the downstream model's performance:

1. <duration_installment_ratio><divide><duration><installment_commitment><Ratio of duration to installment commitment>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between the duration of the credit and the installment commitment. A higher ratio could imply more extended credit duration compared to the installment size, which might be a relevant indicator of creditworthiness or risk.

2. <age_bin><bin><age><Binned age groups>
   - Reasoning: Binning the age feature into categories could help capture non-linear relationships between age and credit decisions. For instance, different age groups might have inherently different credit risks or behaviors. Discretizing numeric features like age can sometimes uncover patterns not visible in the continuous data.

3. <property_credit_history_cross><cross><property_magnitude><credit_history><Cross-feature combining property magnitude and credit history>
   - Reasoning: Creating a cross-feature between property_magnitude and credit_history can capture interactions between the type of property owned or declared and their past credit behavior. Certain combinations (e.g., owning real estate with a good credit history) might significantly influence credit approval odds.

   *Rationale*: This feature captures the interaction between the amount of credit and its purpose, which might help differentiate applicants based on how much they intend to borrow for various purposes, potentially reflecting their repayment capability or risk.

2. \<savings_credit_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<savings_status\>\<credit_amount\>\<Ratio of savings to the credit amount\>  
   *Rationale*: This feature can assess the relative financial stability of a person by comparing their savings with the amount of credit they seek, providing insights into their ability to manage additional debt.

3. \<credit_duration_residence_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<credit_duration_ratio\>\<residence_since\>\<Interaction between credit duration ratio and years of residence\>

1. Feature: Credit Utilization Ratio
   - Reasoning: Creating a feature that relates the credit amount to the user's income or savings could help identify the borrower's utilization level, which is often indicative of creditworthiness.
   - <credit_utilization_ratio><divide><credit_amount><savings_status><Ratio of credit amount to savings status>

2. Feature: Historical Credit Behavior
   - Reasoning: Creating a feature that reflects past credit behavior by combining credit history and the number of existing credits might help capture patterns related to risk and creditworthiness.
   - <historical_credit_behavior><cross><credit_history><existing_credits><Cross-feature combining credit history with the number of existing credits>

3. Feature: Income Stability

   Reasoning: This feature captures the total financial commitment involved in the credit. A higher product value might indicate a larger risk or higher likelihood of default, especially if not matched by adequate income or savings.

2. \<credit_history_savings_status_interaction\><cross><credit_history><savings_status><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_savings_status>  
   Reasoning: This feature highlights the relationship between an individual's credit history and their savings status. For instance, someone with a critical credit history but >=1000 in savings might still be a good candidate for credit, indicating resilience in managing finances despite past issues.

3. \<installment_income_ratio\><divide><installment_commitment><income_stability><Ratio_of_installment_commitment_to_income_stability>  
   Reasoning: This feature provides insight into how feasible the installment payments are relative to the individual's income stability. A lower ratio indicates that the person allocates a smaller proportion of their stable income to installment payments, which might imply a higher likelihood of receiving credit.

   - Reasoning: This feature might provide insight into the financial stability and reliability of the individual. A high ratio might indicate shorter employment relative to the loan duration, potentially implicating less stability or recent employment, which could affect creditworthiness.

2. <credit_duration_residence><divide><duration><residence_since><Ratio_of_duration_to_residence_years>  
   - Reasoning: This feature may capture the correlation between an individual's stability of residence against the credit duration. Individuals who have been at their residence longer may be deemed more stable and thus potentially more creditworthy.

3. <existing_credits_dependency_ratio><divide><existing_credits><num_dependents><Ratio_of_existing_credits_to_dependents>  
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the burden of credit on the individual relative to the number of dependents. A higher ratio may indicate more strain on an individual’s finances given the number of dependents, affecting their creditworthiness.

2026-01-30 15:37:29,909 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <employment_credit_duration_savings_cross><cross><employment><duration><savings_status><Cross-feature combining employment status, duration, and savings status>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction among the individual's employment status, the length of the credit, and their savings account status, which can be a strong indicator of financial stability and creditworthiness.

2. <credit_savings_ratio><divide><credit_amount><savings_status><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: Dividing the credit amount by the savings status can provide a measure of how leveraged a person is compared to their savings, potentially highlighting higher risk or more conservative financial behavior.

3. <credit_purpose_savings_cross><cross><purpose><savings_status><Cross-feature_combining_credit_purpose_and_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: Different purposes for credit might relate differently to a person’s savings status, affecting their likelihood of receiving credit. This feature examines if certain purposes imply better or worse savings status, and thus, credit eligibility.

2026-01-30 15:37:36,287 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that may improve the performance of the downstream model:

1. <credit_savings_history_cross><cross><credit_history><savings_status><Cross-feature_combining_credit_history_and_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit history with the savings status can provide insights into the financial behavior of an individual regarding their credit and saving habits. This cross-feature may capture different behaviors, such as individuals with critical credit history and no savings versus individuals with good credit history and substantial savings.

2. <installment_credit_ratio><divide><installment_commitment><credit_amount><Ratio_of_installment_commitment_to_credit_amount>
   - Reasoning: This feature provides an understanding of the installment commitment as a percentage of the credit amount. It helps evaluate the financial burden on individuals relative to the credit they take, shedding light on their ability to repay.

3. <personal_status_employment_cross><cross><personal_status><employment><Cross-feature_combining_personal_status_and_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: Personal status combined with employment status might capture socio-economic status differently. Combining these features may unveil patterns related to creditworthiness, as the combination of relationship status and job stability could influence financial security.

   *Reasoning:* This interaction feature can capture the relationship between the credit amount and stability through residence duration, which might influence credit approval decisions. Longer residence may imply stability, thus potentially impacting creditworthiness when combined with the credit amount.

2. <employment_duration_ratio><divide><employment><duration><Ratio_of_employment_duration_to_credit_duration>  
   *Reasoning:* The ratio of employment duration to the credit duration can provide insights into the applicant's job stability relative to the credit period. A higher ratio may indicate better stability, which could be a predictor of credit approval likelihood.

3. <savings_checking_cross><cross><savings_status><checking_status><Cross-feature_combining_savings_status_and_checking_account_status>  
   *Reasoning:* This cross-feature combines savings and checking account statuses, potentially highlighting financial behaviors that influence credit approval. A combination of healthy savings and checking statuses might suggest better financial management, potentially improving credit approval predictions.

2026-01-30 15:37:46,842 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <checking_savings_cross><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Cross-feature_combining_checking_account_status_and_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: Combining checking and savings account status can provide insight into the overall financial health of the individual. This cross-feature may reveal patterns indicating whether an applicant has adequate financial resources, which can affect credit decisions.

2. <income_age_interaction><multiply><income_stability><age_duration_interaction><Interaction_between_income_stability_and_age_duration>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the stability of the income measured by the income_stability with the age_duration_interaction. It could provide a new dimension to assess the applicant's long-term financial reliability and ability to uphold payment commitments over time.

3. <historical_payment_credit_ratio><divide><credit_amount><age_duration_interaction><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_age_based_duration_interaction>
   - Reasoning: This ratio examines the proportion of the credit amount to the interaction between age and duration. By contextualizing credit size relative to applicant's age and loan duration, this feature could help evaluate the risk linked to larger loans for younger applicants or small loans for older applicants.

2026-01-30 15:37:55,093 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps for feature generation using the provided operations:

1. <employment_duration_interaction><multiply><income_stability><duration><Interaction_between_employment_stability_and_duration>  
   *Reasoning*: Combining employment stability with credit duration might highlight customers with higher employment consistency who might be more reliable in long-term credit commitments. This interaction may also reveal long-term employment patterns that correspond to stable income and better creditworthiness.

2. <savings_income_combined><cross><savings_status><income_age_interaction><Cross-feature_combining_income_stability_and_savings_status>  
   *Reasoning*: Cross-features combining information about savings and the relationship between income stability and age can help capture the financial stability of the applicant. This combination has the potential to improve the predictive power of the model by highlighting applicants with savings aligned with stable income patterns across different age groups.

3. <credit_amount_to_savings><divide><credit_amount><savings_status><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_status>  
   *Reasoning*: Calculating the ratio of the credit amount to the savings status can help quantify the appeal of a potential credit compared to the applicant’s current savings. This feature might be useful for capturing the scale of credit relative to savings, helping to determine riskier profiles. A ratio that offers insight into how much credit an applicant is asking for relative to their savings could be an indicator of potential default risk.

2026-01-30 15:38:02,058 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps for feature engineering:

1. <housing_credit_duration_cross><cross><housing><duration><Cross-feature_combining_housing_and_credit_duration>
   - Reasoning: The type of housing (rent, own, for free) could influence the credit risk associated with the duration of the loan. By creating a cross-feature with duration, we may capture specific patterns related to housing preferences and their impact on the credit's length.

2. <credit_amount_personal_status_interaction><cross><credit_amount><personal_status><Interaction_between_credit_amount_and_personal_status>
   - Reasoning: The credit amount, when combined with personal status (such as marital status or sex), could provide insights into the borrower's profile and their ability to handle different credit amounts. This interaction might reveal specific risks related to personal and financial characteristics.

3. <savings_existing_credit_ratio><divide><savings_status><existing_credits><Ratio_between_savings_status_and_number_of_existing_credits>
   - Reasoning: The relationship between savings status and the number of existing credits can indicate a borrower's financial health and credit behavior. Calculating this ratio can help assess whether individuals with specific savings statuses are more likely to manage multiple credits effectively, providing valuable information for credit risk assessment.

2026-01-30 15:38:09,971 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream task's performance, we'll focus on creating meaningful features that could potentially reveal new patterns or relationships. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the new features we're proposing:

1. Rationale:
   - By exploring interactions between the credit amount and savings status, reliable insights can be obtained regarding the applicant's financial stability. 
   - Higher credit amounts with considerable savings may indicate a lower risk. Therefore, defining the multiplication between credit amount and the numeric transformation of savings status could capture such interactions.

   plaintext
   <credit_savings_numeric_multiply><multiply><credit_amount><savings_status><Cross-feature_combining_numerical_transformation_of_savings_status_and_credit_amount>
   

2. Rationale:
   - Analyzing the relationship between duration and housing could reveal the stability of the person's living situation. Housing ownership and the long duration of credit may suggest financial stability. 
   - Exploring this as a cross-feature may enhance the predictive power further.

   plaintext
   <duration_housing_cross><cross><duration><housing><Cross-feature_combining_credit_duration_and_housing_status>
   

3. Rationale:
   - Investigating how existing credits interact with the credit history reveals patterns in repayment behavior and financial responsibility. 
   - This historical lens may allow for a better prediction of future creditworthiness.

   plaintext
   <existing_credits_credit_history_cross><cross><existing_credits><credit_history><Cross-feature_combining_existing_credits_and_credit_history>
   

These steps attempt to uncover potential correlations and insights that may not be immediately apparent with the raw features alone, thereby potentially improving the model's accuracy in predicting credit eligibility.

1. Feature Interaction - Historical Context:

   The current approach leverages historical credit behavior, but there can be potential improvements by exploring more granular interactions between historical credit behavior and historical payment ratios. This driving idea is to better capture repayment behavior nuances, which can influence credit decisions.

Reasoning:

1. Historical Payment Behavior Interaction: This feature is aimed at capturing more nuanced credit repayment behaviors by combining historical credit behavior and payment credit ratio, providing a better understanding of how historical payment patterns may impact credit decisions. This can be particularly insightful for assessing borrowers' long-term financial discipline.

2. Purpose-Based Credit Evaluation: This feature aims to understand how credit amounts relate to their intended purposes. Certain purposes may correlate with higher default risks or require larger amounts, offering specific insights into different types of credit applications.

3. Demographic and Financial Stability: This interaction seeks to marry demographic markers (personal status) with financial markers (income stability) to assess the likelihood of a positive credit decision. Specifically, it evaluates borrower solvency and risk tolerances.

   - Reasoning: Binning the credit duration feature can help capture non-linear relationships between duration and the likelihood of credit approval. It can also help reduce the noise in the duration feature by creating distinct categories that a predictive model can use.

2. \<credit_amount_checking_interaction\><multiply>\<credit_amount\>\<checking_status\>\<Interaction_between_credit_amount_and_checking_status\>  
   - Reasoning: This interaction could reveal insights into how the credit amount requested interacts with an applicant's checking status. Applicants with higher checking account status limits or specific statuses might behave differently in terms of creditworthiness when requesting higher credit amounts.

3. \<purpose_checking_cross\><cross>\<purpose\>\<checking_status\>\<Cross-feature_combining_credit_purpose_and_checking_status\>  
   - Reasoning: By combining the purpose of the credit with the checking account status, we can capture potential patterns where the use of credit (e.g., buying a new car versus business) interacts differently depending on the applicant's checking status, which could influence the likelihood of credit approval.

2026-01-30 15:38:32,778 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_amount_duration_ratio><multiply><credit_amount><credit_duration_ratio><Product_of_credit_amount_and_duration_ratio>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying the credit amount by the credit duration ratio captures the interaction between how much credit is being asked for and its proportional duration impact. This can emphasize scenarios where higher credit amounts are justified by longer durations, which might correlate with creditworthiness better.

2. <savings_checking_combined_cross><cross><savings_status><checking_status><Cross-feature_combining_savings_status_and_checking_account_status>
   - Reasoning: Crossing savings and checking account statuses can reveal deeper insights into the applicant's financial health. It considers both short-term liquidity and long-term savings, which together, provide a clearer picture of financial stability.

3. <credit_history_income_stability_cross><cross><credit_history><income_stability><Cross-feature_combining_credit_history_and_income_stability_for_risk_assessment>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit history with income stability provides a holistic view of an applicant's financial risk profile. Credit history indicates past behavior while income stability provides the likelihood of consistent income, crucial for repayment capacity assessment.

2026-01-30 15:38:41,139 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, let's propose three potential feature engineering steps to improve the predictive performance of the credit decision model using the given operators:

1. Feature Interaction with Personal and Financial Stability:
   - Reasoning: The interaction between personal status and income stability can provide insights into how personal circumstances affect financial reliability. This feature could capture nuances in financial behavior based on marital status and employment stability.
   - <personal_income_stability_interaction><cross><personal_status><income_stability><Interaction_between_personal_status_and_income_stability_for_credit_risk_assessment>

2. Historical Credit and Payment Ratio Assessment:
   - Reasoning: Creating a feature that involves historical credit behavior and historical payment credit ratio can provide insights into the consistency of credit repayment patterns over time. This is a potent signal for assessing creditworthiness.
   - <historical_credit_payment_ratio><multiply><historical_credit_behavior><historical_payment_credit_ratio><Interaction_between_historical_credit_behavior_and_payment_ratio>

3. Purpose-Specific Credit Amount Interaction:
   - Reasoning: Different credit purposes might indicate different levels of risk or repayment behavior. Combining the credit amount with the purpose using a cross feature might enhance the understanding of borrowing patterns and risk associated with specific credit purposes.
   - <credit_purpose_amount_cross><cross><purpose><credit_amount><Cross-feature_combining_credit_purpose_and_credit_amount_for_behavior_analysis>

These steps aim to uncover deeper relationships between financial behavior and credit risk by creating composite features that capture complex interactions in the data.

2026-01-30 15:38:55,405 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators. The focus is on interactions and transformations that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance by capturing complex patterns in the data. 

1. <duration_credit_history_interaction><cross><duration><credit_history><Cross-feature_combining_credit_duration_and_credit_history_for_behavioral_analysis>
   - This feature aims to capture the interaction between the duration of credit and the applicant's credit history. The intuition is that applicants with longer credit durations may have different risk profiles depending on their past credit history. By cross-combining these features, the model may learn better about applicant reliability over various time frames.

2. <income_stability_impact><multiply><income_stability><credit_history><Interaction_of_income_stability_with_credit_history_to_assess_risk_trends>
   - By creating this feature, we are exploring how the stability of an applicant's income interacts with their credit history. Stable income might mitigate or exacerbate the impact of a negative credit history. This interaction could unveil new insights into credit default risk based on personal financial stability patterns over time.

3. <savings_checking_credit_cross><cross><savings_status><checking_status><credit_amount><Combined_feature_involving_savings_checking_status_and_credit_amount>
   - This feature combines the savings status, checking account status, and credit amount to provide a deeper insight into the financial standing and behavior of the applicant. By linking the savings and checking account statuses with the credit amount, the model could capture more granulated financial profiles which might aid in better understanding applicants' financial exposure. 

These steps focus on interactions and transformations that utilize both direct financial behaviors and derived stability indicators, aiming to form nonlinear and deeper patterns that might better inform the prediction task.

2026-01-30 15:39:03,192 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible new feature engineering steps to create potentially useful features for the downstream model:

1. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Numerical_transformation_of_savings_status_for_enhancing_predictive_power>  
   *Reasoning*: Encoding the categorical savings_status into numerical values can help in capturing the latent order or ranking inherent in the categories, potentially allowing the model to better understand the relationship between savings status and credit risk.

2. <credit_income_stability_cross><cross><credit_amount><income_stability><Cross-feature_combining_credit_amount_and_income_stability_to_assess_credit_risk_dependency_on_income_stability>  
   *Reasoning*: Combining credit_amount with income_stability could provide insights into how the stability of income influences the amount of credit applied for. This could be crucial for differentiating between high and low-risk applicants.

3. <age_personal_status_cross><cross><age_duration_interaction><personal_status><Cross-feature_combining_age_based_duration_interaction_and_personal_status_to_capture_demographic_behaviors_related_to_credibility>  
   *Reasoning*: Cross-referencing age_duration_interaction with personal_status could reveal patterns in credit behavior that are influenced by both the age-related duration interaction and personal demographics, which might be a significant factor in predicting creditworthiness.

2026-01-30 15:39:12,644 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's generate three new potential features using the provided operations. The objective is to help improve the downstream model's performance in predicting credit approval.

### Step 1: Interaction between Personal Status and Credit Duration Ratio

1. New Feature: <personal_credit_duration_interaction><cross><personal_status><credit_duration_ratio><Interaction_between_personal_status_and_credit_duration_ratio>

   Reasoning: This feature attempts to capture the influence of an individual's personal status (such as being single or married) on the credit duration ratio. Understanding how different personal statuses impact the ratio of credit amount to duration could provide insights into creditworthiness and risk propensity.

### Step 2: Historical Credit and Payment Plans Interaction

2. New Feature: <historical_payment_behavior_interaction><cross><historical_credit_behavior><other_payment_plans><Cross-feature_combining_historical_credit_behavior_and_other_payment_plans>

   Reasoning: This feature combines historical credit behavior with the existence of other payment plans like bank, stores, or none. It aims to uncover any patterns in how past credit behavior and involvement with other payment plans affect the likelihood of receiving credit.

### Step 3: Enhanced Assessment of Credit Amount with Housing and Age Interaction

3. New Feature: <credit_housing_age_interaction><multiply><credit_amount><housing><Cross-feature_combining_housing_status_with_credit_amount_to_assess_living_cost_influence_on_credit>

   Reasoning: By interacting the credit amount with housing status (own, rent, for free), this feature aims to provide insight into how living costs correlate with credit needs. Individuals owning a house might pose different risk profiles compared to those renting or living for free, which could affect their credit assessments.

These new features are crafted to better capture the risk factors associated with personal circumstances, financial obligations, and housing situations, thereby potentially enhancing the predictive capabilities of the credit approval model.

2026-01-30 15:39:20,216 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's propose three potential next steps for feature engineering to improve the model's performance. These steps aim to exploit the interactions and transformations among the available features to capture complex dependencies.

### Proposed Feature Engineering Steps:

1. <credit_purpose_historical_interaction><cross><purpose><historical_credit_behavior><Interaction_between_purpose_and_historical_credit_behavior>
   - Reasoning: By examining the relationship between the credit's purpose and the borrower's historical credit behavior, we may capture patterns indicating a likelihood of credit repayment or default. For example, certain purposes might be associated with better or worse historical repayment behaviors.

2. <duration_income_stability_product><multiply><duration><income_stability><Product_of_credit_duration_and_income_stability>
   - Reasoning: Duration combined with income stability can capture the borrower's ability to manage and repay long-term credits. A stable income might counterbalance a longer credit duration, indicating creditworthiness.

3. <credit_history_age_interaction><cross><credit_history><age_duration_interaction><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_age-based_duration>
   - Reasoning: This feature explores how a borrower's credit history interacts with age-based credit behavior, which can be an indicator of experience with credit management over time and aging. Clients with certain credit histories may exhibit different credit behaviors as they age, affecting their risk profiles.

2026-01-30 15:39:26,845 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, it's essential to create features that capture interactions, non-linear relationships, and categorical nuances. Below are three suggested feature engineering steps using the provided operators:

1. Combining credit history with purpose:
   - <credit_purpose_credit_history_cross><cross><credit_history><purpose><Cross-feature_combining_credit_history_with_purpose_to_understand_borrowing_risks_associated_with_different_credit_reasons>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures how the historical credit behavior might influence the decision to borrow for specific reasons like a new car or education. Understanding the correlation between the purpose and the credit background can help in predicting creditworthiness.

2. Non-linear transformation of credit amount:
   - <credit_amount_cubic><cube><credit_amount><Cubic_transformation_of_credit_amount_to_capture_non-linear_relationships>
   - Reasoning: Non-linear transformations can help in modeling non-linear patterns between the credit amount and the decision to approve credit. The cubic transformation amplifies any extreme values, potentially highlighting applicants who might stand out due to exceptionally high credit amounts.

3. Interaction between personal status and income stability:
   - <personal_status_income_stability_interaction><cross><personal_status><income_stability><Cross-feature_combining_personal_status_and_income_stability_to_analyze_financial_dependency_influences>
   - Reasoning: Personal status, such as being married or single, combined with income stability, may impact credit approval. This interaction feature explores how the financial stability may vary across different personal statuses, offering insights into financial dependencies related to credit decisions.

These steps aim to uncover deeper insights and relationships within the data, potentially improving prediction accuracy by providing additional context and detail to the model.

   *Reasoning*: Applying a log transformation to the age-duration interaction feature can help capture non-linear relationships that may influence credit approval. Logarithmic transformations are often used to stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed, which can boost the model's performance.

   - Reasoning: This feature aims to identify patterns or variations in credit durations based on the purpose of the credit. Understanding the typical durations associated with each credit purpose can help refine the prediction model by highlighting potentially risky or unrealistic duration expectations for given purposes.

2. <income_checking_interaction><cross><income_stability><checking_status><Interaction_between_income_stability_and_checking_account_status_for_credit_risk_assessment>
   - Reasoning: This feature evaluates the interaction between income stability and the status of the checking account. It helps capture the financial behavior and risk profile by understanding how checking status could influence credit risk among different income stability categories.

3. <purpose_credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><purpose><Log_transformation_of_credit_amount_for_each_purpose_to_assess_non-linear_relationships_in_credit_usage>
   - Reasoning: Applying a log transformation to the credit amount conditioned on the credit purpose allows the model to capture non-linear relationships between credit amount and purpose, which could enhance predictive power by accounting for extreme values or skewed distributions in credit usage across different purposes.

2026-01-30 15:39:54,320 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operations:

1. <credit_amount_sigmoid><sigmoid><credit_amount><Sigmoid_transformation_of_credit_amount_to_normalize_values_and_capture_non-linear_relationships>
   - Reasoning: Applying a sigmoid transformation to the credit amount helps in normalizing the values between 0 and 1. This can aid in capturing non-linear relationships between credit amount and credit approval decisions, potentially leading to improved model performance.

2. <age_housing_cross><cross><age_duration_interaction><housing><Cross-feature_combining_age-based_duration_interaction_and_housing_status_to_understand_the_influence_of_age_on_housing_preferences_and_credit_approval>
   - Reasoning: Cross-features combining age-related interactions with housing status can provide insights into how different age groups' housing choices impact credit approval outcomes. This can help in uncovering demographic patterns that affect creditworthiness.

3. <duration_credit_history_multiply><multiply><duration><credit_history><Product_of_duration_and_credit_history_to_examine_combined_influences_on_credit_outcome>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying credit duration with credit history may reveal the impact of both the duration of the credit and the individual's credit history on credit approval. This joint effect can be significant in assessing the risk associated with extending credit. 

These new features aim to capture potentially complex interactions and transformations of existing features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

2026-01-30 15:40:01,352 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operations, aimed at improving the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_amount_sigmoid_transformed><sigmoid><credit_amount><Sigmoid_transformation_of_credit_amount_to_normalize_credit_request_amounts>  
   *Reasoning*: Applying a sigmoid transformation to the credit amount can help normalize extreme values and capture non-linear relationships, potentially improving model performance. This transformation can mitigate the effect of outliers on the prediction model by compressing the scale, which can lead to better generalization.

2. <purpose_credit_history_cross><cross><purpose><credit_history><Cross-feature_combining_credit_purpose_and_credit_history_to_assess_risk_associated_with_specific_borrowing_reasons>  
   *Reasoning*: Crossing the purpose of credit with credit history can provide insights into the risk profiles associated with particular borrowing reasons. This feature can help the model identify whether certain purposes, when coupled with credit history, are more susceptible to defaults.

3. <existing_credits_residence_cross><cross><existing_credits><residence_since><Cross-feature_combining_existing_credits_with_residence_duration_to_understand_housing_stability_in_credit_assessment>  
   *Reasoning*: Combining the number of existing credits with the duration of residence could help capture housing stability—a factor often related to financial stability and creditworthiness. This feature aims to improve the model's ability to assess the reliability of long-term residents in meeting their credit obligations.
