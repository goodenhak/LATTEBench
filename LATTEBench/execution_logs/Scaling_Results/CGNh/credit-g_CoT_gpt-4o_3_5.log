2026-01-30 15:48:37,417 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_amount_per_month><divide><credit_amount><duration><Average_credit_amount_per_month>
   Reasoning: Calculating the monthly credit amount can provide insight into the borrower's repayment ability compared to their monthly income, which can be critical for assessing credit risk.

2. <age_deciles><bin><age><Age_bins_for_risk_assessment>
   Reasoning: People of different age groups may exhibit varying credit risks, and binning age into deciles could help in capturing risk trends related to age.

3. <checking_employment_cross><cross><checking_status><employment><Interaction_between_checking_status_and_employment>
   Reasoning: Creating interaction features between checking account status and employment may provide additional insights into a person's financial stability and repayment capability.

1. <credit_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of the credit amount to the credit duration can provide insight into the borrower's repayment capacity, highlighting cases where a high amount is borrowed over a short period.

2. <savings_employment_interaction><cross><savings_status><employment><Interaction_between_savings_status_and_employment>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between savings status and employment can help capture the financial stability and job security of an individual, potentially improving risk assessment.

3. <age_property_magnitude_interaction><cross><age_deciles><property_magnitude><Interaction_between_age_deciles_and_property_magnitude>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines age-related risk factors with the type of property owned, which can reflect the financial maturity and asset ownership level, aiding in understanding creditworthiness.

2026-01-30 15:48:56,753 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps designed to enhance the predictive model's performance:

1. <employment_duration_income_ratio><divide><employment><installment_commitment><Ratio_of_employment_to_installment_commitment>  
   Reasoning: This feature examines the balance between the years of employment and the proportion of income committed to installments. A higher ratio might indicate better job stability relative to financial obligations, potentially leading to a higher likelihood of receiving credit.

2. <property_income_interaction><cross><property_magnitude><installment_commitment><Interaction_between_property_type_and_installment_rate>  
   Reasoning: A cross feature between property type and installment rate could uncover unique patterns in how property ownership impacts creditworthiness, possibly addressing lifestyle or economic stability aspects.

3. <personal_check_cross><cross><personal_status><checking_status><Interaction_between_personal_status_and_checking_account_status>   
   Reasoning: This interaction might reveal nuances in financial behavior and credit risk based on marital status and checking account condition, potentially highlighting stability factors or financial habits.

2026-01-30 15:49:03,597 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <savings_employment_checking_cross><cross><savings_employment_interaction><checking_status><Interaction_between_savings_employment_and_checking_status>
   - Reasoning: Combining savings status, employment status, and checking account status might provide a more comprehensive view of the financial stability and reliability of the applicant. This could improve the model's ability to discern patterns related to credit risk.

2. <age_credit_history_interaction><cross><age_deciles><credit_history><Interaction_between_age_deciles_and_credit_history>
   - Reasoning: This interaction captures how different age groups correlate with their credit histories. Younger or older individuals might have distinctive credit patterns which aren't visible when these features are assessed independently.

3. <housing_job_interaction><cross><housing><job><Interaction_between_housing_and_job_status>
   - Reasoning: Housing status combined with job type could provide insight into the financial security and lifestyle of the applicant, which might be a factor in their creditworthiness. For example, those who own homes and have high qualification jobs might be deemed more stable than those renting and having unskilled jobs.

2026-01-30 15:49:10,620 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible steps to generate new features using the available operators, leveraging potential interactions and transformations for improving the model's performance:

1. <employment_credit_combined><cross><employment><credit_history><Interaction_between_employment_and_credit_history>  
   - Reasoning: This interaction can capture valuable information about how different employment statuses might affect credit history differently. It is particularly useful since credit history is a strong predictor of creditworthiness, and employment status can imply financial stability.

2. <adjusted_credit_duration_ratio><multiply><credit_duration_ratio><foreign_worker><Adjusted_ratio_for_foreign_worker_status>  
   - Reasoning: Foreign worker status can significantly impact the perception of risk associated with credit. Adjusting the credit duration ratio by foreign worker status may highlight differences in risk profiles between native and foreign individuals and provide a more nuanced prediction of credit approval.

3. <age_savings_checking_cross><cross><age_deciles><savings_status><checking_status><Interaction_among_age_savings_and_checking_status>  
   - Reasoning: Age, savings status, and checking status collectively capture the financial maturity and security of an individual. This cross feature could expose patterns related to financial management habits and risk levels across different age groups, which are influenced by the presence of savings and checking account statuses.

   This feature captures the relationship between a person's age group and their credit history. Age can significantly influence credit history; for example, certain age groups may be more financially stable, impacting their credit behavior positively or negatively.

2. <employment_savings_interaction><cross><employment><savings_status><Interaction_between_employment_duration_and_savings_status>  
   Employment duration and savings status are likely correlated with financial stability. A longer employment duration may be linked to better savings and financial planning, thus this interaction feature could provide insights into a candidate's creditworthiness.

3. <foreign_worker_checking_cross><cross><foreign_worker><checking_status><Interaction_between_foreign_worker_status_and_checking_account_status>  
   Understanding the relationship between being a foreign worker and checking account status can be pivotal. Foreign workers might have different banking behaviors, which could affect their ability to secure credit. Combining these features can help capture demographic-specific financial situations.

2026-01-30 15:49:25,768 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate features that may help improve the downstream model's performance, it's essential to explore meaningful interactions and combinations that capture aspects of the underlying data patterns. Below are three potential feature engineering steps, each followed by a rationale:

1. <credit_history_employment_cross><cross><credit_history><employment><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_employment_duration>
   - Rationale: Exploring the interaction between credit history and employment duration may offer insights into stability and reliability factors, which could affect credit approval. By examining how different employment durations relate to various credit histories, we can possibly uncover patterns with predictive power.

2. <age_savings_cross><cross><age_deciles><savings_status><Interaction_between_age_deciles_and_savings_status>
   - Rationale: Savings status and age may correlate with different financial behaviors or responsibilities. By analyzing their interaction, we might gain a better understanding of how individuals' saving habits change with age, potentially affecting creditworthiness.

3. <job_housing_interaction><cross><job><housing><Interaction_between_job_status_and_housing>
   - Rationale: The relationship between job status and housing circumstances can reveal important socioeconomic information. For instance, certain job types may align with home ownership or renting, which may impact one's financial situation and credit risk. This feature could capture the socio-economic stability of individuals, which is important for credit evaluation.

   Reasoning: By combining credit history, employment status, job status, and housing interaction, we gain a more nuanced perspective of the individual's financial stability and living conditions. This could provide better insights into their creditworthiness.

2. <adjusted_credit_duration_ratio><multiply><credit_duration_ratio><residence_since><Adjusted_ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration_considering_residence_duration>
   
   Reasoning: Existing credit duration ratio may not reflect the risks associated with longer residence duration. By multiplying credit duration ratio with residence duration, you account for stability, possibly correlating with better repayment abilities.

3. <age_property_magnitude_check><cross><age_property_magnitude_interaction><checking_status><Interaction_between_age_property_magnitude_and_checking_status>
   
   Reasoning: Bringing together age-property interactions and checking status captures both the asset ownership aspects and liquidity status. This combined insight could better predict credit approval likelihood.

These proposed steps aim to create features that provide a deeper understanding by combining existing attributes in ways that could reveal more about risks associated with granting credit.

2026-01-30 15:49:37,434 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, here are three potential feature engineering steps to consider:

1. Feature 1: Combining Employment and Credit History Interaction with Purpose
    - <employment_credit_purpose_cross><cross><credit_history_employment_cross><purpose><Interaction_between_credit_history_employment_and_purpose>
        - Rationale: The interaction of credit history and employment status with the purpose of the credit could help identify credit risk more effectively by considering whether certain credit purposes align with specific employment and credit histories.

2. Feature 2: Adjusting Credit Amount Per Month by Residence Duration
    - <adjusted_credit_amount_per_month><multiply><credit_amount_per_month><residence_since><Adjusted_credit_amount_per_month_considering_residence_duration>
        - Rationale: Adjusting the credit amount per month by the duration of residence could provide insights into the stability of the applicant's financial situation, as longer residence duration may imply higher stability and responsibility.

3. Feature 3: Cross Interactions of Housing and Age Deciles
    - <housing_age_interaction><cross><housing><age_deciles><Interaction_between_housing_status_and_age_deciles>
        - Rationale: The interaction between housing status and age deciles can represent the relationship between an individual's age and their housing situation, potentially indicating financial maturity or preferences, which could influence credit risk assessment.

These steps aim to enhance the predictive power of the model by creating more nuanced features that capture complex relationships within the data.

2026-01-30 15:49:49,540 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that might improve the predictive performance of the downstream model, we can focus on exploiting interactions and ratios among existing features, along with encoding techniques that convert categorical variables into a format suitable for analysis. Here are three potential steps:

1. Create a feature that captures the interaction between foreign worker status and housing type, as these could correlate with financial stability and risk in granting credit.

    
   <foreign_worker_housing_cross><cross><foreign_worker><housing><Interaction_between_foreign_worker_status_and_housing_type>
   

   Reasoning: The intersection of foreign worker status and housing type can reveal critical information about an individual's socio-economic stability, which could potentially impact credit risk assessment.

2. Combine purpose and savings status, as the reason for taking a loan and current savings could further provide insights into the creditworthiness of the applicant. This is a way to evaluate the necessity and financial backing for the loan.

   
   <purpose_savings_interaction><cross><purpose><savings_status><Interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_savings_status>
   

   Reasoning: By understanding the connection between why a credit is requested and the applicant’s savings, a predictive model can gain more nuanced insights into behavior, possibly identifying trends that correlate with the likelihood of default.

3. Encode the job feature to numerical because it can help introduce ordinal information into the model, which may capture patterns related to job stability and credit risk.

   
   <job_encoded><label_encode><job><Numerical_encoding_of_job_status>
   

   Reasoning: By converting job status to numerical form, we align the feature for conventional numerical analysis, potentially making it easier to assess the impact of job quality on credit decisions. This encoding can contribute toward capturing patterns related to employment stability.

2026-01-30 15:49:57,814 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task description and the existing accepted and rejected features, I've devised three potential strategies for generating new features. These strategies aim to leverage interactions and adjustments from existing features while maintaining a focus on categories that might influence creditworthiness predictions.

1. Interaction between credit history and property magnitude:
   - Combining credit history with property magnitude can provide insights into how credit behavior is influenced by property type. This might reveal trends where individuals with certain types of property also exhibit specific credit histories.
   plaintext
   <credit_history_property_interaction><cross><credit_history><property_magnitude><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_property_magnitude>
   

2. Adjusted credit-to-duration ratio considering residence duration:
   - Adjusting the credit-to-duration ratio with residence duration can provide an idea of stability in repayment capabilities. Longer residence might imply financial stability, affecting their risk evaluation.
   plaintext
   <adjusted_credit_to_duration_ratio><multiply><credit_duration_ratio><residence_since><Adjusted_ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration_considering_residence_duration>
   

3. Cross between job status and purpose:
   - Analyzing how job types relate to credit purposes might uncover trends in how people's employment might direct their credit utilization (e.g., skilled professionals might more frequently take loans for new cars while unskilled might do so for other purposes).
   plaintext
   <job_purpose_cross><cross><job><purpose><Interaction_between_job_status_and_credit_purpose>
   

These steps leverage potential interactions and associations between behaviors, individual attributes, and financial stability indicators, possibly improving the model's predictive performance by uncovering nuanced relationships in the data.

2026-01-30 15:50:04,510 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating features that might improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_checking_history_interaction><cross><credit_history><checking_employment_cross><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_checking_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit history with the status of the checking account and employment duration can reveal deeper insights into the financial behavior and stability of the individual, which can be crucial in assessing creditworthiness.

2. <age_duration_ratio><divide><age><duration><Ratio_of_age_to_credit_duration>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of age to credit duration might highlight the maturity level and financial responsibility intensity of individuals over the length of their credit period. This feature might help discern patterns related to the timely repayment capability among different age groups.

3. <purpose_employment_cross><cross><purpose><employment><Interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_employment_duration>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between the purpose for which credit is sought and the duration of employment can provide insights into the financial stability and seriousness of commitment toward fulfilling credit obligations. Different credit purposes might overlap with employment stability in various ways, affecting risk levels.

2026-01-30 15:50:10,691 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we can generate new features with meaningful interactions or transformations of existing features. Below are three proposed steps for feature engineering with a short explanation for each:

1. Credit History and Savings Status Interaction  
   <credit_savings_interaction><cross><credit_history><savings_status><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_savings_status>  
   Explanation: Interactions between a person's credit history and their savings status could provide insights into their financial stability or risk profile. This interaction might capture valuable distinctions in credit-worthiness not visible in individual features.

2. Age Duration Interaction  
   <age_duration_interaction><multiply><age><duration><Product_of_age_and_credit_duration>  
   Explanation: The multiplication of age and duration could highlight the importance of balancing between a loan's duration and the borrower's age, potentially impacting the risk of loan default and a person's stability over the duration of credit.

3. Purpose and Employment Interaction  
   <purpose_employment_interaction><cross><purpose><employment><Interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_employment_status>  
   Explanation: The interaction between the purpose of the credit and employment status can reveal different financial behaviors or risks associated with particular credit uses and employment conditions, which might affect the outcome of receiving credit.

2026-01-30 15:50:16,737 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To enhance predictions, let's focus on meaningful interactions and transformations that capture relationships between existing features. Here are three possible next steps with explanations:

1. Objective: Investigate employment duration's impact on credit decision when coupled with credit history and housing status.
   - Reasoning: Combining employment duration with credit history and housing could provide insights into financial stability and creditworthiness.
   plaintext

2026-01-30 15:50:33,334 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering aimed at improving the downstream model's performance. The proposed steps focus on interactions and transformations that are likely to capture critical information from the data:

1. Interaction between Savings Status and Job
   - <savings_job_interaction><cross><savings_status><job><Interaction_between_savings_status_and_job>
     - *Reasoning*: The interaction between savings status and job type could provide insights into an individual's financial stability and employment quality, which could influence creditworthiness.

2. Credit History and Purpose Encoding
   - <credit_history_purpose_encoded><label_encode><credit_history><purpose><Numerical_encoding_of_credit_history_and_purpose_for_better_model_learning>
     - *Reasoning*: Encoding the credit history and purpose together into a single numerical feature can help the model learn complex relationships between credit behavior history and the reason for credit, which may be indicative of credit risk.

3. Log Transformation of Credit Amount
   - <log_credit_amount><log><credit_amount><Log_transformed_credit_amount_for_reducing_skewness>
     - *Reasoning*: Applying a log transformation to the credit amount could reduce skewness in its distribution and improve the model's ability to learn from this feature, especially if the credit amounts are not normally distributed. This transformation can help in capturing non-linear relationships.

1. <age_credit_duration_interaction><cross><age_deciles><duration><Interaction_between_age_deciles_and_credit_duration>  
   - Reasoning: Combining age deciles with credit duration could capture how individuals of different age groups manage their credit over varying periods. This interaction might reveal insights into the risk associated with borrowers in specific age brackets across different credit durations.

2. <adjusted_savings_ratio><divide><savings_status><credit_duration_ratio><Adjusted_ratio_of_savings_status_to_credit_amount_duration>  
   - Reasoning: By dividing savings status by the credit duration ratio, we can assess how the savings level affects the comparison of credit amount relative to the duration. This might highlight borrowers who are better equipped financially to handle their credit commitments over time.

3. <foreign_worker_purpose_cross><cross><foreign_worker><purpose><Interaction_between_foreign_worker_status_and_credit_purpose>  
   - Reasoning: Foreign worker status might influence the kind of credit purposes they engage with. This cross-interaction can highlight different risk profiles based on the purpose of the credit requested by foreign workers, which could be significant in understanding credit risk across different demographics.

2026-01-30 15:50:44,909 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for generating new features that could potentially enhance the downstream model's performance:

1. Combining Employment and Job Status  
   - Reasoning: The interaction between employment duration and job status could provide insights into financial stability, which is critical for credit risk assessment.
   - <employment_job_interaction><cross><employment><job><Interaction_between_employment_duration_and_job_status>

2. Ratio of Credit Amount to Average Income  
   - Reasoning: Understanding the credit amount in relation to the individual's financial inflow might reveal stress points, and aid in gauging creditworthiness.
   - <credit_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount><credit_amount_per_month><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_monthly_average_income>

3. Interaction Between Housing Status and Savings  
   - Reasoning: The combination of housing situation and savings status can indicate financial security and risk level, serving as an additional lens for assessing creditworthiness.
   - <housing_savings_interaction><cross><housing><savings_status><Interaction_between_housing_status_and_savings_account>

These features are crafted to uncover additional dimensions of credit risk, aiming to enhance the ability of the model to differentiate between those likely to repay versus those likely to default.

2026-01-30 15:50:54,588 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, let's consider feature engineering steps that capture potential interactions or transform existing features in meaningful ways. Here are three proposed next steps:

1. Combine Credit Information with Purpose and Employment Duration:
   - <credit_purpose_employment_cross><cross><credit_amount_per_month><purpose><Interaction_between_credit_amount_per_month_and_credit_purpose>: This captures the relationship between the amount being credited monthly for specific purposes, allowing the model to differentiate between varying credit needs for different purposes.
   - <credit_employment_ratio><divide><credit_amount><employment><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_employment_duration>: This feature examines the ratio between credit amount and employment duration, potentially highlighting cases where credit amount might be disproportionate to the applicant's employment stability.

2. Age and Financial Status Interaction:
   - <age_savings_property_cross><cross><age_deciles><savings_employment_interaction><Combined_interaction_of_age_savings_status_and_employment_status>: This feature explores deeper interactions between age, savings, and employment status, potentially capturing nuanced financial habits related to different age groups.

3. Incorporate Housing Information:
   - <housing_credit_interaction><cross><housing><credit_history><Interaction_between_housing_status_and_credit_history>: This feature assesses how housing choices might influence or correlate with one's credit history, potentially highlighting different risk profiles based on ownership, rent, or living for free.
   - <housing_monthly_credit_ratio><divide><credit_amount_per_month><housing><Ratio_of_monthly_credit_to_housing_status>: By examining the ratio of monthly credit amounts to housing status, the model can understand if certain housing statuses are consistently associated with higher or lower credit burdens.

These steps aim to uncover hidden patterns by focusing on significant financial indicators like credit usage patterns, employment stability, and age demographics, further aiding credit decisioning models' accuracy.

2026-01-30 15:51:03,123 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance, let's focus on interactions between features based on economic reasoning and correlations that might exist in the dataset.

### Proposed Feature Generation Steps:

1. Combining credit history with foreign worker status:
   - <credit_history_foreign_worker_interaction><cross><credit_history><foreign_worker><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_foreign_worker_status>
   - *Reasoning:* The interaction between an individual's credit history and their status as a foreign worker might reveal significant insights into credit approval, as foreign workers may face different financial opportunities or hurdles.

2. Integrating employment with housing status:
   - <employment_housing_interaction><cross><employment><housing><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_housing_status>
   - *Reasoning:* The stability of both employment and housing might synergistically indicate an individual's capacity to receive credit since secure employment could potentially lead to more stable housing situations and vice versa.

3. Combining purpose with credit history:
   - <purpose_credit_history_interaction><cross><purpose><credit_history><Interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_credit_history>
   - *Reasoning:* The purpose of credit combined with credit history can help in understanding risks associated with lending for specific purposes. Certain credit purposes might be perceived differently based on one's credit past, impacting lending decisions.

These proposed features aim to capture richer, context-specific information that could allow the model to distinguish between applicants more effectively, ultimately improving prediction performance on whether an individual receives credit. Each of these interactions is chosen to leverage potentially meaningful economic and social correlations in the data that are not directly captured by the base features alone.

   - Reasoning: The relationship between an individual's credit history and their employment duration/status could provide insights into their ability to manage credit and generate income, which is crucial for loan eligibility.

2. <adjusted_duration><multiply><duration><residence_since><Adjusted_duration_based_on_residence_period>
   - Reasoning: By considering how long a person has lived in their current residence alongside the loan duration, we can better understand stability and predict credit risk. Longer residence duration might imply reliability, and cross-referencing this with loan duration could be insightful.

3. <employment_savings_checking_interaction><cross><employment><savings_status><checking_status><Interaction_between_employment_savings_and_checking_account_status>
   - Reasoning: The combined interaction of employment duration, savings status, and checking account status can provide a holistic view of financial stability, influencing both risk assessment and creditworthiness. This feature can reveal whether stable employment relates to better savings and checking habits.

   - Rationale: The interaction between the duration of residence and credit amount per month offers additional insights into financial stability. This might improve prediction accuracy as longer residence duration often relates to better credit repayment behavior.

2. <employment_status_duration_cross><cross><employment><duration><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_credit_duration>
   - Rationale: Employment status combined with the credit duration can indicate a person's financial commitment and stability, which can be crucial in determining creditworthiness. For example, individuals in stable employment with longer durations may be more likely to repay.

3. <foreign_worker_checking_interaction><cross><foreign_worker><checking_status><Interaction_between_foreign_worker_status_and_checking_account_status>
   - Rationale: Combining foreign worker status with checking account status might reveal patterns in financial behavior of foreign workers as compared to locals, which could be significant for assessing credit risk. It helps in understanding if foreign workers manage their finances differently.

   Reasoning: Normalizing the credit_duration_ratio can help in scaling the feature to a standard range. This could improve model convergence and performance, as models that rely on gradients might benefit from normalized inputs.

2. <age_housing_interaction><cross><age_deciles><housing><Interaction_between_age_decile_and_housing_status>  
   Reasoning: Creating an interaction feature between age_deciles and housing can reveal patterns or behaviors in credit approval based on how age groups and housing types interact, which might not be obvious when looking at each feature independently.

3. <employment_duration_encoded><label_encode><employment><Numerical_encoding_of_employment_duration>  
   Reasoning: Converting employment categorical data into numerical format can allow the model to more effectively utilize this information in its calculations, especially in algorithms that assume numerical input data.

    - Reasoning: This feature may help capture the borrower’s stability or continuity in residence, potentially indicating reliability in repaying credit based on longer residence being possibly positively correlated with creditworthiness.

2. <age_property_magnitude_savings_cross><cross><age_property_magnitude_interaction><savings_employment_interaction><Combined_interaction_of_age_property_magnitude_and_savings_employment>
    - Reasoning: Combining multiple interactions involving age, property magnitude, and savings with employment could provide insights into the financial situation and asset stability of the individual, possibly correlating to their creditworthiness.

3. <employment_duration_encoded><label_encode><employment><Numerical_encoding_of_employment_duration>
    - Reasoning: Encoding employment duration into a numerical format could improve the model's ability to differentiate between varying levels of employment stability. Longer employment durations might suggest a higher likelihood of credit acceptance due to perceived stability.

2026-01-30 15:51:29,977 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations, aimed at improving the downstream model's performance:

1. Create a feature that combines credit history and purpose:
   - Rationale: Credit history and purpose interact to influence credit availability. People with good credit histories may be more likely to get loans for heavier investments like real estate or business, while those with poorer credit histories may seek credits for more immediate needs like furniture or appliances.
   
   <credit_purpose_interaction><cross><credit_history><purpose><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_purpose>
   

2. Create a feature that represents the interaction between job status and savings status:
   - Rationale: The stability of employment (job status) combined with savings status can provide insights into the applicant's financial stability. People with stable jobs and significant savings may be considered lower risk.
   
   <job_savings_interaction><cross><job><savings_status><Interaction_between_job_status_and_savings_status>
   

3. Create a feature that combines age bins and housing status:
   - Rationale: Different age groups may have different tendencies or capabilities for owning property, which can impact credit decisions. Integrating age with housing status can highlight these distinctions.

2026-01-30 15:51:38,118 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <age_residence_savings_interaction><cross><age_deciles><savings_status><Interaction_between_age_deciles_and_residence_savings_status>: Creating an interaction feature between age deciles and savings status could help capture combined effects of these two aspects on creditworthiness. For people with similar age ranges, the type of savings status might have different implications, and capturing this interaction can provide additional predictive power. This feature was not rejected in previous attempts, and the concept leverages successful features such as <age_deciles><bin><age><Age_bins_for_risk_assessment>, as such interactions have proven beneficial for capturing unique combinations. 

2. <credit_purpose_salary_interaction><cross><purpose><credit_amount_per_month><Interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_average_salary_per_month>: This interaction can uncover relationships between the stated purpose of the credit and the applicant's monthly financial commitment capacity, providing a deeper understanding of their ability to manage the credit for specific purposes. This cross interaction utilizes the credit's purpose and the credit amount per month to generate potential insights into consumer behavior and repayment likelihoods.

3. <foreign_worker_housing_interaction><cross><foreign_worker><housing><Combined_interaction_of_foreign_worker_status_and_housing_status>: This interaction accounts for potential differences in credit risk between foreign and domestic workers based on housing status. This is important, as foreign worker status could influence both risk and housing preferences, with different implications for credit evaluation. This feature has not been explicitly tried yet, but similar housing and personal attribute cross-interactions in other attempts show potential value not to be overlooked in evaluating this demographic factor.
