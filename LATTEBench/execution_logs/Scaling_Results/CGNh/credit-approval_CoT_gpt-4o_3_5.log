2026-01-31 10:47:04,259 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly, let's explore three potential feature engineering steps to improve the prediction performance for determining credit card application success. Here are some useful features one might create:

1. <AgeCategorical><bin><Age><This_feature_buckets_age_into_categories,_potentially_improving_model_performance_by_reducing_noise_from_age_variability_and_highlighting_age-related_patterns_in_credit_card_success.>

   - Reasoning: By binning the age into categories, the variability of the data can be reduced, possibly capturing age-related trends that influence credit card application success.

2. <CreditScoreDebtRatio><divide><CreditScore><Debt><This_feature_represents_the_ratio_of_credit_score_to_debt,_providing_indications_of_how_well_an_individual's_credit_score_compliments_or_justifies_their_debt_level.>

   - Reasoning: A higher ratio might indicate effective debt management relative to one's creditworthiness (credit score), which could be a strong predictor of credit card application success.

3. <IndustryEthnicityInteraction><cross><Industry><Ethnicity><This_feature_combines_industry_and_ethnicity,_capturing_potential_variations_in_credit_card_application_success_across_different_industry_ethnicity_combinations,_which_might_be_relevant_for_targeting_and_segmenting_groups.>

   - Reasoning: Capturing interaction between industry and ethnicity might reveal specific segments where credit card success is higher or lower, aiding in more directed marketing or understanding biases, which can prove beneficial in model learning.

2026-01-31 10:47:09,402 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features:

1. <BankCustomerMarriedCross><cross><BankCustomer><Married><This_feature_combines_bank_customer_status_and_marital_status_to_capture_any_patterns_related_to_credit_card_application_success_that_may_vary_between_single_and_married_bank_customers.>

   Reasoning: Since both bank customer status and marital status might influence financial behaviors or stability, this cross feature could uncover patterns that are significant predictors of credit card application success.

2. <AgeEmployedInteraction><multiply><Age><Employed><This_feature_multiplicatively_interacts_age_with_employment_status_to_capture_dynamics_where_age_and_employment_jointly_influence_credit_card_application_success.>

   Reasoning: Combining age and employment status in a multiplicative interaction might reveal differences in credit card application outcomes that simple linear models could miss. Older employed individuals might have different success likelihoods compared to younger employed individuals.

3. <IncomeZScore><zscore><Income><This_feature_standardizes_income_to_remove_the_effect_of_extreme_values_or_variability_that_may_obscure_patterns_related_to_credit_card_application_success.>

   Reasoning: Standardizing income via Z-score transformation can help normalize the effect of potentially wide income ranges, allowing the model to more effectively discern patterns where income affects credit card application success.

   Reasoning: Different industries may have varying levels of economic stability and income, which can affect credit scores. Understanding the average credit score within each industry might reveal patterns related to credit card application success within those sectors.

2. <EmployedIncomeInteraction><multiply><Employed><Income><This_feature_interacts_employment_status_with_income_to_capture_how_the_combination_of_being_employed_and_having_a_higher_income_impact_credit_card_application_success.>

   Reasoning: Employment and income are critical indicators of financial stability. By interacting these two features, this may highlight the influence of economic stability on credit card application success, with employed individuals having higher incomes possibly more likely to be successful in their applications.

2026-01-31 10:47:33,515 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps to generate new features:

1. \<AgeIncomeInteraction\><multiply>\<Income\>\<AgeCategorical\>\<This_feature_interacts_scaled_income_with_age_categories_to_capture_how_earnings_at_different_life_stages_influence_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_highlighting_age-specific_financial_behaviors.\>
   - Reasoning: By interacting income with age categories, we can explore how income levels at different age stages influence credit card application success. This interaction might reveal age-specific financial behaviors or constraints.

2. \<EthnicityCreditScoreMean\><groupbythenmean>\<Ethnicity\>\<CreditScore\>\<This_feature_calculates_the_average_credit_score_per_ethnicity,_highlighting_potential_disparities_or_advantages_in_credit_scores_across_different_ethnic_groups_that_may_impact_credit_card_application_success.\>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the average credit score per ethnicity might reveal disparities in creditworthiness across ethnic groups, which could be relevant for predicting credit card application success.

3. \<MaritalEmploymentInteraction\><cross>\<Married\>\<Employed\>\<This_feature_combines_marital_status_with_employment_status_to_explore_the_complex_interplay_of_family_commitments_and_work_status_on_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_revealing_patterns_among_couples_vs._single_applicants.\>
   - Reasoning: Combining marital status with employment status might capture unique patterns where family commitments and work status jointly influence credit card application outcomes, potentially providing insights into the financial stability of different groups.

2026-01-31 10:47:38,989 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps to generate new features with the goal of improving model performance in predicting credit card application success:

1. <IncomeCitizenshipCross><cross><Income><Citizen><This_feature_combines_income_with_citizenship_status_to_identify_patterns_in_credit_card_application_success_based_on_the_interplay_of_financial_earning_and_citizenship,_potentially_highlighting_immigration_status_related_financial_behaviors.>

   *Reasoning*: The combination of income and citizenship status might reveal unique patterns where individuals from certain citizenship backgrounds demonstrate varying financial earning behaviors that could influence credit card success. For example, individuals with higher incomes and different citizenship statuses might have different credit card application success rates.

2. <YearsEmployedMaritalCross><cross><YearsEmployed><Married><This_feature_combines_years_employed_with_marital_status_to_identify_patterns_that_capture_the_influence_of_long-term_employment_and_married_life_on_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_indicating_financial_stability_and_commitment.>

   *Reasoning*: Investigating the interaction between years of employment and marital status can provide insights into how stable employment over years, combined with marital status, correlates with financial stability and responsibility, which are critical factors in credit card application success.

3. <EthnicityCreditScoreCross><cross><Ethnicity><CreditScore><This_feature_combines_ethnicity_with_credit_score_to_examine_cultural_or_demographic_influences_on_creditworthiness_and_potentially_identify_disparities_that_affect_credit_card_application_success.>

   *Reasoning*: The correlation between ethnicity and credit score might uncover particular demographic trends or disparities in creditworthiness which could influence credit card application success. Understanding these patterns can enhance targeting and recommendation algorithms tailored to diverse ethnic backgrounds.

2026-01-31 10:47:44,117 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps for generating new features using the provided operations, with the aim of improving the predictive performance of the model:

   *Reasoning:* By interacting marital status with income, we can uncover patterns of how being married or single/divorced might affect how income relates to credit card application success. Married individuals might have different spending and saving habits compared to single individuals, which could influence credit card application outcomes. 

2. <CitizenZipCodeCross><cross><Citizen><ZipCode><This_feature_combines_citizenship_status_with_zip_code_to_capture_geographical_patterns_in_how_citizenship_status_affects_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_revealing_localized_social_or_policy_factors.>

   *Reasoning:* Crossing citizenship status with zip code allows us to explore any geographical variations in how citizenship status impacts credit card application success. Different regions may have varying support systems or policies that affect non-citizens, influencing credit outcomes.

3. <IndustryEmploymentStatusInteraction><cross><Industry><Employed><This_feature_combines_industry_with_employment_status_to_capture_how_the_type_of_employment_or_lack_thereof_influences_employment_patterns_and_credit_card_application_success.>

   *Reasoning:* Combining the industry sector with employment status can help identify how being employed or not, within specific industries, impacts credit card application success. Certain industries might offer more stability or benefits, influencing the likelihood of successful credit applications.

2026-01-31 10:47:55,295 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps for generating new features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <EmploymentIncomeCreditScoreCross><cross><Employed><IncomeCreditScoreInteraction><This_feature_combines_employment_status_with_the_interaction_of_income_and_credit_score,_capturing_how_the_combination_of_having_a_job_and_financial_health_might_influence_credit_card_application_success.>

   *Reasoning*: By crossing employment status with the interaction of income and credit score, this feature may reveal how being employed potentially moderates the effect of financial health on credit card application success, shedding light on different behaviors between employed and unemployed individuals.

2. <EthnicAgeCross><cross><Ethnicity><AgeCategorical><This_feature_combines_ethnicity_with_age_categories,_potentially_highlighting_different_age-related_credit_application_patterns_among_various_ethnic_groups,_revealing_group-specific_behavior_or_constraints.>

   *Reasoning*: This involves crossing the ethnic background with age categories to capture age-specific patterns that might differ across ethnic groups. This feature can help illuminate how age-related decisions about credit applications vary among ethnicities.

3. <IndustryEmploymentRank><groupbythenrank><Industry><Employed><This_feature_ranks_employed_individuals_within_their_industries,_capturing_relative_employment_standings_that_may_highlight_individuals_with_greater_career_stability,_which_could_influence_credit_card_application_success.>

   *Reasoning*: By ranking employed individuals within their respective industries, this feature aims to capture an individual's relative standing in terms of employment stability within their sector, which could potentially highlight more stable career paths that influence credit card application outcomes.

2026-01-31 10:48:00,748 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps, applying different operations to improve the predictive model for credit card application success:

1. <EmploymentIncomeCreditCross><cross><Employed><IndustryCreditScoreCross><crossing_employment_status_with_industry_and_credit_score_captures_how_employment_status_modifies_the_effect_of_industry-specific_credit_behavior_on_application_success.>

   *Reasoning:* Combining employment status with industry and credit score may reveal how employment stability interacts with industry dynamics and creditworthiness, potentially uncovering relevant patterns for credit card success.

2. <AgeEmploymentYearsInteraction><multiply><AgeCategorical><YearsEmployed><This_feature_interacts_age_category_with_years_employed_to_capture_the_seniority_and_experience_of_individuals_in_different_age_groups_that_might_influence_their_credit_applications._Certain_age_groups_might_benefit_from_longer_employment_lengths,increasing_their_approval_chances.>

   *Reasoning:* Older individuals with more years of employment might be seen as more financially stable. Exploring the interaction between age categories and years employed could highlight how accumulated work experience affects credit card application outcomes.

3. <GenderMaritalStatusZipCodeCross><cross><Gender><Married><ZipCode><This_feature_combines_gender,_marital_status,_and_zip_code_to_capture_a_three-dimensional_demographic_view_of_the_application_success_rate>

   *Reasoning:* By combining gender, marital status, and geographic location, we can explore whether there are location-based demographic effects influencing credit card application success. This feature could help identify region-specific patterns or biases in outcomes.

2026-01-31 10:48:07,839 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's generate three potential features to improve the model's performance for predicting credit card application success. These features will aim to capture interactions or underlying patterns not directly visible through existing features.

1. Interaction of Income and CreditScore using Employment Status:
   - <IncomeCreditScoreEmployedInteraction><multiply><Income><CreditScore><This_feature_interacts_income_with_credit_score_multiplied_by_employment_status_to_capture_how_employment_potentially_enhances_or_dampens_the_combination_of_earning_ability_and_creditworthiness_in_influencing_credit_card_application_success.>
   
   *Reasoning*: By interacting income and credit score and then multiplying by employment status, we capture how the combination of these factors differs between employed and unemployed individuals, potentially revealing varying impacts on credit card success.

2. AgeGroup and Industry Interaction Encoding:
   - <AgeIndustryInteraction><cross><AgeCategorical><Industry><This_feature_combines_age_groups_with_industries_to_capture_how_age-related_patterns_in_different_industries_may_influence_the_likelihood_of_credit_card_application_success,_highlighting_potential_industry-specific_life-stage_behaviors.>
   
   *Reasoning*: Cross-combining age categories with industry could reveal how different life stages within specific industries affect credit card application success, potentially highlighting industry-specific behaviors or needs.

3. Employment and Marital Status with Drivers License:
   - <EmploymentMaritalDriverLicenseCross><cross><Employed><Married><DriversLicense><This_feature_creates_a_joint_categorization_of_employment_status,_marital_status_and_holding_a_driver's_license_to_explore_how_the_combination_of_work,_relationship_commitments_and_driving_authority_may_jointly_influence_credit_card_application_success.>
   
   *Reasoning*: By cross-combining employment status, marital status, and driver's license holding, we capture the interplay of employment, personal relationships, and independence in impacting credit card application success, which might reveal nuanced socio-economic patterns.

These suggested features are designed to enhance the understanding of relationships between existing attributes and potentially reveal hidden patterns that could influence the model's predictive capabilities positively.

2026-01-31 10:48:13,631 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, each designed to capture different aspects of the data that might be relevant for predicting credit card application success:

1. \<IncomeIndustryZScore><zscore><IndustryIncomeMean><This_feature_standardizes_average_industry_income,_highlighting_outliers_and_extreme_disparities_in_income_across_different_industries_that_may_impact_credit_card_application_success.>
   - Reasoning: By examining how much individual industry incomes deviate from the industry mean, we might uncover industries that significantly differ in terms of income, potentially impacting the likelihood of credit card approval.

2. \<EmployedMarriedCross><cross><Employed><Married><This_feature_combines_employment_status_with_marital_status_to_explore_the_interaction_between_being_employed_and_marital_commitments_on_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_highlighting_stability_in_life_and_finances.>
   - Reasoning: Employment and marriage often interact to affect financial stability and credit decisions. Analyzing this interaction may reveal patterns such as whether stable employment and being married contribute to higher success rates in credit applications.

3. \<CitizenIncomeInteraction><multiply><Citizen><Income><This_feature_interacts_citizenship_status_with_income_to_identify_any_potential_disparities_or_influences_of_citizenship_and_earning_power_on_credit_card_application_success,_highlighting_economic_behavior_related_to_immigration_status.>
   - Reasoning: Interacting income with citizenship status aims to capture how financial power correlates across different citizenship statuses. This interaction might reveal insights into how income levels within specific citizenship groups affect application success, possibly due to socio-economic factors.

2026-01-31 10:48:19,155 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 potential next steps to generate new features that could enhance the prediction of credit card application success:

1. <IncomeEthnicityInteraction><cross><Income><Ethnicity><This_feature_combines_income_with_ethnicity_to_explore_how_income_levels_affect_credit_card_application_success_among_different_ethnic_groups,_potentially_highlighting_economic_behaviors_and_disparities_across_ethnicities.>

   *Reasoning:* Income levels can vary significantly across different ethnic groups, and this interaction may reveal patterns where certain ethnicities, due to historical or socio-economic factors, face different levels of credit card application success depending on their income levels.

2. <EmploymentCreditScoreInteraction><multiply><Employed><CreditScore><This_feature_interacts_employment_status_with_credit_score_to_capture_the_effect_of_employment_on_an_individual's_creditworthiness,_potentially_indicating_how_being_employed_enhances_one's_credit_profile_and_bolsters_credit_card_application_success.>

   *Reasoning:* Employment status and credit score both play crucial roles in credit assessments. By interacting these two variables, we can explore whether the perceived stability from being employed contributes to a higher likelihood of credit card application success, particularly for those with varying credit scores.

3. <AgeMaritalStatusInteraction><cross><AgeCategorical><Married><This_feature_combines_age_categories_with_marital_status_to_capture_how_age_and_relationship_commitments_influence_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_identifying_patterns_based_on_youthful_single_individuals_vs._older_married_applicants.>

   *Reasoning:* Marital status and age are both critical demographic factors. Their interaction could highlight the differences in financial priorities and risk assessments between younger, unmarried applicants and older, potentially more financially stable, married individuals, offering insights into how these factors influence credit card application success.

2026-01-31 10:48:25,482 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps to generate new features that might improve the downstream model's performance for predicting credit card application success. These suggestions are based on uncovering relationships that could provide additional insights into applicants' profiles and their likelihood of success.

1. <EmployedIncomeDebtInteraction><multiply><Employed><IncomeCreditScoreEmployedInteraction><This_feature_interacts_employed_status_with_income_and_creditworthiness_to_capture_variations_in_financial_behavior_and_creditworthiness_among_employed_applicants,_potentially_highlighting_dynamics_that_affect_credit_card_application_success.>
   - Reasoning: By interacting employment status with income and existing income-credit-employment interaction, this feature seeks to capture how being employed influences the combined effect of earning ability and creditworthiness on credit card application success. It might identify nuances where employment amplifies or moderates the impact of financial standing.

2. <IndustryDebtMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScoreDebtRatio><This_feature_calculates_the_average_credit_score_debt_ratio_per_industry,_highlighting_differences_in_how_well_credit_score_justifies_debt_within_industries_that_may_influence_credit_card_application_success.>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the average CreditScoreDebtRatio per industry could reveal disparities in how industries manage credit and debt. This information might spotlight industries where employees are better at maintaining balanced financial health, thus affecting credit card application success.

3. <MarriedEthnicityCross><cross><Married><Ethnicity><This_feature_combines_marital_status_with_ethnicity_to_capture_how_relationship_commitments_and_ethnic_background_jointly_influence_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_highlighting_patterns_among_cohabiting_ethnic_communities.>
   - Reasoning: Cross-referencing marital status with ethnicity might reveal cultural or demographic patterns impacting credit card success rates. Certain ethnic groups may have different financial behaviors or community support systems, potentially impacting credit outcomes, particularly in relation to marital stability.

   - Reasoning: Multiplying prior default status with credit score can provide insight into whether individuals with past credit issues have managed to improve their creditworthiness. This interaction can reveal patterns in credit application success among applicants who have moved past previous financial difficulties.

2. <IncomeEthnicityMean><groupbythenmean><Ethnicity><Income><This_feature_calculates_the_average_income_per_ethnicity_to_capture_any_earnings_disparities_among_various_ethnic_groups_that_may_impact_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_highlighting_group-specific_economic_challenges_or_opportunities.>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the mean income for each ethnic group will help identify income disparities that might affect credit card application success. By understanding these patterns, we can recognize socio-economic barriers faced by particular ethnic communities in accessing financial products.

   - Reasoning: Crossing marital status with industry can help detect how personal life and profession together affect financial behaviors. Certain industries might have work-life dynamics that influence financial stability and creditworthiness differently for married versus single applicants, uncovering patterns helpful in targeting credit products.

2026-01-31 10:48:40,049 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<AgeIndustryEthnicityInteraction\><cross><AgeIndustryInteraction><Ethnicity>\<This_feature_combines_age_industry_interaction_with_ethnicity_to_capture_more_granular_patterns_in_credit_card_application_success_based_on_life_stage,_professional_sector_and_ethnic_background._It_aims_to_amplify_the_effect_of_age_industry_patterns_with_ethnic_cultural_background>

   *Reasoning*: Combining age with industry segments has already been considered valuable. Adding ethnicity into this mix may reveal additional nuances in application success patterns due to socio-cultural factors.

2. \<IncomeYearsEmployedInteraction\><multiply><Income><YearsEmployed>\<This_feature_interacts_income_with_years_employed_to_explore_the_combination_of_experience_and_financial_standing._It_potentially_identifies_individuals_with_both_stable_income_sources_and_long_work_histories_as_candidates_with_higher_credit_card_application_success>

   *Reasoning*: Income and years of employment are both strong indicators of financial reliability and stability. Exploring their interaction may help capture candidates with steady and increasing income due to longer career tenure.

3. \<BankCustomerDriversLicenseCross\><cross><BankCustomer><DriversLicense>\<This_feature_combines_bank_customer_status_with_drivers_license_possession_to_identify_individuals_with_access_to_financial_services_and_transportation_flexibility,_potentially_higher_likelihood_of_credit_card_application_success>

   *Reasoning*: Being a bank customer suggests some level of financial integration and stability, while having a driver's license can indicate a willingness to manage personal responsibilities. Combined, these factors may highlight individuals more likely proactive in applying for credit cards.

2026-01-31 10:48:46,033 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the predictive model's performance for predicting credit card application success:

1. <YearsEmployedIncomeRatio><divide><YearsEmployed><Income><This_feature_represents_the_ratio_of_years_employed_to_income,_capturing_how_experience_and_earning_ability_jointly_influence_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_identifying_consistent_earners>  
   - Reasoning: By calculating the ratio of years employed to income, we attempt to capture how long-term employment correlates with income stability, which might highlight individuals with consistent earning over time and therefore potentially higher credit card application success.

2. <CreditScoreIncomeInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><Income><This_feature_interacts_credit_score_and_income_to_explore_how_financial_health_and_creditworthiness_jointly_influence_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_identifying_worthy_credit_applicants>
   - Reasoning: A multiplicative interaction between credit score and income can reveal individuals who have both high income and good credit scores, potentially indicating strong financial health and higher likelihood of a successful credit card application.

3. <MarriedAgeCreditInteraction><cross><Married><AgeCategorical><CreditScore><This_feature_combines_marital_status,_age_group,_and_credit_score_to_explore_how_family_life,_age-related_financial_behavior,_and_creditworthiness_jointly_influence_the_likelihood_of_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: By crossing marital status, age group, and credit score, this feature aims to capture complex patterns that involve personal lifestyle factors, age-related financial behavior, and creditworthiness, which can be crucial factors influencing credit card application success.

   Reasoning: This feature aims to explore how financial stability linked with marriage can impact credit card success rates, particularly as married individuals may have different spending and saving patterns compared to single individuals.

2. <CreditScoreIncomeZipCodeCross><cross><CreditScore><Income><ZipCode><This_feature_combines_credit_score_and_income_with_zip_code_to_explore_geographical_patterns_of_creditworthiness_and_financial_health,_potentially_highlighting_areas_with_higher_likely_credit_card_application_success_due_to_combined_credit_and_income_factors.>

   Reasoning: This combined feature attempts to capture how location, credit score, and income together could offer insights into areas with higher credit card success rates, bringing into view local economic conditions and their relation to financial behaviors.

3. <YearsEmployedIndustryMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><YearsEmployed><This_feature_calculates_the_average_years_employed_per_industry,_highlighting_the_employment_stability_within_industries_that_may_impact_credit_card_application_success_by_indicating_sectors_with_conventionally_longer_employment_duration.>

   Reasoning: By calculating the average years employed per industry, this feature aims to illuminate industries where employment duration is longer, potentially indicating financial stability that could favorably influence credit card approval rates.

2026-01-31 10:49:05,982 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering using the provided operations. These steps aim to capture intricate relationships and improve the model's predictive performance.

1. <PriorDefaultIncomeInteraction><multiply><PriorDefault><Income><This_feature_interacts_prior_default_status_with_income_to_explore_how_previous_credit_behavior_combined_with_financial_earning_potential_affects_credit_card_application_success._This_may_help_identify_applicants_who_are_financially_stable_despite_past_credit_issues.>

   Reasoning: Interacting PriorDefault with Income could capture how previous credit issues, in conjunction with current income levels, influence the likelihood of credit card application success. Applicants with high income might offset previous defaults, indicating financial recovery.

2. <EthnicityCitizenCross><cross><Ethnicity><Citizen><This_feature_combines_ethnicity_with_citizenship_status_to_capture_how_demographic_and_legal_backgrounds_jointly_influence_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_identifying_cultural_and_policy-related_effects_on_credit_behavior.>

   Reasoning: Crossing Ethnicity and Citizen might highlight differing credit card application success rates based on the interplay between cultural factors and citizenship status, possibly identifying groups that face unique credit challenges or opportunities.

3. <YearsEmployedCreditScoreInteraction><multiply><YearsEmployed><CreditScore><This_feature_interacts_years_employed_with_credit_score_to_explore_how_long-term_work_experience_combined_with_creditworthiness_influences_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_identifying_reliably_earning_candidates_with_strong_credit_profiles.>

   Reasoning: Interacting YearsEmployed with CreditScore could shed light on how prolonged employment and consistent credit behavior contribute to credit card application success. Applicants with extended employment history and higher credit scores might be viewed as more stable and reliable.

### Reasoning:

1. IncomeCreditScoreDebtRatioInteraction: By examining the interaction between income and credit score debt ratio, this feature could highlight individuals who maintain a favorable balance of income and debt obligations. It may identify applicants less burdened by debt relative to their income, thus potentially improving credit card application success.

2. EmploymentAgeStabilityScore: Combining years employed with age categories could reveal which age groups are more stable in their employment, providing insight into long-term employees who might have better financial management skills and thus are more successful in credit card applications.

3. EthnicityIndustryCreditInteraction: By integrating industry and ethnicity interactions with credit score, we aim to capture complex interactions between these factors that could influence creditworthiness and overall application success. This feature could surface specific combinations where certain ethnicities thrive in particular industries, leading to better credit behavior and application outcomes.

2026-01-31 10:49:18,374 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three feature engineering steps that could help improve the model's performance by leveraging available operations and data characteristics:

1. <PriorDefaultCreditScoreEmployedInteraction><multiply><PriorDefault><CreditScore><This_feature_interacts_prior_default_status_with_credit_score_and_employment_status_to_identify_how_previous_credit_behavior_and_current_creditworthiness_combined_with_employment_status_influence_credit_card_application_success.>
   - Reasoning: By multiplying PriorDefault, CreditScore, and Employed, this feature explores how historical credit behavior, current creditworthiness, and employment status jointly influence application success. This may highlight distinctions between applicants with different credit backgrounds and employment statuses, potentially revealing patterns that impact credit card approval.

2. <EthnicityIncomeMean><groupbythenmean><Ethnicity><Income><This_feature_calculates_the_average_income_per_ethnic_group,_highlighting_earnings_disparities_which_may_influence_credit_card_application_success_and_shed_light_on_economic_behaviors_across_ethnicities.>
   - Reasoning: By calculating the mean income per ethnic group, this feature captures average earnings disparities across ethnic backgrounds. Identifying such discrepancies may provide insights into how financial standing across ethnic groups affects credit card approval, potentially revealing systemic biases or economic behavior patterns.

3. <MarriedEmploymentStatusInteraction><cross><Married><Employed><This_feature_combines_marital_status_with_employment_status_to_explore_how_relationship_commitments_together_with_employment_affect_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_indicating_stability_in_both_personal_and_professional_lives_as_an_influencing_factor.>
   - Reasoning: By crossing Married and Employed, this feature examines how the combination of marital and employment status impacts credit card application success. This could shed light on the stability or financial burden conferred by being employed and married, which may influence approval chances.

These engineered features aim to capture complex interactions that might affect credit card applications, potentially improving the predictive power of the downstream model.

### Explanation:
1. IncomeEducationCross: This feature explores how income varies across different education sectors. This could reveal whether individuals working in certain educational fields (e.g., higher education) have income levels that significantly differ from others, which might influence their credit card application success.

2. CreditScoreEthnicityMean: Calculating the average credit score per ethnic group can shed light on potential creditworthiness disparities among different ethnicities. Understanding these patterns can be crucial for a downstream model to avoid bias and improve performance by identifying groups with traditionally high or low credit scores.

3. AgeMaritalStatusCombo: Combining age categories with marital status gives an insight into how individuals' life stage and personal commitments affect credit card applications. This could highlight that younger, single individuals may have different characteristics compared to older, married applicants, thereby allowing the model to tailor its predictions accordingly.

2026-01-31 10:49:34,599 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps for generating new features, leveraging the provided operators and existing features, with an aim to improve the model's predictive performance:

1. <IncomeAgeEmploymentEffect><multiply><Income><AgeCategorical><This_feature_explores_the_interaction_between_income_and_age_categories,_capturing_how_different_earning_levels_at_various_life_stages_may_influence_credit_card_application_success,_potentially_highlighting_financial_maturity_or_constraints_associated_with_different_age_groups.>

   Reasoning:
   This feature captures the interaction between income levels and age categories, which may provide insights into how financial capabilities influence credit card application success at different life stages. Younger individuals may have different financial behaviors than older individuals with similar income levels.

2. <CreditDebtIncomeEffect><multiply><CreditScoreDebtRatio><Income><This_feature_represents_the_combination_of_credit_score_debt_ratio_and_income,_providing_a_measure_of_creditworthiness_relative_to_earning_potential._This_could_help_identify_individuals_balancing_credit_and_income_influencing_credit_card_success.>

   Reasoning:
   By exploring the interaction between the credit score debt ratio and income, this feature aims to highlight candidates with a balanced or favorable relationship between their credit status and financial earnings. This ratio might reveal individuals likely to manage credit card commitments efficiently.

3. <IndustryMaritalInteraction><cross><Industry><Married><This_feature_captures_how_being_in_various_industries_interacts_with_marital_status,_potentially_illuminating_dynamics_where_professional_and_personal_lifestyles_jointly_influence_credit_card_application_success_patterns_among_couples_and_single_individuals_in_different_sectors.>

   Reasoning:
   This feature aims to explore the cross-effects between industry sectors and marital status. It could uncover how certain industries might interact with personal commitments, like marriage, to influence credit card application success. This might reveal industry-specific financial behaviors or constraints influenced by marital status.

Reasoning:

1. IncomeDebtRatio: This feature divides income by the credit score to debt ratio, offering insights into the individual's ability to handle debts given their income. By analyzing this ratio, it becomes possible to gauge if high earners who also maintain their credit obligations are more likely to succeed in credit card applications.

2. YearsEmployedZScore: By standardizing the 'YearsEmployed' feature, the feature's extreme values are moderated, facilitating the detection of significant patterns related to stability and consistency in employment, factors that often positively influence creditworthiness and card application outcomes.

3. EthnicityIncomeInteraction: Although similar features have been previously rejected, revisiting this interaction might still yield potential insights as current feature space dynamics could highlight economic behaviors and disparities affecting credit outcomes based on ethnic backgrounds. Given its intricate nature, changes in feature interactions might affect its influence on prediction.

2026-01-31 10:49:47,676 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that may help improve the downstream model's performance for predicting credit card application success:

1. <IncomeByAgeGroupMean><groupbythenmean><AgeCategorical><Income><This_feature_represents_the_average_income_for_each_age_group,_capturing_potential_variations_in_financial_standing_among_different_life_stages_that_might_influence_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Different age groups may have distinct earning potential and financial responsibilities, with these differences influencing credit card application success. Calculating the mean income by age group can highlight variations and help capture patterns related to age-specific financial stability.

2. <EmploymentIncomeCreditScoreInteraction><multiply><Employed><IncomeCreditScoreEmployedInteraction><This_feature_combines_employment_status_with_the_interaction_of_income_and_credit_score,_providing_a_comprehensive_view_on_how_these_three_critical_factors_jointly_influence_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: The feature will provide insights into how different combinations of income, credit score, and employment status influence credit card application success. It emphasizes the importance of being employed in amplifying the effects of income and creditworthiness.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreDeviation><groupbythenstd><Industry><CreditScore><This_feature_calculates_the_standard_deviation_of_credit_scores_within_each_industry,_providing_information_on_the_variance_in_creditworthiness_across_individuals_in_the_same_professional_sector,_which_may_affect_credit_card_application_outcomes>
   - Reasoning: Understanding the variability of credit scores within an industry can reveal insights into sector-specific credit behaviors. High variability could indicate significant disparities in creditworthiness amongst individuals in the same field, potentially impacting credit card application success probabilities.

2026-01-31 10:49:57,723 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential steps for generating new features:

1. <EmployedCreditScoreDebtRatioInteraction><multiply><Employed><CreditScoreDebtRatio><This_feature_interacts_the_employment_status_with_the_credit_score_to_debt_ratio_to_capture_how_being_currently_employed_influences_the_relationship_between_credit_quality_and_financial_liabilities,_highlighting_how_employment_status_might_enhance_or_mitigate_risks_associated_with_credit_applications.>

   Reasoning: This feature aims to explore the relationship between employment and an individual’s ability to manage their financial liabilities relative to their credit score, which could potentially identify candidates who are financially stable even when facing significant debts.

2. <IndustryMaritalIncomeMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><Income><This_feature_calculates_the_average_income_for_each_industry_and_marital_status_combination_to_identify_patterns_where_marital_commitments_may_lead_to_increased_financial_capability_in_specific_professional_sectors,_potentially_highlighting_income_stability_as_a_factor_for_credit_card_application_success.>

   Reasoning: Considering both industry and marital status simultaneously allows for identification of income variations within married and single/divorced individuals in different sectors, potentially revealing financial stability linked to marital commitments in specific professions.

3. <CitizenCreditScoreZScore><zscore><CreditScore><This_feature_standardizes_credit_scores_on_the_basis_of_citizenship_status,_highlighting_potential_differences_in_credit_behavior_or_access_among_citizens_vs._non-citizens_that_might_influence_credit_card_application_success.>

   Reasoning: Normalizing the credit score based on citizenship groups could reveal distinctions in credit behavior or access to financial resources, which are vital factors in predicting credit card application success among different citizenship categories.

2026-01-31 10:50:09,171 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features with the goal of potentially improving the downstream model's performance:

1. Combine Employment with Credit Score-Related Features:
   This step aims to capture the combined effect of being employed with one's creditworthiness and financial stability. Given the importance of credit score and employment status in determining financial reliability, this interaction could reveal individuals whose stability in both aspects leads to higher success rates.

2. Age and Income Interaction:
   Capturing the interaction between an individual's age category and income could highlight financial behaviors or constraints at different life stages that impact credit card application success. This feature might reveal trends such as younger individuals with high income vs. older individuals with stable average income.

   
   <IncomeAgeInteraction><multiply><Income><AgeIndustryInteraction><This_feature_combines_income_with_age-related_patterns_invarious_industries,_capturing_how_earning_potential_changes_at_different_life_stages_can_influence_credit_card_application_success.>
   

3. Citizenship and Income Interaction:
   Exploring the interaction between income and citizenship status can uncover any discrepancies or influences that citizenship may have on earning potential, which could significantly impact success outcomes. This insight might reveal systemic differences or advantages affecting credit behaviors.
