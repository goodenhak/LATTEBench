You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, no checking, >=200, 0<=X<200]
- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 60], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 21.1717, Std = 11.9703
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [all paid, existing paid, critical/other existing credit, delayed previously, no credits/all paid]
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [used car, radio/tv, new car, business, furniture/equipment, repairs, other, education, retraining, domestic appliance]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [250, 18424], Q1 = 1393.0, Median = 2302.5, Q3 = 3926.0, Mean = 3289.6367, Std = 2873.9759

- employment: Present employment, in number of years. (categorical), categories = [1<=X<4, <1, >=7, 4<=X<7, unemployed]
- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9983, Std = 1.1182

- residence_since: Present residence since X years (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.8567, Std = 1.1067
- property_magnitude: Property (e.g. real estate) (categorical), categories = [car, life insurance, real estate, no known property]
- age: Age in years (numerical), range = [19, 75], Q1 = 27.0, Median = 33.0, Q3 = 42.0, Mean = 35.7750, Std = 11.8799
- other_payment_plans: Other installment plans (banks, stores) (categorical), categories = [bank, none, stores]

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
Possible next three steps:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [used car, radio/tv, new car, business, furniture/equipment, repairs, other, education, retraining, domestic appliance]
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, no known savings, 100<=X<500, >=1000, 500<=X<1000]

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, no checking, >=200, 0<=X<200]
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, no known savings, 100<=X<500, >=1000, 500<=X<1000]

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
