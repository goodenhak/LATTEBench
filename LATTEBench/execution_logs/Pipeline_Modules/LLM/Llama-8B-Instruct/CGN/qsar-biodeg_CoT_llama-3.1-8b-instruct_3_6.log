2026-01-28 02:58:26,924 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <ratio_of OH>diff<HyWi_B(m), SdO>: This new feature calculates the ratio of percentage of oxygen atoms (OH) to HyWi_B(m) and takes the difference with SdO. This could be useful as OH and SdO are both related to the presence of oxygen atoms in the molecule.
2. <Smallest atoms bin>nCp<groups of C%, nHM, nO>: This new feature bins the atoms by their frequency and counts the number of groups of three or more neighboring C% atoms in the molecule, alongside the counts of nHM and nO. This could help model the heterogeneity of molecular structure.
3. <Psi_i_A,tangent>log<SM6_B(m)> :  This new feature calculates the logarithm of SM6_B(m) and takes the tangent of Psi_i_A. This could be useful as the logarithm transformation stabilizes variances, while the tangent function adds non-linearity. 

Note: These features are generated by analyzing the relationships between original features and the nature of the data, aiming to improve the performance of the downstream model.

2026-01-28 02:58:33,635 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

Step 1: Encoding categorical features

The feature nX is categorical, and we can encode it using label encoding to create a new feature. We'll also use the nN feature, which is numerical.

 <new_nX><label_encode><nX><new_nX_label_encoded_description>

Step 2: Combining features using cross

We can combine the features C% and nCp using the cross operator to create a new feature.

 <new_CP><cross><C%><nCp><new_CP_cross_description>

Step 3: Creating a new feature using logarithmic transformation

We can apply a logarithmic transformation to the feature SM6_L to reduce the effect of outliers. We'll create a new feature that represents the log of SM6_L.

 <new_log_SM6><log><SM6_L><new_log_SM6_log_description>

These steps involve encoding categorical features, combining numerical features, and applying a logarithmic transformation to reduce the effect of outliers. The reasoning behind these steps is to create new features that can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model by capturing more information from the original data.

2026-01-28 02:58:57,841 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. <NssssC_rank>rank<NssssC>nN-N<Rank of NssssC feature among N-N-N pairs>: This step uses the rank operator to rank the NssssC feature among all rows, considering the number of N-N pairs. The idea is that if a molecule has a high NssssC value and is also among the top-ranked N-N-N pairs, it may indicate a stronger biodegradability signal.

2. <SdssC_log>log<SdssC><Log-transformed SdssC feature, used to capture extreme values>: This step applies the log operator to the SdssC feature, which is a sum of E-states. By taking the log, we can capture extreme values and create a more symmetrical distribution, which may help the model better capture non-linear relationships.

3. <C%_one_hot>one_hot<C%>nHM<nHM Feature Encoded based on C% Category>: This step uses the one_hot operator to encode the nHM feature based on the C% category. The idea is that nHM may interact differently with different C% categories, and by encoding nHM based on C%, we can create a new feature that captures these interactions.

These steps are chosen to address potential issues with the current features:

* The NssssC feature is a count of a specific type of atom, but its relationship with the response variable may be non-linear. By ranking it among N-N-N pairs, we can capture a potential interaction.
* The SdssC feature is a sum of E-states, which may have extreme values. By taking the log, we can create a more symmetrical distribution and capture non-linear relationships.
* The nHM feature is a count of heavy atoms, but its relationship with the response variable may depend on the C% category. By encoding nHM based on C%, we can create a new feature that captures these interactions.

2026-01-28 02:59:05,901 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <Numerical_Similarities>cross<SM6_L><C%>: Calculate the dot product of SM6_L and C% to create a new feature that captures the relationship between molecular structure and chemical composition.

2. <NssssC اخت<anylabel_encode?><nArCOOR>: Label encode nArCOOR and combine it with NssssC using a cross operator to generate a new feature that captures the relationship between nitro groups and saturated carbon atoms.

3. <HyWi_B(m)>log<SM6_L>: Take the logarithm of SM6_L and combine it with HyWi_B(m) to create a new feature that captures the relationship between molecular structure and the logarithmic slope of spectral moments.

These steps are motivated by the following reasoning:

- The first step creates a new feature that captures the relationship between molecular structure (captured by SM6_L) and chemical composition (captured by C%). This can be useful in downstream classification tasks.
- The second step combines a categorical feature (nArCOOR) with a numerical feature (NssssC) to create a new feature that captures the relationship between nitro groups and saturated carbon atoms. This can be useful in tasks where understanding the relationships between different types of molecular structures is important.
- The third step combines a numerical feature (HyWi_B(m)) with a logarithmic transformation of another numerical feature (SM6_L) to create a new feature that captures the relationship between molecular structure and the logarithmic slope of spectral moments. This can be useful in tasks where understanding the relationships between different molecular properties is important.

1. <SdssC_ratio_SdO><ratio><SdssC><SdO>This feature calculates the ratio of SdssC to SdO, which may help to identify the relationship between the two features. SdssC represents the sum of dssC E-states, and SdO represents the sum of dO E-states.

2. <SpMax_A_cosine_nCb_-><cosine><SpMax_A><nCb_->This feature calculates the cosine similarity between the leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix (Lovasz-Pelikan index) and the number of substituted benzene C(sp2). This may help to identify patterns or relationships between the two features.

3. <C__rank_nO><rank><C__><nO>This feature calculates the rank of the percentage of C atoms among the number of oxygen atoms. This may help to identify the relative importance of C atoms compared to oxygen atoms in the molecule.

Note: These are just suggestions and may need to be adjusted or combined with other features to improve the performance of the downstream model.

2026-01-28 02:59:27,290 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features you provided, here are 3 possible next steps to generate features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. NewSentive_C<categorical_feature>SpMax_L<new_feature_description>
   The goal of this new feature is to understand the interaction between the chemical sensitivity (in form of binary classification labels) and the molecular structure properties like SpMax_L. Label encoding the target variable will provide an additional dimension enriching the input space which will help the model in learning the underlying relationships better.

2. <numerical_feature>minmax<i>HYWi_B(m)<new_feature_description>
   To normalize the army of continuous MOE descriptors, we transform Hywi_B(m) into appropriate scale. This normalised value may help handling the curse of dimensionality and increase model performance on data with a large number of features.

3. C-026<cubec>C-026<new_feature_description>
   Introducing cubic relation on a strong predictor like C-026 will expose the model towards learning more complex interactions and relationships between this feature and other features. This could be effective because cubic relationship will enable the model to capture non-linear relationship between this feature and the target variable which may not be captured by simple linear/mutual interactions.

2026-01-28 02:59:36,446 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <SpPosA_B(p)_encoded><label_encode><SpMax_L>: This step applies label encoding to the feature SpMax_L, which is a numerical feature, to convert it into a categorical feature. This is a common technique to convert numerical features into categorical features that can be used in models that require categorical inputs. The encoded feature SpPosA_B(p)_encoded is then used as a new feature.

2. <C%_binned><bin><nCp>: This step applies binning to the feature nCp, which is a numerical feature, to convert it into a categorical feature. The feature C%_binned is then created by using the binned nCp feature. This can help to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and reduce overfitting.

3. <SpMax_L_grouped><groupbythenmean><nO><nCb-><SM6_L>: This step groups the data by the feature nO and nCb- and takes the mean of SM6_L within each group. The resulting feature SpMax_L_grouped is then created by aggregating the SM6_L feature over the groups. This can help to create new features that capture the interaction between different features in the dataset.

These steps aim to create new features that can help improve the performance of the downstream model by:

* Encoding numerical features into categorical features
* Reducing the dimensionality of the feature space
* Capturing the interaction between different features in the dataset

2026-01-28 02:59:46,282 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided data and features, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Create a new feature that combines the information of two molecular descriptors

>NewFeature_JDxSpMax_L>cross<J_Dz(e)<sqrt>SpMax_L<Composite feature that captures the relationship between the Balaban-like index and the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix>

This new feature combines the information of two molecular descriptors, J_Dz(e) and SpMax_L, by taking their square root and then calculating the cross product. This can help capture the complex relationship between these two features and potentially improve the model's performance.

2. Encode categorical information for a numerical feature

<n_new_Crt­nCrt<label_encode>nX<Interpret the number of X atoms in terms of readiness for biodegradation>

This new feature encodes the categorical information of the number of X atoms as a binary label, which can help improve the model's ability to distinguish between different classes of molecules.

3. Use a groupbythen operator to create a new feature that summarizes the variability of a set of features across categories

>NewFeature_SdssCV<SdssC<groupbythenstd>nO_F03COCross_att<N-common_N<Measure the variability of SdssC values across categories of nO and F03[C-O]>

This new feature uses the groupbythenstd operator to measure the variability of SdssC values across categories of nO and F03[C-O]. This can help capture the degree of scattering of SdssC values within different subgroups, which can be useful for distinguishing between molecules that are ready and not ready for biodegradation.

2026-01-28 03:00:07,162 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Encoding Chemical Structure Features
sql
<nCb_-encoded><label_encode><nCb_->Encoded nCb_-values>

Reasoning: nCb_- is a numerical feature representing the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) atoms. Encoding this feature using label encoding may help the model capture the relationships between this feature and the target variable. This could improve the model's performance by reducing the impact of the local optima and capturing more nuanced relationships.

2. Scaling High-Varied Numerical Features
sql
<TI2_L_scaled><zscore><TI2_L>

Reasoning: TI2_L is a numerical feature with a relatively high standard deviation (2.0367). Scaling this feature using z-score normalization may help stabilize its impact on the model and prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model's predictions. This could improve the model's robustness and performance.

3. Capturing Relationships between Ring Structure and Biodegradability
sql
<nCrt><cross><SdO>

Reasoning: nCrt is a numerical feature representing the number of ring tertiary C(sp3) atoms, while SdO is a numerical feature representing the sum of dO E-states. By crossing these two features, we may capture relationships between the ring structure and biodegradability. This could provide valuable insights into the underlying chemistry of the molecules and improve the model's performance.

These three steps aim to address different aspects of the data:

1. Encoding a numerical feature to improve relationships with the target variable
2. Scaling a high-varied numerical feature to stabilize its impact on the model
3. Capturing relationships between ring structure and biodegradability by crossing two features.

2026-01-28 03:00:17,232 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Create a new feature by taking the ratio of two molecular descriptors:

NssssC_ratio><ratio><NssssC><SpMax_L><New feature that represents the ratio of the number of atoms of type ssssC to the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix, can help identify molecules with a stronger carbon framework>

This step aims to create a new feature that captures the relationship between the number of atoms of type ssssC and the molecular structure's overall organization, which might be relevant for predicting biodegradability.

2. Encoding the presence/absence of specific functional groups as numerical features:

B01_CBr><numerical_feature><B01[C-Br]><nX><new feature that represents the number of bromine atoms when C-Br is present at topological distance 1, can help identify molecules with specific functional groups>

This step uses the label_encode operator to convert the categorical presence/absence of C-Br at topological distance 1 into a numerical feature, making it easier for the model to learn from this characteristic.

3. Creating a new feature that captures the similarity between the molecular structure and another molecule in the dataset:

SM6_B_m_similarity><cross><SM6_B(m)><nArCOOR><new feature that represents the similarity in spectral moments of order 6 between the current molecule and those with aromatic esters, can help identify molecules with similar biodegradability properties>

This step uses the cross operator to combine two numerical features into a new feature that represents their similarity, which might be relevant for identifying molecules with similar properties related to biodegradability.
