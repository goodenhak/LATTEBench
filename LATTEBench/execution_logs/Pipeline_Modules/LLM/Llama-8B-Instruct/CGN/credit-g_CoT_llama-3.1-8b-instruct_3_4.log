2025-11-10 00:09:45,390 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Interaction between continuous features and categorical features
	new_feature_name<equal><credit_amount><label_encode><checking_status>Interaction between credit amount and checking status may help model capture the non-linear relationship between the two features.

2. Transformation of numerical features
	new_feature_name<log><credit_amount>Transforming credit amount using log function may help model capture the compressing effect of high values.
	new_feature_name<absolute><duration>Transforming duration using absolute function may help model capture the magnitude of duration.

3. Grouping and aggregation of categorical features
	background_features<groupbythenmean><credit_history><purpose>Extract the group mean value of credit history and purpose features.
	background_features<groupbythenmax><age><num_dependents>Extract the group max value of age and num_dependents features.

Explanation:

* Step 1 aims to create an interaction feature between a continuous feature (credit_amount) and a categorical feature (checking_status) to help the model capture the non-linear relationships between the two features.
* Step 2 applies transformations to numerical features (credit_amount and duration) to help the model capture the relationships between features that are dominated by high-value categories.
* Step 3 applies grouping and aggregation to categorical features (credit_history, purpose, age, num_dependents) to extract meaningful group statistics that can help the model capture the relationships between categorical variables.

1. One-Hot Encoding of Categorical Features
The purpose category seems to be a mix of binary and categorical values. We can use one-hot encoding to convert this into a numerical feature. 
<New_Is_New_Car_One_Hot>one_hot<purpose>purpose_is_new_car cops into a new binary feature indicating whether the purpose is new car or not.

2. Encode Categorical Features as Classical Numerical Features
We apply label encoding to convert categorical features to numerical features with specific bins of values and we create a new feature 
<New_Community_Employment >bin< employment >as | 0<=X<4 | new feature with value label 0 for 4ltX<7, 1 for >=7&Xlt4, 2 for Xt<4 .

3. Two New Numerical Features by Higher Order operators

2025-11-10 00:09:58,213 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Interaction between purpose and credit_amount
 New feature captures the combination of purpose and credit_amount, which can indicate the complexity of credit use.
    <purpose_cross_credit_amount> <cross> purpose credit_amount This feature calculates the cross products between different categories of purpose and credit amounts, to explore the relationship between the complexity of credit use and loan outcomes. 

2. Encode checking_status using label_encoding
   Inaccurate or missing categories can be addressed by label encoding the checking_status.
   <checking_status_label_encode> <label_encode> checking_status This feature converts the ordinal categories of checking_status into a more informative form, addressing the unknown category effectively and makes the model receive more detailed information about those data.

3. Extract age band
   This feature can be used to extract an age band by dividing the age into bands rather than using continuous age.
   <age_band> <bin> age This bin feature variable creates band bins for age, aiming to take demographic information about the customers and processed the sensitivity between a younger demographic, that derives higher probability of liability probability.

2025-11-10 00:10:09,169 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible next steps to generate features:

1. Extract interaction between categorical and numerical features
<interaction XOR checking_status feature_amount>feature_interaction_XORizing_types, crosses the categories of checking_status with credit_amount to see if the type of existing checking account affects the credit amount.
2. Encode categorical features along with their numerical values
<credit_amount label_encode credit_history>credit_history_label_encode_with_amount, uses label encoding to transform the categorical credit_history feature, and then appends the numerical value of credit_amount to each encoded category.
3. Group by employment and calculate mean of duration
<employment><groupbythenmean>duration_employment_groupbymean, uses the groupbythenmean operator to calculate the mean duration of people in different employment categories, as a way to see if people in certain employment categories tend to have longer or shorter credit durations.

Explanation for these steps:

We're aiming to create new features that capture interactions between categorical and numerical features, encode categorical features with additional information, and group features by a categorical feature and calculate a summary statistic on the numerical feature. These new feature steps can help improve the model's ability to capture the patterns in the data and make more accurate predictions.

1. interaction XOR: By crossing the categories of a categorical feature with a numerical feature, we can see if there's a significant interaction between the type of checking account and the credit amount. This can help us capture complex relationships in the data.
2. label encode with numerical value: By encoding categorical features along with their numerical values, we can preserve the order information of the categories, while also including the numerical values of the categories. This can help the model understand the specific values of categorical features and their relationships to other features.
3. groupbythenmean on duration: The groupbythenmean operator allows us to group the data by employment type and compute the mean duration for each group. This can help the model learn the average credit duration patterns for different types of employment, which may be useful in credit risk assessment.

These new features can improve the model's performance by capturing more complex patterns in the data and providing the model with more relevant information to make accurate predictions.

2025-11-10 00:10:15,518 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible next steps to generate features:

1. <credit_amount><log><credit_amount><credit_amount,some of the high credit amounts may have multiple cancelling effects which needs to be addressed>

    Reasoning: The feature credit_amount has a large range and its effects on the model may be non-linear, especially when some of the high credit amounts have a negative effect. Taking the log can help reduce the effect of large credit amounts and may improve model performance.

2. <duration><abs><duration><duration, absolute difference may be useful when comparing with some other features>

    Reasoning: The feature duration is numerical and the absolute difference between the duration and other features may provide additional insights. For example, if the duration is high compared to the duration in a specific category, it may indicate a higher credit risk.

3. <employment><one_hot><existing_credits><employment categories and existing credits categorization may provide complementary information>

    Reasoning: Both features employment and existing_credits are categorical and may provide different types of information about the borrower. One-hot encoding the employment categories and using it along with existing_credits may help capture interactions between these two features, which may be useful for the model.

2025-11-10 00:10:23,397 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. checking_status_status_level<log><checking_status><credit_amount><new feature capturing the strength of the checking status in relation to credit amount>
2. credit_amount_debt_ratio<concat><other_parties><existing_credits><new feature capturing the ratio of debt to credit amount>
3. duration_dependency_ratio<div><duration><num_dependents><new feature capturing the dependency ratio of the person>

These steps are chosen based on the following reasoning:

1. The first step creates a new feature checking_status_status_level by taking the log of the checking_status feature. This can help to reduce the impact of the non-linear relationships between checking_status and credit_amount. The log transformation can also help to reduce the effect of outliers in the data. By concatenating the credit_amount feature, we can create a new feature that captures the relative importance of credit amount to the level of the checking status.
2. The second step creates a new feature credit_amount_debt_ratio by concatenating other_parties and existing_credits. By taking the number of other parties and existing credits as the numerator and the credit amount as the denominator, we can create a feature that captures the debt ratio of the person. This feature can help to improve the model's performance by providing additional information about the person's financial obligations.
3. The third step creates a new feature duration_dependency_ratio by dividing duration by num_dependents. By capturing the ratio of the duration of employment to the number of dependents, we can create a feature that captures the dependency ratio of the person. This feature can help to improve the model's performance by providing additional information about the person's financial security and ability to manage debt.

2025-11-10 00:10:28,736 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. checking_status<bin><credit_amount> Depository status binarized credit amount: This feature captures the relationship between the checking status and credit amount, which may indicate the potential risk of lending. A customer with a lower checking status may be more likely to receive credit if they have a higher credit amount.
2. duration<log> Duration in log scale: Transforming the duration into a logarithmic scale may help to reduce the skewness of the distribution and improve the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships.
3. personal_status<one_hot><personal_status> and other_partieslament<personal_status> Encoding personal status and combining with other parties feature: One-hot encoding the personal status feature can help to capture its categorical relationships with the target variable. Additionally, combining this feature with the other parties feature may provide more insights into the creditworthiness of the customer.

Note: These are just potential suggestions, and you should experiment with different feature engineering strategies to find the most effective approach for your specific use case.

2025-11-10 00:10:47,837 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. <existing_credits_4><label_encode><personal_status> existing_credits_status_code_encode

This step converts the existing_credits_4 categorical feature into a numerical label encoded feature based on the personal_status feature. This can help to capture the interaction between the two features and improve the model's performance. The reasoning behind this step is that the existing_credits_4 feature may have different meanings depending on the personal_status, and by encoding it as a label, we can capture these nuances.

2. <savings_status><bin><credit_amount> savings_status_thresholded

This step converts the savings_status categorical feature into a numerical binary feature based on the credit_amount. This can help to capture the relationship between the two features and improve the model's performance. The reasoning behind this step is that the savings_status may have different thresholds depending on the credit_amount, and by binning the savings_status based on the credit_amount, we can capture these relationships.

3. <duration><zscore><existing_credits> duration_standardized

This step standardizes the duration feature using the z-score method based on the existing_credits feature. This can help to normalize the duration feature and improve the model's performance. The reasoning behind this step is that the duration feature may have different scales depending on the existing_credits, and by standardizing it using the z-score method, we can capture these differences and improve the model's ability to generalize.

2025-11-10 00:10:54,204 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features provided, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. Interaction between credit history and savings status
   Similar credit histories and savings statuses may have a higher chance of receiving a credit. Using the sigmoid function, we can create a feature that captures the interaction between credit history and savings status:
   <>sigmoid<credit_history><savings_status>Interactions captured by sigmoid function between credit history and savings status.

2. Number of existing contracts and its categorization
   We can create a new feature by categorizing the number of existing contracts (existing_credits) and providing complementary information about employment categories (existing_credits_4). Using the cos operation and concat, we can create a feature that captures the interaction between the number of existing contracts and its categorization:
   <>cross<existing_credits><existing_credits_4>Interactions captured by cos operation between the number of existing contracts and its categorization.

3. Capturing the aggregate value of personal status and the number of dependents
   The number of dependents (num_dependents) and personal status (personal_status) may have a significant impact on the likelihood of receiving a credit. We can capture the aggregate value of personal status and the number of dependents by transforming them into numerical values. Using the label_encode operation, we can convert personal_status into numerical values. Then, using the bin operation, we can categorize the number of dependents based on the binned numerical values of personal_status:
   <>bin<num_dependents><label_encode<personal_status>>Capturing the aggregate value of personal status and the number of dependents by categorizing the number of dependents based on the binned numerical values of personal_status.
