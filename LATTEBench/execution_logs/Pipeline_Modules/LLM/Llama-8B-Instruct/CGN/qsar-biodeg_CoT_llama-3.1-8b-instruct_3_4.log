2026-01-28 02:44:43,238 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operations:

1. Generated Feature 1: F04_CN_LogRatio
   <F04_CN_LogRatio>log<SM6_L><SM6_B(m)><new_feature_description: Log ratio between 4th order frequency of C-N and spectral moments of order 6 from Laplace and Burden matrices weighted by mass>
   This step aims to generate a new feature that captures the relationship between the frequency of specific molecular structures and the spectral moments of order 6 from different matrices, which might help the model better understand chemical properties and improve its performance.

2. Generated Feature 2: SpMax_MatrixRatio
   <SpMax_MatrixRatio>cross<SpMax_L><SpMax_B(m)><new_feature_description: Ratio between leading eigenvalues from Laplace and Burden matrices weighted by mass>
   This step involves generating a new feature by taking the ratio between the leading eigenvalues from the Laplace and Burden matrices. This might help the model to differentiate between chemicals with varying molecular structures and weights, potentially improving its ability to predict biodegradability.

3. Generated Feature 3: F03_C_Negatio_NHDon
   <F03_C_Negatio_NHDon>negate<concat<F03[C-N], extract min label from set <nHM F01[N-N] F04[C-N] C% nCp nO F03[C-N] SdssC HyWi_B(m) LOC SM6_L F03[C-O] nHDon SpMax_B(m) Psi_i_A nN SM6_B(m)>><new_feature_description: Negative difference between frequency of C-N and minimum of select molecular properties and counts>
   This step involves creating a new feature that aims to represent the difference in frequency of C-N bonds and the minimum of various molecular properties (e.g., counts of certain types of atoms or bonds). The goal is for the model to recognize when there are differences between these properties and use it for better predictions.

Each of these new features incorporates different aspects of the molecular properties and counts, which can potentially provide the model with more insights to improve its performance in predicting biodegradability.

2026-01-28 02:44:50,709 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the molecular descriptors and target variable, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Rank encoding of heavy atoms
   <nHM> <rank> <nHM> <NssssC> <new_feature_description: rank encoding of heavy atoms to capture their impact on nssssC>

   This feature takes into account how the number of heavy atoms ranked against the number of atoms of type ssssC.

2. Numerical descriptors ratio
   <SpMax_L> <ratio> <J_Dz(e)> <new_feature_description: ratio of SpMax_L and J_Dz(e)>

   This feature compares the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix with the Balaban-like index from Barysz matrix weighted by Sanderson electronegativity, possibly indicating a relationship between these two features and affecting the downstream model's performance.

3. Square of difference of percentage of C atoms and number of oxygen atoms
   <C%> <subtract> <nO> <C%> <new_feature_description: square of difference of C% and nO, focusing on the influence of oxygen and carbon atoms.>

   This feature can capture the complementary and potentially important relationship between the percentage of C atoms and the number of oxygen atoms in a chemical compound.

These feature engineering steps may help improve the downstream model's performance by transforming the features into more informative and relevant representations of the data, enabling the model to better capture the relationships between the chemical properties and the target variable.

2026-01-28 02:45:03,311 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <New_Biodegradable_Ratio>cross<SpMax_L><C%>Creates a ratio feature that represents the proportion of biodegradable chemicals for a given SpMax_L value, which may help the model capture the relationship between molecular structure and biodegradability.
2. <Nitrogen_Rank>rank<nN><nO>Extracts the rank of nitrogen and oxygen atom counts, which may help the model capture the importance of these elements in the molecular structure for biodegradability.
3. <Distance_Contrast>abs<SM6_L><SpMax_L>Creates a contrast feature that represents the absolute difference between the Spectral moment of order 6 from Laplace matrix (SM6_L) and the Leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (SpMax_L), which may help the model capture the relationships between different molecular properties and biodegradability.

These steps use various operators and features to create new features that may help improve the downstream model's performance. The first step uses the cross operator to create a ratio feature, the second step uses the rank operator to extract the rank of nitrogen and oxygen atom counts, and the third step uses the abs operator to create a contrast feature.

2026-01-28 02:45:07,995 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the feature descriptions and the dataset, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <MeanAtomicElectronegativityFragmentation><target_encoding><nO><NssssC><new_feature_description>
   This new feature combines the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me) from the data with the number of heavy atoms (nHM) and the number of atoms of type ssssC (NssssC) using target encoding. This can help the model learn that certain types of atoms or fragments are more relevant when predicting the number of oxygen atoms (nO).

2. <HydrogenDonor>sq<LogPseudoconnectivity_Smean><nHDon><SpMax_A><new_feature_description>
   This new feature squares the log pseudoconnectivity Smean index (Psi_i_A) and multiplies it with the number of donor atoms for H-bonds (N and O) (nHDon) and the leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix (Lovasz-Pelikan index) (SpMax_A). This can help the model learn about the relationships between hydrogen bonding, pseudoconnectivity, and molecular structure.

3. <RingCount>cross <N-073><B04[C-Br]><new_feature_description>
   This new feature combines the presence/absence of C-Br at topological distance 4 (B04[C-Br]) with the number of ring tertiary C(sp3) (nCrt) and the presence/absence of Ar2NH / Ar3N / Ar2N-Al / R..N..R (N-073) using a cross operation. This can help the model learn about the relationships between different molecular fragments.

Please note that the new_feature_description can be adjusted based on the actual feature descriptions and the dataset to better describe the relationships between the features.

2026-01-28 02:45:16,243 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and operators, here are three possible next steps to generate features that can potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Encode categorical features
	* Labels county_episode (numerical), X (numerical) -> county_episode_le<bin><X>
		+ This creates a binary encoded feature representing the values of the county_episode and X features. The binary encoding can potentially help the model learn more complex patterns and relationships between the categorical features and numerical features.
2. Compute ratio of molecular descriptors
	* SpMax_L, J_Dz(e) -> ratio_from_spmax_to_jdz<ratio><SpMax_L><J_Dz(e)>, ratio of SpMax_L to J_Dz(e) in chemical's molecular descriptors
		+ This feature can help the model learn the relative importance of the eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) compared to the Balaban-like index from the Barysz matrix weighted by Sanderson electronegativity (J_Dz(e)).
3. Use PSI_i_A as a factor in a groupbythen* operation
	* Psi_i_A Psychology_A, C% -> groupby_Psi_i_A_then_mean Psychology_A<groupbythenmean><Psi_i_A><Psychology_A>, average importance of Attached or Bonds groups, variance weighted by log employing from PSI_i_A and elemental composition C% with symmetry [10%]
	+ This feature can help the model capture the relationship between the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index (Psi_i_A) and the presence of Attached or Bonds groups ( Psychology_A). The groupbythenmean operator will compute the mean value of Psychology_A for each unique value of Psi_i_A.

2026-01-28 02:45:23,771 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1.  Encoding mean electronegativity by class: 
<scaled_electronegativity_label><label_encode><Me><SdssC>  # Label encoding of scaled electronegativity (Me) by the number of dssC E-states (SdssC) to help model understand difference between classes.

2.  Extracting number of fluorinated atoms and calculating the ratio:
<fraction_of_Fluorinated><cross><N-073><SM6_L><SdO>  # Average multiplicity of non-hydrogen atoms at topological distance 1 has been extracted into two separate features (N-073 and its label-encoded version) and a ratio feature was created of the Laplace matrix (SM6_L) and SdO.

3. Capturing chemical structure at varying topological distances:
<topology_distance_score><cross><nCb-><B01[C-Br]>  # A binary feature was created based on the topological distance between the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) and the presence of bromine atoms at a specified topological distance.

These next steps try to improve the downstream model's performance by:

* Creating new features that incorporate interactions between different molecular descriptors and classes
* Capturing the chemical structure at varying topological distances, which can help the model learn to recognize patterns in the data
* Label encoding mean electronegativity by class to help the model understand the difference between classes.

2026-01-28 02:45:31,142 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Create a ratio feature of heavy atoms to total atoms: 
One way to incorporate the number of atoms into the model is to create a ratio feature that represents the proportion of heavy atoms to total atoms. This could be useful because it might highlight molecules with a high proportion of heavy atoms, which could be more likely to be biodegradable. 

 //</numeric_ratio><onelabel_encode><number_of_heavy_atoms><number_of_total_atoms><number of heavy atoms ratio to total atoms>

2. Use logarithmic scaling of topological distances: 
We can explore different scaling of topological distances as features such as F01[N-N], F04[C-N], F03[C-N], F03[C-O] and nCIR, where large topological distances are more likely associated with lower values of these features. Thus, applying logarithmic scaling might make our features more informative.

CANCEL<log><F01[N-N]><F01[N-N] log scaled>

3. Use the ratio of leading eigenvalues from Laplace and adjacency matrices: 
We have two different leading eigenvalue features (SpMax_L and SpMax_A). Their ratio could potentially provide useful information as it would indicate the relative strength of the molecular connectivity as described by the adjacency matrix versus its strength  as described by the Laplace matrix.

<leading_eigenvalue_ratio><divide><SpMax_L><SpMax_A><ratio of Laplace and adjacency matrix leading eigenvalues>

2026-01-28 02:45:41,937 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Interaction between chemical structure and molecular descriptors
   Apply cross operator to combine a numerical molecular descriptor (SpMax_A) with a categorical feature (nO). This can help the model capture non-linear effects between the molecule's structure and its biodegradability properties.
   <SpMax_ABINncrossSPMax_AnO翠struction feature>

2. Temporal dynamics of chemical properties
   Use lag operator to extract a new feature that represents the change in a numerical molecular descriptor (SM6_L) over time. This can help the model learn patterns in the temporal relationships between the molecular property and the biodegradability outcome.
   <SM6_LagSM6_Ltime_change feature>

3. Predicting chemical reactivity using abnormality measures
   Apply zscore operator to a numerical molecular descriptor (J_Dz(e)) to create a new feature representing the molecule's deviation from the expected reactivity value. Then, apply cross operator with a categorical feature (nCp) to measure the effect of the molecule's structure on its reactivity.
   <J_Dz(esqrt)crossJ_DzeabzonormalNPC>

The reasoning behind these steps is to explore and extract additional useful information from the data by performing the following:

- Bridging categorical and numerical features: Using operators like label_encode or bin to convert categorical features to numerical representations can help the model process both types of data consistently.
- Capturing non-linear relationships: Interactions between features, such as cross, allow the model to learn about complex relationships that may not be apparent from individual features alone.
- Extracting temporal dynamics: Using lag or rolling_mean can help the model learn patterns and trends over time that may be relevant for predicting biodegradability.
- Focusing on key descriptors: Selecting particular molecular descriptors, such as those influenced by the presence of halogens (nX) or the concentration of heteroatoms (C%), can help direct the model's attention towards the most critical factors influencing biodegradability.
- Handling non-normal distributions: Scaling numerical features, such as using log or sqrt, can normalize the distribution of the data, benefiting some machine learning algorithms and reducing the effect of outliers.

By introducing these new features, the model may be able to learn more nuanced and effective representations of the data, leading to improved predictions for biodegradability.

Their interaction may reveal additional insights about the relationship between the molecule's atomic connectivity and its atomic masses.

2. Atomic electronegativity and molecular structure
Me <cross> F03[C-N] <new feature representing relationship between atomic electronegativity and molecular structure>

Reasoning: The mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (scaled on Carbon atom) and the frequency of C-N at topological distance 3 may have a relationship that can provide insights into the molecular structure and reactivity. The interaction between atomic electronegativity and molecular structure can help improve the model's understanding of the molecular properties.

3. Applying a non-linear transformation to molecular descriptors
SpMax_L <log> <new feature with log-scale of leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix>

Reasoning: The logarithm of the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) may help to improve the model's sensitivity to extreme values and may reveal non-linear relationships that are not apparent in the original scale. This can lead to better model performance and increased interpretability.
