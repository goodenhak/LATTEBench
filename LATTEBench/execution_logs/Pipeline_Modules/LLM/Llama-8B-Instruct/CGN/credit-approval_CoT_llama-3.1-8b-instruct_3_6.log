2026-01-28 02:20:02,525 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. Interaction between Industry and Ethnicity: The industry a person works in may interact with their ethnicity to influence their creditworthiness. We can create a new feature by categorically encoding the industry and ethnicity features and then using the concat operator to combine them.

<label_encode_Industry,concat</Industry, Ethnicity><IndustryEthnicity_Interact><This feature captures the interaction between industry and ethnicity.>

2. Transforming Debt: The debt feature is already scaled, but it may benefit from additional transformation. We can create a new feature by using the negation operator to negate the debt feature, which can help capture the concept of debt repayment.

<negate></Debt><Debt Repayment Sense>

3. Comparing Age with Employment Years: The age at which someone is employed can be an important factor in determining their creditworthiness. We can create a new feature by subtracting the Age and YearsEmployed features, which can help capture the concept of early employment age.

<subtract></Age, YearsEmployed><Early Employment Age>

These steps create three new features that can potentially improve the downstream model's performance: IndustryEthnicity_Interact, Debt Repayment Sense, and Early Employment Age. The first feature captures the interaction between industry and ethnicity, while the second and third features explore different aspects of debt and employment.

2026-01-28 02:20:15,368 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the feature set provided, here are three possible next steps to generate additional features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. DebtSquaredFeature^square<Debt>
The reasoning behind this step is that the debt feature is a scaled numerical feature, and taking its square may provide a non-linear relationship with the target variable. This can help the model capture the effect of debt on the target variable in a more nuanced way.

2. Ethnicity<label_encode<Ethnicity><numerical_feature><YearsEmployed> -> Ethnicity<bin<Ethnicity><numerical_feature><YearsEmployed>
The reasoning behind this step is that encoding the categorical feature Ethnicity into numerical values may help the model capture the effect of ethnicity on the target variable in a more interpretable way. Additionally, binning the number of years employed by years can create a new categorical feature that may help explain the relationship between ethnicity and years employed.

3. Age<exp<Age>Income -> retirementAge<exp<Age><Income>
The reasoning behind this step is that calculating the exponential of age can help the model capture the effect of age on the target variable in a more non-linear way. Additionally, since the income is already scaled, the exponential of age can help create a feature that is correlated with the likelihood of retirement or being close to retirement, which may have an impact on the target variable.

1. < transformYesNo_labelEncode Married Goods_Married_labelEncoding>;Transform binary 'Married' category to numerical using 'label_encode' from categorical 'Goods' and 'Married' replacement for new feature name for binary variable 'Yes' or 'No'

This can help improve the model's performance by making the data more numeric and easier to work with. The 'Goods' category will be used to create a numerical representation of the binary 'Married' variable.

1. One hot encoding for Industry and Citizen to capture the categorical information.
Industry<one_hot><Industry><new feature captures the categorical information of the industry variable>
Citizen<one_hot><Citizen><new feature captures the categorical information of the citizenship variable>

2. Target encoding for Industry to capture the relationship between the industry and the target variable.
Industry<target_encoding><Industry><target><new feature captures the conditional expectation of the target variable given the industry variable>

3. Rank transform on YearsEmployed to capture the relative information of years employed.
YearsEmployed<rank><YearsEmployed><new feature captures the relative information of years employed>

Note: These are just a few possible next steps, and the actual steps may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. The goal is to create new features that are informative and not redundant with existing features.

These new features can help improve the model's performance by capturing additional information about the individuals in the dataset. The first feature, feature_age_ethnicity, can help the model understand the demographic distribution of the data. The second feature, featureIndustryCode, can help the model identify patterns in employment and profession. The third feature, feature_citizen_credit, can help the model detect potential fraud cases by combining demographic information with credit history.

2026-01-28 02:20:51,570 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and data examples, here are three possible next steps to generate features that may improve the downstream model's performance:

1. AgeDebtRatio experimentedRatio<square><Age><Debt><ratio of age to debt, visualizing age's effect on debt>
   The ratio of age to debt could provide insight into the relationship between age and debt, which might be useful for predicting creditworthiness.

2. CreditScoreCreditScoreRatioExperimental<binaryencode><CreditScore><CreditScore><transforming credit score into a binary feature for experimentation>
   Since the credit score is a critical feature for creditworthiness, experimenting with different encoding schemes can help the model capture non-linear relationships and interactions.

3. groupbythenmean<Industry><YearsEmployed><average years employed in each industry>
   Analyzing the average years employed in different industries could provide context to the model about the typical employment patterns in various sectors, which might be relevant for predicting creditworthiness.

Note that these are just suggestions, and the actual features generated may require further evaluation and fine-tuning to determine their effectiveness in the downstream model.

2026-01-28 02:20:57,218 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <Debt_Ratio>cross<Income><Debt> Convert the debt into categorical indices and cross with income to create a new feature. This feature will capture the relationship between income and debt levels. Reasoning: This feature can help the model understand how income affects debt levels and may help improve the prediction of creditworthiness.

2. <Gender_encode>label_encode<Ethnicity> This will apply the label encoding to 'Gender' and use the encoded values as a new numerical feature. Then, another label encoding will be applied to 'Ethnicity' to encode its categorical values. Reasoning: This can help the model learn the relationships between 'Gender' and 'Ethnicity' and may improve the model's fairness by accounting for potential biases in the dataset.

3. <YearsEmployed>groupbythenmean<PriorDefault> Group the data by YearsEmployed and calculate the mean of PriorDefault for each group. This will capture the relationship between prior default experience and the number of years employed. Reasoning: This can help the model understand the impact of YearsEmployed on the likelihood of default and may improve the prediction of creditworthiness by factoring in an individual's prior experience with debt.

2026-01-28 02:21:02,548 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations:

1. <MarryRatio>equal<Married><BankCustomer><Ratio of being Married vs BankCustomer>
This feature captures the difference in the proportion of individuals who are married versus those who have a bank account. The idea is that a higher ratio might indicate a stronger financial stability, which could be beneficial in predicting success in credit card applications.

2. <PriorDefaultCat>bin<Age><PriorDefault><Age categories based on PriorDefault status>
This feature operates on the categorical PriorDefault status and creates age buckets based on that. The assumption is that the pattern of age distribution within each PriorDefault category might reveal valuable insights into creditworthiness.

3. <CreditScore lurking>log<Debt><CreditScore><Log relationship between Debt and CreditScore>
This feature logs the value of CreditScore to detect non-linear relationships. Some credit scoring models assume linear growth; however, in our case, using a logarithmic transformation may help to better understand the non-linear relationship between Debt and CreditScore.
