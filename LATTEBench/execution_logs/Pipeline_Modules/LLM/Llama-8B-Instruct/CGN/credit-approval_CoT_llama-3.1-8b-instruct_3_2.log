2026-01-28 02:09:12,703 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <BankCustomer_Label_encode_Ethnicity> <- label_encode <BankCustomer> <Ethnicity> - This feature will transform BankCustomer into a numerical variable, similar to a one-hot encoding, but with a more linearly separable transformation. This might help the model learn more about the interactions between BankCustomer and Ethnicity.
2. <PriorDefault_Cosine_CreditScore> <- cosine <PriorDefault> <CreditScore> - This feature will measure the cosine similarity between PriorDefault and CreditScore. The cosine similarity is a measure of how similar two vectors are, and in this case, it will help us understand whether there is a linear relationship between the two variables. 
3. <Income_Exp_YearsEmployed> <- exp <Income> -  The exp operator will exponentiate the Income feature, which will help the model capture non-linear relationships between Income and other variables, such as YearsEmployed.

The reasoning behind these steps is as follows:

* Adding label encoding to BankCustomer will capture its categorical nature and create a new feature that can be treated numerically.
* Measuring the cosine similarity between PriorDefault and CreditScore can provide insight into how these two variables are correlated and whether they are complementary or redundant. 
* Exponentiating Income will allow the model to learn non-linear relationships between Income and other features. 

These features should be reasonably easy to understand, and they may help the model learn more about the interactions between the variables.

2026-01-28 02:09:21,235 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, along with the reasoning behind each step:

1. <credit_score_categorical><bin><CreditScore>
This feature is generated by using the bin operator to discretize the continuous CreditScore feature into categorical bins. This can be useful because credit scores are often used as categorical features in machine learning models, and binning can help to reduce the impact of noise in the data.

2. <prior_default_binary><label_encode><Gender>
This feature is generated by using the label_encode operator to convert the PriorDefault feature into a binary representation, where 0 represents a prior default and 1 represents no prior default. We then label_encode the Gender feature to preserve the categorical information while reducing dimensionality. 

3. <age_group><groupbythenmax><YearsEmployed, Age>
This feature is generated by using the groupbythenmax operator to find the maximum value of the Age feature within each group of YearsEmployed. This can be useful because it can help to capture the relationship between age and employment history, which may be important for predicting creditworthiness.

4. <credit_score_rank><rank><CreditScore>
This feature is generated by using the rank operator to rank the CreditScore feature in descending order (higher credit scores are better). This can be useful because it can help to identify individuals with significantly better or worse credit scores, which may be important for predicting creditworthiness.

5. <marital_status><one_hot><Citizen>
This feature is generated by using the one_hot operator to convert the Citizen feature into a one-hot encoding. Let's create a new feature Marital-status which can help in understanding the relationship between the citizen type and creditworthiness.

6. <income_type><cross><Employed, BankCustomer>
This feature is generated by using the cross operator to create a new categorical feature based on the interaction between Employed and BankCustomer. This can be useful because it can help to capture the nuanced relationships between these two features, which may be important for predicting creditworthiness.

Note that these are just suggestions, and the actual features that are most beneficial for the downstream model will depend on the specific data and model architecture being used.

2. <Age_zscoreDebt>zscore<Age><Debt>Standardized Age, scaled by Debt
This feature standardizes the Age feature using the z-score method, and then scales it by Debt. This can help the model learn the relationship between Age and Debt in a more interpretable way.

3. <Employed_typeConvertEthnicity>label_encode<Employed><Ethnicity>Employed status encoded by Ethnicity type
This feature uses type conversion to encode the Employed status by Ethnicity type. This can help the model learn the relationship between Employed status and Ethnicity in a more interpretable way.

These features are designed to capture different aspects of the data, such as the relationship between CreditScore and Industry, the effect of Age and Debt on the model, and the relationship between Employed status and Ethnicity.

2026-01-28 02:09:34,003 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and data, I will suggest three possible next steps to generate additional features to improve the downstream model's performance. Here are my suggestions:

1. Interaction between Industry and Age: The dataset includes both categorical and numerical features. We can generate a feature that captures the interaction between Industry and Age using the cross operator.
> <Industry_AgeInteraction>cross<Industry><Age><interaction between Industry and Age, capturing complex relationships between job sectors and age>

2. Credit Score vs. Debt Ratio: We can generate a feature that calculates the ratio of Credit Score to Debt, which may provide insight into a person's creditworthiness.
> <CreditScoreToDebtRatio>divide<CreditScore><Debt><ratio of credit score to debt, indicating creditworthiness>

3. Income Rank: We can generate a feature that ranks Income within the group of people with the same Industry using the rank operator. This can help capture the relative income levels within each industry.
> <IncomeRank>rank<Income><Income rank within each industry, capturing relative income levels>

These new features aim to capture more nuanced information about the data, such as complex relationships between categorical and numerical variables, relative creditworthiness, and relative income levels. The first feature may provide insights into how different industries affect credit card success, the second feature can indicate how a person's credit score compares to their debt, and the third feature can capture the relative income position within each industry, which may affect credit card success.

2026-01-28 02:09:43,933 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features provided and the task of predicting credit card success, I will suggest three new feature generation steps to improve the downstream model's performance. The reasoning behind each step is based on the characteristics of the features and the potential relationships between them.

Step 1:
<Gender_Label_Encode_Ethnicity><cross><Industry><new_feature_name_tip_encoding_of_ethnicity_by_industry>
This step involves creating a new feature that is a combination of the encoded ethnicity and industry features. This is a potentially useful feature because it considers the relationship between the individual's ethnicity and their industry, which may impact their creditworthiness.

Step 2:
<Age><square><new_feature_name_age_squares>
This step creates a new feature that is the square of the individual's age. This can be a useful feature because age can be a nonlinear factor in determining creditworthiness, and the squared age may capture this nonlinearity.

Step 3:
<YearsEmployed><cumsum><new_feature_name_cumulative_yrsemployed>
This step involves creating a new feature that is the cumulative sum of the individual's years employed. This can be a useful feature because it captures the individual's employment history, which may be an important factor in determining creditworthiness.

Note that the new feature names, tip_encoding_of_ethnicity_by_industry, age_squares, and cumulative_yrsemployed, will need to be changed to something more meaningful.

2026-01-28 02:09:52,876 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operators:

1. Encode Industry using Label Encoding and then apply Square:
	* <Industry_Label_Encoded><square><Industry>
	* Reasoning: Label encoding ensures that the categorical variable can be used in numerical operations like square, which may help to identify non-linear relationships between the feature and the target.
2. Compute Z-Score of Age and YearsEmployed:
	* <Age_Z><zscore><Age>
	* <YearsEmployed_Z><zscore><YearsEmployed>
	* Reasoning: Z-scoring helps to standardize the scale of the features, which can improve the stability of the model and reduce the impact of outliers.
3. Create Bin of PriorDefault using CreditScore and then apply Log:
	* <CreditScore_Log><log><bin(PriorDefault, CreditScore)>
	* Reasoning: Binning allows us to create a categorical representation of the prior default feature, which can be used in conjunction with the credit score feature to identify non-linear relationships.

2026-01-28 02:09:55,832 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided data and features, here are three possible next steps to generate additional features using the operators:

1. <Debt_Label_Encode(Ethnicity)><log><Debt><new_feature_description>: Use label encoding on the Ethnicity feature to convert it into a numerical format, and then apply the logarithmic function to the Debt feature and the encoded ethnic labels. The resulting feature would capture the relationship between debt levels and ethnic groups in a more meaningful way.

2. <Gender><cross><Employed><new_feature_description>: Use the categorical features, Gender and Employed, in a cross-product operation to create a new binary feature that explores the interaction between being male (or female) and being employed (or not). This feature could potentially reveal insights into the relationship between employment status and creditworthiness.

3. <CreditScore><zscore><Debt><new_feature_description>: Use the z-score operator to standardize the CreditScore feature while also taking into account the Debt feature. The z-score normalizes the CreditScore feature to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, but also captures the relationship between the credit score and debt level. This feature could help the model better understand the context and significance of CreditScore in relation to other variables, particularly Debt, to enhance its predictive capabilities.

Each of these features explores different relationships between the provided features, and by incorporating them into the model, we can gain a deeper understanding of the data and improve the model's performance on the downstream task of predicting successful credit card applications.

2026-01-28 02:10:02,638 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. DebtBurdenFeature<sqrt><Debt><Income><Mean amount of debt paid per year considering individual's income>
This feature will capture the impact of income on the debt burden. It's likely that individuals with higher incomes can afford to pay off their debt more easily, making the burden of debt less severe. By calculating the square root of debt multiplied by income, we can create a new feature that reflects this relationship.

2. EmploymentStabilityFeature<label_encode><Citizen><YearsEmployed><Indicator of employment stability based on citizenship and years employed>
This feature will capture the relationship between employment stability and citizenship. We can use label encoding to convert the categorical variable Citizen into a numerical variable, and then multiply it by YearsEmployed to create a new feature that reflects the individual's employment stability.

3. CreditworthinessFeature<zip><max><Debt><Income><Max debt-to-income ratio to determine creditworthiness>
This feature will capture the relationship between debt, income, and creditworthiness. We can use the max operator to find the maximum debt-to-income ratio, which can be a good indicator of an individual's creditworthiness.

These three features aim to capture different aspects of the data that may be relevant for predicting credit card application success:

* Debt burden and income relationship
* Employment stability and citizenship relationship
* Debt-to-income ratio and creditworthiness

By incorporating these new features, the model may be able to better capture the complexities of the data and improve its predictions.
