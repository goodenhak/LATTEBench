1. <>label_encode<LOCATION věn McCabe Algorithms><Has/No Defect>
This feature is a label encoded version of the McCabe Algorithms (McCabe's line count of code, McCabe 'cyclomatic complexity', McCabe 'essential complexity', McCabe 'design complexity') will be useful to see which features are more significant in relation to defects.

2. <branchCount><diff><v(g)><iv(g)><Difference in Cyclomatic complexity and design complexity>
This feature captures the difference in the complexity of code, which may improve the model's ability to distinguish between modules with and without defects.

3. <branchCount><concat><v(g)><iv(g)><Combined complexity measure>
This feature combines two complexity measures into a single feature, providing a more comprehensive view of a module's complexity and potentially improving the model's accuracy in predicting defects.

2026-01-28 02:28:14,264 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are the next 3 possible feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Calculating effort density:
diff
<locDensity><rolling_mean><loc><t><new feature for perceived cognitive complexity metric that combines code size and effort required to write it)>

This feature calculates the average effort required per line of code, which can help the model understand how complex the code is to write and maintain.

2. Identifying complex blocks of code:
math
<iv_density><groupbythenmax><branchCount><iv(g)><new feature to identify sections with highest design complexity and cyclomatic complexity)>

This feature identifies sections of code with the highest design complexity and cyclomatic complexity, which can indicate areas of the code that need refactoring or are prone to errors.

3. Quantifying commenting effort:
corr
<comment_density><cross><locCodeAndComment><lOComment><new feature to understand the effort required to write comments relative to code size and complexity)>

This feature calculates the percentage of comments in the code, compared to the proportion of comments to code lines, which can help the model understand how much effort developers are putting into writing clear and concise comments.

These features aim to capture additional information about the code that can help the model make more accurate predictions about software defect presence.

2026-01-28 02:28:33,221 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators provided:

1. Combining Halstead's effort and program length features

<>log <log> e l <Effort-to-Length ratio> This feature combines Halstead's effort (e) and program length (l) to create a ratio that might be useful in understanding the effort required to write a given piece of code.

2. Transforming Halstead's design complexity into a categorical feature

>comment_density <bin> locDensity <Number of Code Lines per Unit of Design Complexity> This feature takes the locDensity (perceived cognitive complexity metric) and bins it into categorical features based on the comment density, which might help the model understand how comments relate to design complexity.

3. Ranking McCabe's cyclomatic complexity by Halstead's effort

>rank <rank> v(g) e <Cyclomatic Complexity by Effort> This feature takes the cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and ranks it based on the effort (e) required to write the code, which might provide a more nuanced understanding of how complexity relates to effort.

These new features aim to improve the downstream model's performance by:

1. Creating a ratio that might help the model understand the relationship between effort and program length.
2. Transforming a numerical feature into a categorical feature to help the model understand how comments relate to design complexity.
3. Ranking cyclomatic complexity by effort to provide a more nuanced understanding of how complexity relates to effort.

2026-01-28 02:28:41,129 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations:

1. <iv_density_squared>sqrt<iv(g), v(g)> iv density squared after calculating the average cyclomatic complexity
The reasoning behind this step is that the average cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) can provide insight into the code's overall complexity, and squaring it can emphasize the impact of high complexity on the model's predictions. Taking the square root of the sum of iv(g) and v(g) can provide a measure that indicates whether the code is too difficult to maintain and understand. This feature can help in distinguishing between modules with lower and higher complexity.

2. <iv_density_ratio> ratio<iv(g), v(g)> ratio of iv to cyclomatic complexity, to better understand the design complexity
This ratio feature will allow the model to account for the relationship between iv and v(g) variables, which are both indicators of complexity. Understanding this relationship can help the model to better predict the presence of defects.

3. <comment_density_label_encode>label_encode<comment_density, 8> create a new categorical feature encoding the highest comment density levels
This step will allow the model to learn patterns from the distribution of comment density values. comment_density_label_encode is a measure that categorizes comment density levels into groups (e.g., { 0_0, 0_2, 0_4, ... } ), and label encode converts the result into numerical values that can be trained on by the model, creating a new feature to describe comment density in the context of software quality. This can assist the model in better understanding the impact of comments on the code's quality.

2026-01-28 02:28:47,031 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible next steps to generate features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <expr_voltage><sqrt><v><e><Sqrt of Halstead's 'volume' and effort combined>
This feature combines the Halstead's volume (v) and effort (e) features, which can provide a better understanding of the complexity and potential difficulty of the code. The square root operator is used to normalize the features.

2. <comment_density><bin><locDensity><Bin comment_density by locDensity>
This feature creates a binned comment_density based on the locDensity, which can provide a more nuanced understanding of how comments relate to code size and complexity.

3. <iv_density><cross><iv(g),v(g)><Halstead's 'design complexity' and cyclomatic complexity cross product>
This feature computes the cross product of Halstead's design complexity (iv(g)) and cyclomatic complexity (v(g)). The cross product combines the relationship between these two complexity metrics into a single feature.

2026-01-28 02:29:02,329 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. new_feature_name:<calculate_log<e><e><Feature that captures the ratio of effort to program length> This new feature can capture the relationship between effort and program length, which may be useful for predicting defects. The log function can help reduce the effect of extreme values and make the relationship more linear.

2. new_feature_name:<rolling_mean<5><v><v><Feature that captures the average volume over the past 5 data points> This new feature can capture the trend of program complexity over time. The rolling mean can help smooth out noise and provide a more stable estimate of the trend.

3. new_feature_name:<target_encoding<comment_density><comment_density><Feature that captures the binary encoding of comment density> This new feature can help convert the categorical comment density into a numerical representation, which can be more easily handled by machine learning models. The target encoding can help preserve the information in the original categorical feature.

Note that these are just three possible next steps, and there are many other potential features that can be generated using the given operations. The choice of features ultimately depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the goals of the downstream model.

2026-01-28 02:29:06,701 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and data, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Interacting with continuous features
	* <loc_density><cross><BranchCount><new feature to capture interaction between code size and branching complexity>
	* <iv_density><cross><v><new feature to capture interaction between design complexity and program volume>
	* <e><cross><v><new feature to capture interaction between effort required and program complexity>

Reasoning: These interactions can help the model learn non-linear relationships between the features.

2. Extracting temporal features
	* <t><extract_time><<target_time_feature><new feature to extract time features based on program execution time>
	* <e><extract_time><<target_time_feature><new feature to extract time features based on effort required>
	* <t><rank><branchCount><new feature to capture the rank of program execution time across different branching complexities>

Reasoning: These features can help the model learn about the temporal relationships between the features.

3. Using math operators on numerical features
	* <n><abs><<loc><new feature to capture the absolute difference between total operators and code size>
	* <i><log><v><new feature to capture the log relationship between Halstead's intelligence and program volume>
	* <v><cosine><iv_density><new feature to capture the cosine similarity between program volume and design complexity>

Reasoning: These mathematical operators can help the model learn different types of relationships between the numerical features.

2026-01-28 02:29:12,665 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1.
loc_density,cross,loc,locCode<coming up with a numerical representation of how code size and effort are related>

Goals: understand the relationship between code size and effort, control for effort while studying code size relationships

2.
iv_density,bin,iv(g),k<creating a discrete version of McCabe's 'design complexity' to create bins of complexity levels>

Goals: using MCCabe's design complexity to create a way to separate out high and low complexity lines, that may help improve the model's ability to predict defects on specific parts of the code.

3.
comment_density,label_encode,comment_density<understanding the pattern in when comments are present across different numbers of commenting lines, different design complexities, and when different cyclomatic complexities happen>

Goals: modeling the problem that not all code needs comments, to see what types of comments happen more frequently throughout modules. One would infer that modules with higher cyclomatic complexity, or design complexity, would have comment density that are significantly higher than in less complex modules.

These suggestions use the provided operators to create new features that can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model.

2026-01-28 02:29:22,284 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. <features_with_high_differences-average>sqrt<e><d> Calculate the average of features that have high differences in effort (e) and difficulty (d) estimates 
This feature can help identify modules with high inconsistencies in estimation, potentially indicating areas that require more attention during the review process.

2. <loc-density-categorical_encoding>concato_<comment_density> Generate feature that encodes comment_density as categorical values and concatenates it with loc-density 
This feature aims to capture the nuanced relationship between comment density and code density. The concatenated feature can help the model understand how code complexity and comments are related.

3. <groupbythentrmean/data_type loc>groupbythencumsum/data_type ez iktiv_density] 
Calculate the mean of space_loc across unique ez, then get the cumulative sum.

However, for the final step, I will expand on the 2nd step by providing the full line including spaces for readability.

<features_with_high_differences-average>sqrt<e><d> Calculate the average of features that have high differences in effort (e) and difficulty (d) estimates 

<loc-density-categorical_encoding>concat/data_type loc-density, and comment-density Generate feature that encodes comment_density as categorical values and concatenates it with loc density 

<as_z_score>e modulus<e>lto generate new feature that creates a z-score out of effort(e) and then takes its modulus with instance(l) to understand if it is able to learn differences of effort on different values of lines/en
