2026-01-28 02:41:40,425 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. New feature: J_Dz(e)_normalized, operator: normalize, feature1: SdssC, feature2: Me, new_feature_description: Normalize J_Dz(e) by Me
   J_Dz(e)_normalized normalize SdssC Me 

   Reasoning: The J_Dz(e) feature has a high standard deviation, which might affect the model's performance. By normalizing it with the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me), we might reduce the impact of this feature on the model and improve its performance.

2. New feature: nCb-_(nCRX3+C%), operator: cross, feature1: nCb-, feature2: (nCRX3+C%), feature3: none, new_feature_description: Cross product of nCb- and (nCRX3+C%)
   nCb-_(nCRX3+C%) cross nCb- (nCRX3+C%) 

   Reasoning: The features nCb- and (nCRX3+C%) seem to be related to the presence of certain types of atoms in the molecule. By taking the cross product of these features, we might capture interactions between them that could be useful for the model.

3. New feature: C%(nHM+nArCOOR), operator: plus, feature1: C%, feature2: (nHM+nArCOOR), feature3: none, new_feature_description: Add C% and (nHM+nArCOOR) and C%
   C%(nHM+nArCOOR) plus C% (nHM+nArCOOR) 

   Reasoning: The features C% and (nHM+nArCOOR) might be related to the molecular structure and the presence of certain types of atoms. By adding these features, we might create a new feature that captures the combined effect of these factors on the molecule's properties.

These are just a few examples of possible next steps, and the actual features created and their operators used will depend on the specifics of the data and the problem at hand.

2026-01-28 02:41:54,359 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Feature engineering for chemical similarity: The feature SpMax_L and SpMax_A seem to be related to the molecular structure, which could be indicative of chemical similarity. Let's create a new feature that calculates the difference between these two values.
	* <ChemSim><subtract><SpMax_L><SpMax_A><Chemical similarity feature>

This feature could help the model capture the nuances of molecular structure and improve its ability to distinguish between similar compounds.

2. Scaling of chemical descriptor values: The values of SpMax_L, J_Dz(e), and other descriptors seem to be on different scales. Let's create new features that scale these values using the log operator, which can help to reduce the effect of outliers and improve the model's performance.
	* <SpMax_L_Log><log><SpMax_L><Scale SpMax_L feature>
	* <J_Dz(e)_Log><log><J_Dz(e)>><Scale J_Dz(e) feature>

3. Grouping by molecular properties: The feature C% and nO seem to be related to the molecular properties of the compounds. Let's group the data by these features and calculate the mean and standard deviation of SpMax_L and J_Dz(e) within each group.
	* <Group_Cmean><groupbythenmean><C%><SpMax_L><Mean SpMax_L by C%>
	* <Group_Cstd><groupbythenstd><C%><SpMax_L><Std SpMax_L by C%>

This feature engineering step could help the model to capture the relationships between molecular properties and chemical descriptors, and improve its performance in distinguishing between biodegradable and non-biodegradable compounds.

2026-01-28 02:42:12,950 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. Interaction feature between C% and nO: We can create a new feature that captures the interaction between the percentage of C atoms (C%) and the number of oxygen atoms (nO) using the cross operator. This can help the model capture non-linear relationships between these two features.

C%_nO_intersect>cross<C>%nO>this feature captures the interaction between C% and nO, indicating whether the presence of oxygen atoms is related to the percentage of carbon atoms

2. Encoded categorical feature for Br presence/absence: We can create a new feature by encoding the presence/absence of Br at topological distance 4 (B04[C-Br]) using the label_encode operator. This can help the model learn patterns in the categorical variable.

B04[C-Br]>label_encode<B04[C-Br]>this feature encodes the presence/absence of Br at topological distance 4

3. GroupbythenMedian of SdO by range of SM6_B(m): We can create a new feature that captures the median value of the sum of dO E-states (SdO) within different ranges of the spectral moment of order 6 from Burden matrix weighted by mass (SM6_B(m)) using the groupbythenmedian operator. This can help the model capture non-linear relationships between SdO and SM6_B(m).

SdO_by_SM6_B>groupbythenmedian<SM6_B(m)>SdO>groupbythenmedian SM6_B(m) range this feature captures the median SdO value within each range of SM6_B(m)

These three new features aim to improve the model's performance by capturing interactions between features, encoding categorical variables, and capturing non-linear relationships. The reasoning behind these steps is to create new features that are more informative and relevant to the downstream task, which is to classify chemicals as ready or not ready biodegradable.

2026-01-28 02:42:19,275 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operators:

1. <nN⟩square⟩<SpMax_B(m)⟩ nN squared vs SpMax_B(m) feature interaction
This step aims to create a new numerical feature that represents the squared ratio of nN atoms to the maximum eigenvalue of the Burden matrix (SpMax_B(m)). The square operator is used to amplify the effect of nN and investigate non-linear relationships.

2. <SpMax_B(m)⟩cross⟩<HyWi_B(m)⟩ joint effect of SpMax_B(m) and HyWi_B(m)
This step creates a new numerical feature that captures the interaction between the maximum eigenvalue of the Burden matrix (SpMax_B(m)) and the Hyper-Wiener-like index (HyWi_B(m)). This can help the model detect patterns that may not be visible when analyzing the features individually.

3. <C%⟩bin⟩<nC% ranking feature comparison 
This step transforms the percentage of C atoms (C%) into a binary feature, where values above a certain threshold are encoded as 1, and below the threshold are encoded as 0. This is useful when the model may benefit from comparing the importance of C% to a specific threshold.

These steps try to introduce non-linearity, interaction, and abnormity, which might be beneficial for improving the model's performance.

2026-01-28 02:43:00,922 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given dataset and operators, here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the operators, which can potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Extracting Categorical Information of Chemical Compositions
   *label_encode<nO>nO<Encoded Número of oxygen atoms Binned by Value>*
   This feature helps the model recognize pattern variations in the presence of oxygen atoms across the chemical compositions in the dataset, aiding in determination of readiness for biodegrading. This can be particularly beneficial in situations where similar quantities of oxygen yield varied outcomes due to different compound compositions.

2. Quantification of Biodegradability Indicators
<UserDefined.Square<SM6_B(m)>SM6_B(m)Squared Spectral Moment>*
   SM6_B(m) and other spectral moment values are indicators of the biodegradability of a chemical, as they define the distribution around the molecular weight of a molecule. By taking the square of SM6_B(m), we are potentially extracting additional patterns from the distribution that the model cannot recognize from the linear presentation of the feature alone, thereby adding value to the training process.

3. Integration of Halogen Resistance Indicators with Pseudoconnectivity Indices
<cross<cosine<Psi_i_A>nArNO2 Halogen-containing nitro group pseudoconnectivity indices cross-correlation>*
   This combines a halogen-containing nitro group with a pseudoconnectivity index, capturing complex relationships about how biodegradability indicators interact across compound structures rich in halogen-containing functional groups. It might help the model understand the structural implications of halogen-containing compounds on the overall readiness for biodegradation.

2026-01-28 02:43:11,265 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Interaction term between SpMax_B(m) and HyWi_B(m)
 <SpMax_B_M_HyWi_B_M><cross><SpMax_B(m)><HyWi_B(m)>_Interaction between molecular descriptors SpMax_B(m) and HyWi_B(m)

This feature combines the two molecular descriptors using a cross product, which can help capture complex relationships between them. The resulting feature may be useful for the downstream model, especially if the relationships between SpMax_B(m) and HyWi_B(m) are non-linear.

2. Label encoding of C-026 and interaction with nN
 <C026_Label_Encoded_N_N><numerical_feature><C-026><nN><Interaction between label-encoded C-026 and number of Nitrogen atoms nN>

This feature label-encodes the categorical feature C-026 and then combines it with the numerical feature nN using a cross product. This can help the model capture relationships between the categorical variable C-026 and the numerical variable nN.

3. Groupbythenmean of F03[C-O] by C%
 <F03_By_C_Percent><groupbythenmean><F03[C-O]><C%>_Mean F03[C-O] by C%_

This feature groups the data by the percentage of C atoms (C%) and calculates the mean of the F03[C-O] feature for each group. This can help the model capture the effect of the percentage of C atoms on the F03[C-O] feature, and can be useful if the relationship between C% and F03[C-O] is non-linear.

2026-01-28 02:43:20,859 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Categorical Feature Encoding of SpMax_B(m)
   <SpMax_groupencode><operator>m SpMax_B(m)<label_encode>C Class>
   Reason: The target variable is binary, and the operator groupbythenbin hgives us the bin count for a particular group. The goal is to denote unique combinations of the variables 'm SpMax_B(m)' into categorical features to avoid overspecification to the downstream model.

   A second option: <SpMax_B(m)<label_encode><operator>Baseline SpMax_B(m)>
   This encoding technique is only advanted on categorical features but applies the same idea to numerical features

2. Minimum Signature of Number of Halogen atoms and Pseudoconnectivity Index
   <LOCratio><operator>nXPsi_i_1d><operator>nX><new feature>Combined loc count id ratio/trtd personalize- When a feature has poor autocorrelation or seems poorly correlated to other features, stacking is a good combinatorial approach

2026-01-28 02:43:33,187 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <nN_Negate>nN advertise>nN<negative nitrogen count feature description>: This new feature negates the nN advertise value, which could help the model learn to distinguish between the presence and absence of nitrogen atoms in a more nuanced way.
2. <nCrt_Log>nCrt>nCrt>log-transformed ring tertiary C(sp3) count feature description>: This new feature takes the log of the nCrt value, which could help to reduce the impact of outliers in the nCrt feature and make it more suitable for modeling.
3. <C%_bin)nCp>C%>binned C percentage feature with respect to primary C count description>: This new feature binarizes the C% feature based on its relationship with the nCp feature. This could help the model learn to distinguish between different types of compounds based on their C atom counts.

I chose these operators and features based on the following reasoning:

* nN advertise is a key feature that differentiates between the two classes, and negating its value could help the model learn to distinguish between the presence and absence of nitrogen atoms in a more nuanced way.
* nCrt is a feature that counts the number of ring tertiary C(sp3) atoms, and taking its log could help to reduce the impact of outliers in this feature and make it more suitable for modeling.
* The relationship between C% and nCp could be an important aspect of the data, and binarizing C% based on its relationship with nCp could help the model learn to distinguish between different types of compounds based on their C atom counts.

These are just a few possibilities, and there are many other features and operators that could be explored in order to generate new features that improve the downstream model's performance.
