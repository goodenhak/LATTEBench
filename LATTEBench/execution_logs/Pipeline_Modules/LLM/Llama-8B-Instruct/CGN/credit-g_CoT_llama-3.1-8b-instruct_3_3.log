2025-11-10 00:08:28,859 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <new_feature_1>cosine<credit_amount><credit_history><credit amount similarity with credit history>
This new feature calculates the cosine similarity between the credit amount and credit history. The idea behind this is that similar credit amounts and credit histories can have a strong correlation with the likelihood of receiving a credit. 

2. <new_feature_2>zscore<credit_amount><unknown><credit amount after unknown value handling>
This new feature applies the z-score normalization to the credit amount feature. This is useful because numerical features in the data are often multi-modal, and z-scoring helps in standardizing the distribution of these features. 

3. <new_feature_3>cross<checking_status><purpose><existing_credit combination>
This new feature combines two categorical features 'checking_status' and 'purpose' to create a new feature. The combination of these two features might indicate certain patterns that are useful for modeling credit approval, like existing credit combinations for certain purposes.

2025-11-10 00:08:34,259 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <>sigmoidsqtratio<num_dependents><status>new feature: sigmoid ratio of dependencies to status
   This feature combines the sigmoid function with the ratio of num_dependents to status. The idea is to capture the non-linear relationship between the number of dependents and the personal status.

2. <>crossğitim<employment><credit_amount>new feature: employment and credit amount interaction
   This feature uses the cross operation to combine employment and credit amount. We might expect a higher credit amount for longer-employment categories, so this interaction can help the model better understand this relationship.

3. <>ltequality<checking_status><credit_history>new feature: equality checking history status
   This feature combines the less than,equality operators to check if the person has an existing credit history. The idea is to capture the relationship between the checking status and credit history, which is important for predicting credit approval.

These three options use different operators and combinations of features to create new features that might improve the downstream model's performance.

1. <checking_status_labels>label_encode<checking_status> - This feature converts the categorical checking_status feature into numerical labels, which may improve the model's ability to understand the relationships between different balance ranges and the likelihood of receiving a credit.
2. <categorical_purposebin<credit_amount> - This feature bins the categorical purpose feature and extracts the count of instances with a purpose category for each bin of the credit_amount feature. This may help the model identify patterns between purpose categories and credit amounts that were previously masked by the categorical nature of purpose.
3. <agebin<duration> - This feature bins the age feature and extracts the count of instances in each age bin for each duration. This may help the model identify patterns between age categories and credit duration that were previously masked by the categorical nature of age and numerical nature of duration.

Note that these are just suggestions and may need to be explored and validated through further analysis and testing. Additionally, the specific operators and combinations may need to be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the project.

2025-11-10 00:08:59,529 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features that can improve the model's performance:

1. checking_status_label_encode<one_hot><checking_status><Label encode the checking status feature to convert categorical values to numerical values>
	* Reasoning: Label encoding is a useful technique to convert categorical values to numerical values, which is a more suitable format for the downstream model. This can help the model learn more robust patterns and relationships. Although the feature engineering problem suggests we left it as categorical, label encoding will allow the model to treat this category differently than it would with one-hot encoding or treating it as the baseline value in that category.
2. duration_bin<bin><duration><Bin the duration feature into larger intervals to reduce noise and capture more general patterns>
	* Reasoning: The existing duration feature has a fairly consistent range, but its distribution might be too fine-grained to capture early signs of delayed payment. By binning it, we can reduce noise and allow the model to focus on more general patterns. For example, we could bin it as [4,12],(12,36],(36,48], and so on. This can help the model to identify meaningful patterns within these larger groupings.
3. credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode<sqrt><credit_amount><savings_status><Square root of credit amount and label encode savings status to capture more nuanced relationships>

* Reasoning: By taking the square root of credit_amount, we can reduce the impact of outliers and highlight more subtle differences in credit amounts that were masked due to outliers. Label encoding of the savings_status column captures the relationships between those categorical features across multiple categories, expected to help further theory around what is feature financially savvy customer.

Next steps will be their evaluations regarding their improvement, although these are just a few of multiple strategies available to generate features.

2025-11-10 00:09:02,976 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. checking_status<bin><total_credit_amount><description: Binned checking status based on credit amount
This step involves binning the checking_status feature based on the credit_amount feature. The reasoning behind this is that the checking_status feature might have different implications for credit worthiness depending on the credit amount. For instance, if the credit amount is high, a lower checking status might be more indicative of credit worthiness than if the credit amount is low. This feature might help the model capture the relationship between checking status and credit amount.

2. credit_amount<log><age><description: Log credit amount scaled by age
This step involves taking the log of the credit_amount feature and scaling it by the age feature. The reasoning behind this is that the impact of credit amount on credit worthiness might decrease with age. For instance, a young person might be more likely to take out a large loan to buy a car, but this might not be as significant a factor in credit worthiness as it would be for an older person. This feature might help the model capture the relationship between credit amount and age.

3. purpose<one_hot><credit_history><description: One-hot encoding of purpose feature based on credit history
This step involves one-hot encoding the purpose feature based on the credit_history feature. The reasoning behind this is that the purpose feature might have different implications for credit worthiness depending on the credit history. For instance, if the credit history is poor, a purpose of 'used car' might be more indicative of credit worthiness than if the credit history is good. This feature might help the model capture the relationship between purpose and credit history.

Note: The descriptions are added for readability, they should be removed in the output.

2025-11-10 00:09:21,025 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operators:

1. Credit Amount by Employment Category

<credit_amount_by_employment><categorical><employment> use categorical encoding for employment categories to create a new feature that represents the average credit amount by employment category.

 reasoning: We can assume that employment status can have an impact on credit worthiness. By encoding the employment categories and multiplying it with the credit amount, we can capture the underlying relationship between employment category and credit amount.

 Feature Engineering Step:  < credit_amount_by_employment > < multiply > <employment > < credit_amount > <new feature that represents the average credit amount by employment category>

2. Credit Amount Smoothing

<credit_amount_smoothed><square><credit_amount> apply square operator to credit amount feature to flatten out the extreme values and reduce skewness in the data.

reasoning: We can use the square operator to reduce the positive skewness in the credit amount feature. This is because the credit amount feature has outliers in the upper tail, which can negatively impact the model's performance.

Feature Engineering Step: < credit_amount_smoothed > < square > < credit_amount > <new feature with smoothed credit amount>

3. Duration by Employment Age

<duration_by_age><groupbythenmean><duration><employment> group the data by employment age and compute the mean duration for each employment age category.

reasoning: We can assume that employment age can have an impact on how long a person has been working with the employer, which in turn can affect the payment history and creditworthiness. By grouping the data by employment age and computing the mean duration, we can capture this underlying relationship.

Feature Engineering Step: < duration_by_age > < groupbythenmean > <duration> <employment> < new feature that represents the average duration by employment category>

Note that these steps assume that there is a relationship between the employment category, credit amount, and/or duration that can potentially improve the downstream model's performance. These steps are just suggestions and should be evaluated using statistical metrics and cross-validation to assess the actual performance improvement.

2025-11-10 00:09:28,167 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <existing_credits>sqrt<credit_amount>Calculate the square root of the credit amount for each client with existing credits, and observe the effect of this new feature on the model's performance.

Reasoning: The sqrt operator can help to reduce the effect of outliers in the credit_amount feature, which can lead to better model performance, especially if the existing credits feature is related to the credit amount in a non-linear way.

2. <checking_status>bin<duration>New feature that indicates the presence of checking status categories in the same bin range as the duration, and introduces a new level of abstraction to model the relationship between checking status and duration.

Reasoning: The bin operator can help to group similar checking status categories together, making it easier for the model to capture the effects of duration on the loan application outcome.

3. <personal_status>one_hot<Foreign_worker>Convert the foreign worker feature into a one-hot encoded categorical feature based on the personal status of the applicant, and creates a new feature that can help to capture the interaction between foreign worker status and personal details.

Reasoning: The one_hot operator can help to create new categorical features that capture the combination of personal status and foreign worker status, which can lead to better model performance, especially if there are certain combinations of these variables that are predictive of the loan outcome.

1. <credit_new_feature_1>equal<duration><savings_status><Whether the duration is greater than the typical duration for the savings_status>
	* Intuitively, people with higher credit amounts are more likely to have higher durations to save the money. This feature can help capture the relation between savings_status and duration.
2. <credit_new_feature_2>log<credit_amount><existing_credits><The logarithm of credit amount considering the number of existing credits>
	* Considering the relationship between existing credits and credit amount, it may be beneficial to create a feature that captures this. Log of credit amount may help to linearize the relationship with existing credits.
3. <credit_new_feature_3>cross<other_parties><personal_status><Whether the credit is given to a person with other parties/script, based on personal status>
	* We should look for interactions between multiple factors that affect the application and approval process for the credit. The presence of other parties can affect the decision to approve the credit, and this can be analyzed by considering its interaction with the applicant's personal status.
