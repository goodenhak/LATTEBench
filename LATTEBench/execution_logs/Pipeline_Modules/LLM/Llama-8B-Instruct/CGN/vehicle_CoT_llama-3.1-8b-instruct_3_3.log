2026-01-28 03:03:45,411 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <ASYMMETRY_NUMERIC>cross<SCATTER_RATIO><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS>Weighted Scatter Ratio by Kurtosis: This new feature combines the SCATTER_RATIO with the KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS to capture the relationship between the scatter ratio and the kurtosis about the minor axis. This could be useful in distinguishing between vehicles with varying degrees of scatter and kurtosis.

2. <COMPACTNESS rectangularity>minmax<PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY>Compactness vs Rectangularity: This new feature normalizes the COMPACTNESS feature to a scale between 0 and 1 and then compares it with the PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY and MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY. This could be useful in distinguishing between vehicles with varying degrees of compactness and rectangularity.

3. <RADIUS_RATIO>log<SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION>Logarithmic Radius Ratio vs Scaled Radius of Gyration: This new feature calculates the logarithm of the RADIUS_RATIO and compares it with the SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION. This could be useful in distinguishing between vehicles with varying degrees of radius ratio and scaled radius of gyration.

These new features are designed to capture different aspects of the vehicle's shape and size, and could potentially improve the performance of the downstream model by providing more information to the model to make predictions.

2026-01-28 03:03:53,184 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Encoding Compressed Features for Compactness Variation:
   <Compactness_var><log><Compactness><new_feature_description: Compactness compressed using logarithm>

   This step applies a log transformation to the Compactness feature, which helps to address the potential non-linearity in the data and compress the large range of values into a smaller range. This can potentially facilitate more precise numerical operations and improve the model's ability to capture the relationships between features.

2. Feature Scaling using Variance Ratio (Squared Variance Along Major Axis) 
   <Scaled_Variance_Along_Major_Axis_ratio><log><Scaled_Variance_Along_Major_Axis><new_feature_description: Scaled variance along MAJOR axis by applying square root>

   This operation involves applying a ratio operation between two features: the Scaled Variance Along Major Axis (SVA along MA) and the Scaled Variance Along Minor Axis (SVA along MI). Then, we apply the log function, which can help in compressing the data distribution that might influence the performance of the model in learning the patterns and improve its generalization capability.

3. Distance-based Feature Combination with DOMINANT Axis features for vehicle analysis 
   <DOMinant_distance_elongatedness><<cross><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><ELONGATEDNESS><new_feature_description: Distance of Dominant moments by adding squared elongatedness along MA>

   Here, we combine the Scaled Variance Along Major Axis (DOMINANT Axis feature: Scaled Variance along MA) with elongatedness measured on that axis using the cross operation. The subsequent extraction of derivatives aligns sets outlines on referred axes differently, effectively building better and relevant features based on suppress principles for understanding vehicle specifics.

2026-01-28 03:03:56,728 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. More information on vehicle type
   <vehicle_type_supported><label_encode><answer>
   This step will create a new feature that represents which vehicle type is supported by the model using label encoding.

2. Vehicle aspect ratio relationships
   <vehicle_aspect_ratio_relationship><ratio><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><new_feature_description>
   This step will create a new feature that represents the relationship between the vehicle's aspect ratio and variance along the minor axis, which can help to differentiate between vehicle types.

3. Statistics of original features
   <meanPR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><rolling_mean><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><new_feature_description>
   This step will create a new feature that represents the mean PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO value over several samples, which can be useful in scenarios where a few outliers have a great impact on the overall performance and we want to smooth out the variation.

These steps will create additional features that will help the model to capture more information about the vehicle, potentially leading to an improvement in the downstream model's performance.

2026-01-28 03:04:06,149 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <Feature_Ratio_PRAXIS_Rectangularity >< minus < PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY >< SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS >< Ratio of PR.AXIS_Rectangularity to SCALED Variance Along Major Axis, indicating vehicle aspect ratio deviance>
2. <Aspect_Ratio_Rectangularity >< log < MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO >< MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY >< log Ratio of Elongatedness to Rectangularity, indicating logarithmic relation between vehicle dimensions>
3. <Feature_Elongatedness_Kurtosis >< cosine < ELONGATEDNESS >< KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS >< Cosine relationship between Elongatedness and Kurtosis, indicating underlying aspect ratio relationships>

Reasoning behind these steps:

* In the first step, we calculate the ratio of PR.AXIS_Rectangularity to SCALED Variance Along Major Axis. This could indicate how the vehicle's aspect ratio deviates from its overall shape, which might be useful for discriminating between different vehicle types.
* In the second step, we use the log operator to transform the MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY features. This could help to reduce the impact of skewness in the distributions of these features and make them more suitable for the downstream model. We also use the log operator to transform the result, which could help to capture the logarithmic relation between elongatedness and rectangularity.
* In the third step, we use the cosine operator to measure the Cosine relationship between ELONGATEDNESS and KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS. This could help to capture non-linear relationships between these features, which might be useful for improving the downstream model's performance.

These are just a few suggestions, and there are many other possible ways to generate new features using the operations provided.

2026-01-28 03:04:12,133 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. OPEL_NONLINEARITY<cube><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY> OPEL NONLINEARITY - Cubing the MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY feature may help to capture non-linear relationships with the target variable.
2. SAAB_KURTOSIS_SQUARE<square><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS> SAAB KURTOSIS SQUARE - Squaring the product of KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS and SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS may capture interactions between these two features and help the model to better distinguish between SAAB vehicles and other types.
3. VAN_PR_AXIS_HOUGH<cosine><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY> VAN PR AXIS HOUGH - Calculating the cosine of the product of PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO and PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY may help to capture geometric relationships between these two features and aid in the classification of VAN vehicles.

The reasoning behind these steps is to capture non-linear relationships, interactions between features, and geometric relationships that may not be captured by the original features. The cube operator can help to capture non-linear relationships, while the product and cosine functions can help to capture interactions and geometric relationships between features. Additionally, label encoding and binning are used to convert categorical variables to numerical variables that can be used in feature engineering operations.

2026-01-28 03:04:16,544 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <FACTOR_RATIO>cross<SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<   This new feature combines the scaled variance along the minor axis and the major axis to capture the essence of the shape's asymmetry. The cross operator allows us to create a new feature that captures the interaction between two features. This feature may be useful for distinguishing between vehicles of different shapes.

2. <SYMMETRY><reciprocal><COMPACTNESS><ELONGATEDNESS<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<    This new feature leverages the compactness and elongatedness features to capture the symmetry property of the shape. A reciprocal operation is applied to the compactness and elongatedness features, which could help reveal the non-linear relationships between these properties and the symmetry of the shape.

3. <ASPECT_RATIO_ALL_AXES><groupbythenmean<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<         This new feature uses the groupbythenmean operator to calculate the mean aspect ratio of all axes for each vehicle class. The MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO, PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO, and SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION features are used as input to the operator, and the resulting mean aspect ratios are concatenated to create a new feature. This feature may help the model distinguish between different vehicle classes based on their overall shape characteristics.

2026-01-28 03:04:21,772 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <PR.GetAxis_Rectangularity>cross<PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO>feature combination of PR.axis rectangularity and max length aspect ratio
This feature combines the PR.axis rectangularity and max length aspect ratio to create a new feature that may be useful for distinguishing between different types of vehicles.

2. <SKEWNESS.Major_axis_exp>exp<SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>transforming skewness about major axis using exponential function
This feature uses the exponential function to transform the skewness about major axis, which may help to alleviate the impact of outliers and non-linear relationships in the data.

3. <GROUPBY.MAX=sum<DATE><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><HOLLOWS_RATIO>total max length aspect ratio summed by each unique date value
This feature uses the groupbythensum operator to sum the max length aspect ratio for each unique date value in the data, which may help to capture trends and patterns in the data that are not immediately apparent from the individual feature values.

Note: The output format is followed as requested. Let me know if you'd like me to explain further or provide additional suggestions.

2026-01-28 03:04:32,913 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features, I would propose the following three next steps to generate new features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <scaled_variance_along_minor_axis>KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS<difference in scaled variance along minor and major axis>A measure of shape asymmetry, which could be useful for distinguishing between different vehicle types
   The reasoning behind this step is that the kurtosis about the major axis is a measure of the distribution's tail weight, and by calculating the difference between the scaled variance along the minor and major axes, we can create a new feature that captures the asymmetry of the distribution. This could be useful for distinguishing between the OPEL, SAAB, BUS, and VAN classes.

2. <max.length aspect ratio>elquota professors PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO<vehicle shape factor related to aspect ratios>A measure of vehicle shape, taking into account both length and axis aspect ratios
   The reasoning behind this step is that by calculating the ratio of the maximum length aspect ratio to the PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO, we can create a new feature that captures the vehicle's shape factor. This could be useful for distinguishing between the vehicle types, as different vehicles may have different shapes.

3. <scaler variance along major axis>scaler variance along minor axis>SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS<shape dispersion vs. skewness ratio>A ratio that compares the dispersion of the vehicle's shape to its skewness
   The reasoning behind this step is that by calculating the ratio of the scaled variance along the major axis to the scaled variance along the minor axis, we can create a new feature that compares the dispersion of the vehicle's shape to its skewness. This could be useful for distinguishing between the vehicle types, as the shape dispersion and skewness may vary across different classes.

These three new features can potentially improve the model's performance by providing additional context about the vehicle's shape and distribution.

2026-01-28 03:04:39,150 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and the performance of the downstream model, I suggest the following three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Extract interaction between aspect ratios and compactness
<>square<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><compssa><new_feature_description: measure of squarness>
This feature assumes that the aspect ratios of the silhouette's length and its perpendicular dimensions are closely related to its compactness. By squaring the length aspect ratio, we may create a feature that is sensitive to deviations from a square shape.

2. Encode categorical features with binary vectors
<>one_hot<PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><new_feature_description: binary encoding of physical parameters>
This feature aims to capture additional information about the relationships between the physical parameters of the silhouette. By using one-hot encoding, we can tap into any relationships between these parameters that may not be apparent from simple arithmetic operations.

3. Investigate the effect of circularity on overall shape
<>ratio<SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><CIRCULARITY><new_feature_description: ratio of scaled variance along major axis to circularity>
This feature aims to capture the relationship between the overall shape of the silhouette (as measured by its sclaeed variance along the major axis) and its circularity. This may reveal insights into how the circular features of the silhouette are influenced by its overall shape.
