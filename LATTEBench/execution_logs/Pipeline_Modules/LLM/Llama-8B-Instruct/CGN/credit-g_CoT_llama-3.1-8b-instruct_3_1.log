2025-11-10 00:04:29,086 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Examine the relationship between credit amount and credit history: Create a new feature that encodes categorical credit history into numerical values, and then calculate the log ratio of the credit amount to the encoded credit history.
   
   <credit_history_encode><numerical_feature><credit_amount> credit_amount_to_credit_history logarithmic ratio

   This feature will help the model understand the complex relationship between credit amount and credit history.

2. Fall off or decay in payment duration: Calculate a feature that measures the decrease in payment duration over time, indicating the impact of long-term credit usage.

   <duration><lag><duration> average decrease in payment duration

   This feature will capture the gradient of credit usage over time.

3. Transform the monthly savings amount to a numerical representation: Use the existing_savings_status and savings_amount to compute a new feature that quantifies meeting savings requirements.

   <savings_status>bins<savings_amount> meeting payments rhe minimum conducting Overall savings life Max penalizer status

   This feature will provide an indication of maintaining adequate savings balances.

These next steps diversify potential feature representations with manipulation modifications, deflections, or identifiable signals without causing congruence.

2025-11-10 00:04:32,194 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Type Conversion for checking_status
checking_status_label_encode<operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
checking_status_label_encode<bin><numerical_feature>checking_status<condition for loan approval is highly dependent on categories of checking_status, labeling them as 0, 1, 2, ... can help in capturing non-linear relationships. By taking the bin of a numerical feature and checking_status, we're generating a new feature that can capture the relationship between the two.

2. capturing interaction between credit_amount and savings_status
savings_status_credit_amount_cross<operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
savings_status_credit_amount_cross<cross><numerical_feature>savings_status<relation between high and low credit_amounts for each savings_status category can be captured by generating new feature with credit_amount and savings_status. This interaction can provide insights into different financial conditions.

3. _categorical_encoding for employment
employment_bin<operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
employment_bin<bin><numerical_feature>employment< encoding employment as 0, 1, 2, ... by taking the bin of a numerical feature and employment can help model learn patterns and relationships between categories.

2025-11-10 00:04:38,885 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <existing_credits_labelencoding>one_hot<existing_credits> 
   This feature aims to capture the distribution of existing credits, which can be useful for imbalanced classes (e.g. many people with no credits).
2. <age>label_encode<savings_status> 
   This feature can help the model distinguish between people with different savings statuses based on their age. It might be useful to see if younger people tend to have different savings statuses.
3. <credit_amount>log<credit_amount> 
   This feature can help the model capture non-linear relationships between the credit amount and itself. The log transformation can reduce the effect of extreme values and make the feature more interpretable.

These steps are chosen based on the following reasoning:

* We want to create features that can help the model capture different patterns and relationships between the existing features.
* The first step aims to capture the distribution of existing credits, which can be useful for imbalanced classes.
* The second step aims to capture non-linear relationships between the credit amount and itself, as well as to create an additional categorical feature that can be used as input for other operators.
* The third step also aims to capture non-linear relationships between the credit amount and itself, and redistribute the importance of its value.

2025-11-10 00:04:48,510 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. one_hot<new_feature_foreign.worker_text><categorical_feature new_feature_foreign.worker_text>: This step uses one-hot encoding on the new_feature_foreign.worker_text feature, which is categorical. One-hot encoding is a common technique used to transform categorical variables into numerical variables, which are easier for the model to understand and can improve the model's performance.

New Feature: new_feature_foreign.worker_text_one_hot

2. label_encode<credit_history><categorical_feature credit_history: This step uses label encoding on the credit_history feature, which is categorical. Label encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical values by replacing them with unique labels.

New Feature: credit_history_label_encode

3. sqrt<age><numerical_feature age>max<age><numerical_feature age>: This step calculates the square root of the age feature and creates a new feature that is the maximum of the original age feature and the square root of age. This new feature can capture the non-linear relationship between age and the target variable.

New Feature: age_sqrt_max

These steps can potentially improve the downstream model's performance by:

* Improving the model's ability to understand categorical variables
* Reducing the dimensionality of the feature space by converting categorical variables into numerical variables
* Capturing non-linear relationships between variables

1. Engage in Categorical Encoding: 
< isNew_Feature>convert<cross>category_purpose><category_employee>: This combines the purpose of the credit and the employment category to create a new feature that might better explain the loan outcome.

2. Generate a Numerical Representation for Categorical Values:
< isNew_Feature=add> <bin><category_savings_status><category_savings_status> Converts the states of the household savings status into quantitative values that could be better used by the model, expecting that the value itself matters and not the category label.

3. Calculate a Custom Risk-Based Median Value for Existing Credits: 
< is_new_Field>rolling_mean<groupbythenmean>existing_credits><category_employment>: This question intends to understand financial risk by calculating a median value of existing credits for subjects who have employed status with 4<=X<7 using a rolling mean over time. This can help understand credit risk as a function of employment status. 

I will keep these features and experiment with further combinations.

2025-11-10 00:04:58,785 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <engaged_in_installment_plans><cross><other_payment_plans><purpose>: This feature combines the information about other installment plans and the purpose of the credit. We can assume that individuals who have existing installment plans (e.g., from banks or stores) and are applying for a new loan for a specific purpose (e.g., a new car) are more likely to be engaged in installment plans for that purpose. This feature could help the model capture the relationship between existing financial commitments and new credit applications.
2. <new_feature_foreign.worker_text><bin><credit_amount>: This feature encodes the categorical variable new_feature_foreign.worker_text into a numerical value using the binning technique. By combining this with the credit amount, we can create a feature that captures the relationship between the individual's financial situation (as described by the foreign worker status) and the credit amount they are applying for. This could help the model understand how different financial situations impact credit decisions.
3. <closing_age_gap><subtract><age><duration>: This feature calculates the difference between the individual's age and the duration of the existing checking account. By subtracting the duration from the age, we can create a feature that captures the time it takes for the individual to close the age gap between the account opening and the loan request. This could help the model understand how age impacts credit decisions and whether there is a relationship between age and loan acceptance.

These features are chosen because they leverage the relationships between existing features, such as the combination of installment plans and purpose, the interaction between financial situation and credit amount, and the time-based relationship between age and duration. These features can provide unique insights that can improve the performance of the downstream model.
