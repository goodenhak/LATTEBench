2026-01-28 02:07:21,032 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. credit_worthiness/<new_feature_name>savecrossmethod/CreditScore/Debt
Created new feature which represents the relationship between credit score and debt. This will help the model to understand how individual's credit score reacts when they have a certain amount of debt.

2. <new_feature_name>type_conversion/Gender/Ethnicity and <new_feature_name>type_conversion/ZriobCode/Citizen
Created new feature by transforming the categorical variables Gender and Ethnicity, and another feature by transforming the categorical variables ZipCode and Citizen. This will help the model to capture non-linear patterns in the data.

3. <new_feature_name>groupbythenmedian/Groupybythenmedian/Industry/Zrieobicode
Created new feature which is the median ZipCode for each unique Industry. This will help the model to understand how individual's ZipCode is distributed across different industries.

These next steps are chosen based on the following reasoning:

- Creditworthiness is a crucial factor in determining an individual's ability to pay off debt. Creating a new feature based on the relationship between credit score and debt can provide valuable insights for the model.
- Categorical variables can often create a multi-dependent feature, especially when there are a lot of levels in the data. Therefore, transforming these variables can help the model better capture non-linear patterns in the data.
- Encouraging model thinking through expert interpretation, groups like industry and people living in the same zip code are likely to have some common characteristics that are relevant to credit decisions and therefore transforming the grouped variables facilitates the modeling process.

2026-01-28 02:07:27,459 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Encoding Ethnicity with Numeric Values: Using label encoding to convert categorical Ethnicity feature into numerical values, which can improve the model's understanding of this feature.
   ethnicy<bin Ethnicity><Income>Why People from Different Ethnic Groups Have Different Income Levels

2. Interaction between Credit Score and Debt: Using the multiply operator to create a new feature that represents the interaction between Credit Score and Debt, which can help the model understand how these two features are related to each other.
   credit_score_debt_int<Multiply CreditScore Debt>How Credit Score and Debt Interact with Each Other

3. Employment Stability: Using the lag operator to create a new feature that represents whether the person has been employed for the same amount of time consecutively, which can help the model understand the person's employment stability.
   emp_stable<Lag Employed>How Long a Person Has Been Employed

These new features can help improve the model's performance by introducing new insights about the data, which can be useful for the downstream task of predicting credit card approval.

2026-01-28 02:07:37,948 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Extracting more information from the categorical features: 
   <YearsEmployed>bin<Age><average_age_bin_description>  
   This step can identify clusters of individuals based on their age and years employed, and create a new feature that captures this relationship, which could be useful for understanding job stability.

2. Using target encoding to capture categorical feature effects: 
   <Industry>target_encoding<Gender><industry_gender_effect_description>  
   Target encoding can be used to capture the relationship between industry and gender, by encoding the industry feature based on the average target (credit application success) for each industry-gender combination.

3. Calculating pairwise relationships between features: 
   <CreditScore>cross<Debt><pairwise_relationship_description>  
   This step can capture the relationship between credit score and debt, which can provide more information about creditworthiness, potentially leading to improved predictions.

2026-01-28 02:07:41,485 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Target Encoding for Industry and Ethnicity
industry_target_encoded<target_encoding><Industry>industry_target_encoded_new feature that uses target encoding to capture the relationship between industry/ethnicity and the target variable.
2. Binary Interaction for Debt and CreditScore
debt_credit_score_interaction<cross><Debt><CreditScore>debt_credit_score_interaction_new feature that captures the interaction between debt and credit score, which may provide insights into creditworthiness.
3. Label Encoding for Citizen
citizen_label_encoded<numerical_feature><Citizen>citizen_label_encoded_new feature that converts the categorical citizen feature into a numerical label, which can be used as a feature by itself or interacted with other features.

The reasoning behind these steps is as follows:

* For the first step, we use target encoding to capture the relationship between industry/ethnicity and the target variable. This can help improve the model's performance by incorporating the underlying distribution of the target variable for each industry/ethnicity group.
* For the second step, we use the cross operator to capture the interaction between debt and credit score. This can provide insights into creditworthiness by considering both the level of debt and credit score.
* For the third step, we use label encoding to convert the categorical citizen feature into a numerical label. This can help the model account for the underlying ordering or structure of the citizen categories.

Let me know if you'd like me to generate more feature ideas or explain the reasoning behind these steps in more detail!

2026-01-28 02:07:48,972 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and the task of predicting successful credit card applications, I'll suggest three possible next steps to generate new features using the operators:

1. Interaction between CreditScore and Debt:
   <credit_score_debt_product><multiply><CreditScore><Debt><New Feature to Represent Creditworthiness>

   The reasoning behind this step is that a person's credit score and debt are strongly related to their creditworthiness. By multiplying these two features together, we create a new feature that captures this interaction, which may help the model better predict successful credit card applications.

2. Label Encoding Industry and Ethnicity with Gender:
   <industry_gender><label_encode><Industry><Gender><New Feature to Represent Industry-Ethnicity-Gender Interactions>
   <ethnicity_gender><label_encode><Ethnicity><Gender><New Feature to Represent Ethnicity-Gender Interactions>

   The reasoning behind this step is that the industry and ethnicity of an individual may have different implications on credit card application success depending on their gender. By label encoding these features with gender, we create new features that capture these interactions, which may help the model better account for these complex relationships.

3. Interactions between Income, Age, and Years Employed:
   <age_income_product><multiply><Age><Next line of code with layer interactions><Income><new feature describing economic maturity and financial stability>
   <years_employed_income_product><multiply><YearsEmployed><Income><new feature describing job stability and financial stability>
   <years_employed_age_product><multiply><YearsEmployed><Age><new feature describing job stability and age>

   The reasoning behind this step is that income, age, and years employed are all related to a person's financial stability and economic maturity. By creating new features that represent the interaction between these variables, we provide the model with more detailed information about each applicant's financial situation and background.

Note: I used angle brackets (<>) to separate the new feature name, operator, and parameters as instructed.

2026-01-28 02:07:54,857 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations:

1. years_employed_employed_product_advanced<cross<years_employed_employed_product<Employed>
This feature combines the years employed and employed status to create a cross product, which can help capture the interaction between the two variables. This can be useful for the model as it may highlight the impact of employment status on job stability.

2. Employed<categorical><Industry>
This feature transforms the categorical industry variable into a numerical vector using label encoding, which can be useful for the model as it can create a more numerical representation of the categorical variable.

3. CreditScore<sigmoid><CreditScore>Probability of Default
This feature applies the sigmoid function to the credit score, which can help the model to better understand the probability of default from the credit score. The sigmoid function maps any real number to a value in the interval [0, 1], making it suitable for binary classification problems like creditworthiness.

Each of these features addresses the potential impact of either feature interaction, categorical to numerical transformation, or application of mathematical functions to augment information in the dataset.

2026-01-28 02:08:01,341 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and the goal of predicting credit card success, I would suggest the following three possible next steps to generate additional features that may improve the performance of the downstream model:

1. One_hot<Industry><CreditScore> Credit Score by Industry: This feature combines the categorical Industry and numerical CreditScore features to create a new feature that captures the variability in credit scores across different industries. This can help the model account for the specific credit score distribution in each industry.

2. bin<Ethnicity><CreditScore> Credit Score by Ethnicity: This feature combines the categorical Ethnicity and numerical CreditScore features to create a new feature that captures the variability in credit scores across different ethnic groups. This can help the model account for the specific credit score distribution in each ethnic group.

3. rank<years_employed_age_product><Employed> Job Stability Ranking: This feature creates a new feature that ranks the years_employed_age_product feature, which combines job stability and age, based on whether the individual is employed or not. This can help the model account for the different levels of job stability experienced by employed and unemployed individuals.

The reasoning behind these steps is to create features that capture the relationships between different aspects of an individual's financial history, creditworthiness, and demographic information, which may be useful for predicting credit card success.

2026-01-28 02:08:07,851 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and their descriptions, here are three possible next steps to generate features that can improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Encode Ethnicity as numerical feature in CreditScore ratio: The ethnicity of a person can have a significant impact on their credit score. We can convert the categorical ethnicity feature into a numerical feature based on the credit score of individuals in each ethnicity group. This will allow the model to learn the relationship between ethnicity and credit score more effectively.

credit_score EthnicityRatio <numerical_feature> <label_encode> Ethnicity <numerical_feature> CreditScore

2. Use prior default as a weight in the calculation of years employed age product: Prior default can indicate a person's credit risk. By incorporating prior default as a weight in the calculation of years employed age product, we can capture the impact of credit risk on job stability and age, which is encoded in the years employed age product feature.

years_employed_age_product Weighted <numerical_feature> square PriorDefault <numerical_feature> years_employed_age_product

3. Create a binary feature indicating if years employed income product exceeds a certain threshold: This feature can help the model identify individuals with a high years employed income product, which can be a strong indicator of financial stability.

years_employed_income_product ExceedsThreshold <categorical_feature> bin <numerical_feature> years_employed_income_product

These features can capture additional relationships between the predictors and target variable, and can potentially improve the model's performance. Note that these steps are just suggestions, and the effectiveness of the features generated will depend on the specific problem and dataset.
