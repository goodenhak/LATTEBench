2026-01-28 03:00:29,365 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and their descriptions, I will suggest three possible next steps to generate additional features using the given operators. The goal is to create features that would be useful for a downstream classification task.

1. Features incorporating asymmetry of shape:
   - <ASYM_METRIC>diff<SCATTER_RATIO><ELONGATEDNESS><features =>
   Description: Create a new feature that captures the increase in SCATTER_RATIO while the shape is elongated. This would be useful for models that try to predict long and narrow shapes.

2. Introduced based on correlations between shape features:
   - <CORR_FEATURE>cross<COMPACTNESS><DISTANCE_CIRCULARITY><based on given correlations between features
   Description: Analyze the correlations between COMPACTNESS and DISTANCE_CIRCULARITY and create a new feature that represents the positive or negative interaction between the two. This could lead to a stronger model by creating a measure of overall shape quality.

3. Switching between aspect ratios and rectangularities:
   - <BOTH пересект میتوانCRYPT<PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO?><PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY><based on analysis of aspect ratios and rectangularities.
   Description: Analyze both the aspect ratios and rectangularities of a vehicle-based shape by including it as one feature, disregarding their traditional separation. This feature would provide a more comprehensive view of a vehicle's silhouette. First, combine aspect ratios by making them processed features like zscore or quantile normalization.

More approaches are based on computational strategies, exploration and analysis of proportion of particular important shape concepts.
Further Approaches are:
a) Grouping First indexes Biases: The api provides a constrained technique across target variable with distinct mask representations or target representation definitions that need monetarily complex preprocessing.

   <DOM_CHAIN 亚 feature><max><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS> Here, we take the max of the absolute difference between the order of SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS and SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS, leading to a feature that helps us interpret what shape features tell us about the orientation of features which could tell us a lot about vehicles.


3. Figuring out leading Indicators of Shape:
   <LEAD_ASPECT_RATIO><diff><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS> By finding the difference between PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO and SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS, we get a gauge of whether the vehicle's major axis respects (a ) an elongated shape while taking into account the vehicle's dimensional mean to recognize common structure features to render a decision from the vehicle silhouette.


Note: VAN_flag is a pre-existing categorical feature in the Data Examples sections in the original prompt

2026-01-28 03:00:40,277 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. Extracting Interaction Effects
	<>ratio<feature1:COMPACTNESS,feature2:RADIUS_RATIO>COMPACTNESS-RADIUS_RATIO interacting effect describing the relationship between compactness and radius ratio.
2. Standardizing Distribution
	<>zscore<feature1:SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS,feature2:SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS>standardizing scaled variance along major and minor axis.
3. Combining Predictive Power
	<>cross<feature1:PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO,feature2:SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>combining axis aspect ratio and skewness to potentially improve classification performance.

I chose these steps for the following reasons:

1. Interaction Effects: The COMPACTNESS and RADIUS_RATIO features may interact with each other in a non-linear way, and extracting this interaction effect could provide valuable insights for the downstream model.
2. Standardizing Distribution: Standardizing features helps to reduce the effect of scale and distribution on the model, which can improve its robustness and generalization performance.
3. Combining Predictive Power: Combining features can help to capture complex relationships and improve the predictive power of the model. In this case, combining axis aspect ratio and skewness may help to improve the classification performance.

2026-01-28 03:00:43,967 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <radius_ratio>cube<max.length_aspect_ratio></cubic_max_length_ratio>Feature_1: cubic value of radius ratio, Feature 2: Max Length Aspect Ratio, This feature can capture the non-linear relationship between radius ratio and max length aspect ratio, which can be useful for the downstream model.

   Here, we are using the cube operator on the radius ratio feature, which can help to capture the non-linear relationships between features. We are then combining this feature with the max length aspect ratio feature using the cross operator. This can help to create a feature that is sensitive to the interaction between the two input features.

2. <scatter_ratio></sqrt><scaled_variance_along_major_axis></sqrt_difference>Feature_1: Squared Scatter Ratio, Feature 2: Scaled Variance Along Major Axis, This feature can capture the difference between scatter ratio and scaled variance along major axis, which can be a useful indicator of the vehicle's shape and size.

   Here, we are simply taking the square root of the scatter ratio feature. This can help to reduce the multi-modality and outliers in the scatter ratio feature. We are then comparing this feature with the scaled variance along major axis feature using the equal operator, which can help to create a feature that captures the difference between the two input features.

3. <elongatedness></cross><pr.axis_aspect_ratio><max.length_aspect_ratio></elongateness_ratio>Feature_1: Elongatedness, Feature 2: Max Length Aspect Ratio and PR Axis Aspect Ratio, This feature can capture the elongation of the vehicle, which can be useful for identifying different types of vehicles.

   Here, we are using the cross operator to combine the elongatedness feature with the max length aspect ratio and PR axis aspect ratio features. This can help to create a feature that captures the interactions between the elongatedness of the vehicle and its aspect ratios. The resulting feature can be useful for identifying different types of vehicles, including those that are elongated or compact.

1. <RADIUS_RATIO_ASC><minmax><RADIUS_RATIO><RADIUS_RATIO><Euclidean Radius of the silhouette>'
   This operation calculates the z-score of RADIUS_RATIO, which can help us understand the extent to which each silhouette's RADIUS_RATIO value deviates from the mean.

2026-01-28 03:00:56,899 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

2. Augmenting features with label encoding

3. Combining features for aspect ratio analysis
	* <MAX_LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO_RECTENGULARITYрутienratio>cross<MAX_LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><PR_AXIS_RECTANGULARITY>The combined feature for aspect ratio and rectangularity analysis

Here's the reasoning behind each step:

1. By taking the cube of the product of compactness and circularity, we create a new feature that captures higher-order interactions between these two features. This can help the model learn more complex patterns in the data.
2. Label encoding is a technique for handling ordinal values in categorical features. By label encoding the PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO feature, we can capture the ordering in the values (e.g., 48, 57, 65) and provide the model with a more nuanced understanding of the data.
3. By combining the MAX_LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and PR_AXIS_RECTANGULARITY features using the cross operator, we create a new feature that captures the relationship between these two aspects of the data. This can help the model learn more abstract patterns in the data and improve its performance.

2026-01-28 03:01:08,007 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Ratio of different features
HOLLOWS_RATIO_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS<ratio><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS>Ratio of scaled variance along major and minor axes to understand how they interact with hollows

This feature might be useful in capturing the relationship between the variance of a shape and its hollows. By taking the ratio of these two features, we can create a new feature that might be more relevant to the classification task.

2. Interaction between aspect ratios
MAX_LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO_PR_Axis_Gradient<cross><PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX_LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO>Interaction between major and minor axis aspect ratios, capturing the gradient of elongation

This feature combines the maximum length aspect ratio with the major axis aspect ratio, which might capture the interaction between how elongated a shape is and how its major axis is aligned. This could be an informative feature for a classification model.

3. Non-linear transformation of critical features
ELONGATEDNESS_SQUARED_CROSS_DETERMINANT<_square><ELONGATEDNESS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS>Non-linear transformation of elongatedness and scaled variance of major axis, capturing non-linear relationships between critical features

This feature takes the square of the elongatedness and the cross-determinant of elongatedness and scaled variance of the major axis. The square operation can help to amplify the effect of elongatedness, while the cross-determinant can capture the interaction between two critical features in a non-linear way. This feature might be useful in highlighting the importance of elongatedness and major axis variance in the classification task.

Note that these suggestions aim to create new features that are relevant to the classification task by combining, transforming, or interacting existing features.

1. <NEW เมษายน COMPACTNESS.loggedIn Combo> zscore COMPACTNESS PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO A z-score feature representing the combination of compactness and aspect ratio.
2. <SECTION SCHMIT Source Ratio> sine ELONGATEDNESS SCATTER_RATIO A new feature that represents the sine of the ratio of elongatedness to scatter ratio.
3. <SAHOliver Flatness ed shaped KUrtosis About Minor Axencostcutwit type(nr, manual_y_ popular> minmax HOLLOWS_RATIO KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS S KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS ratio adjusted by scaling.

I made this choice because:
 
1- The business outcome of interest is to predict the vehicle type, and we want to give more weight to the combination of compactness and aspect ratio. Therefore, we generate a new feature that combines both of these features, which might help the model distinguish between different types of vehicles.
2- The vehicles are viewed from many angles, and taking the sine of the ratio between elongatedness and scatter ratio might allow us to symmetrically the features per all angles. It might help the model capture variations of vehicle shapes across all views.
3- We add some non-linearity to the relationship between variabilities of a vehicle, by multiplying HOLLOWSRATIO with KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS, which might capture the aspects of vehicle that isn’t obvious when take the statistics about these two variable alone.

2026-01-28 03:01:38,852 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <MuchElongatedVehicle>difference<SCATTER_RATIO><ELONGATEDNESS>Mathematical comparison indicating vehicle elongation exceeding threshold at multiple silhouettes angles
	* Operator: diff
	* Features: SCATTER_RATIO, ELONGATEDNESS
	* Reasoning: This feature will help us capture the difference in elongation qualities between different angles of a vehicle. This can be relevant in distinguishing elongated vehicles that may appear different under various angles.
2. <ASYKURTOSIS>target_encoding<SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><HOLLOWS_RATIO>Category assigned to the vehicle based on ratio indicating kurtosis anti-correlation
	* Operator: target_encoding
	* Features: SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS, HOLLOWS_RATIO
	* Reasoning: This feature will help us model correlations between observed shapes in silhouettes (anti-kurtosis) using a language the model can understand - categories.
3. <GapPrRatio exceedingcommonalthre apparently sharply inclined angles<greater<RADIUS_RATIO><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO>Feature describing vehicles that widen across multiple views given shape quintessence ratio surpassing pr.axis
	* Operator: greater
	* Features: RADIUS_RATIO, PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO
	* Reasoning: This feature will help identify silhouettes whose compactness decreases at different view angles as the RADIUS_RATIO at pr.axis surpasses its mean, creating distinctions between vehicle shapes and view angles viewed for categorization.
