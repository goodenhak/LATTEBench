2026-01-28 02:33:01,967 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. <>square<loc><v><Square of the LOC vs Cyclomatic complexity>
2. <>label_encode<loc><v(g)><LOC Label ENCODED by cyclomatic COMPLEXITY>
3. <>groupbythenrank<loc>vcompressroup<LOC BASED on CYCLOMATIC RANK>

Reasoning behind the steps:

1. In this step, we are squaring the LOC (Line of Code) against the Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)). This new feature can help the model to capture the interaction between these two features, which may indicate the complexity of the code and the difficulty in maintaining it. The squared term can also emphasize any non-linear relationships that may exist between the two features.
2. In this step, we are applying label encoding on the LOC feature based on the Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)). This can help the model to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between these two features, particularly when the model is used in downstream tasks that require these features. Label encoding maps the categorical feature (Cyclomatic complexity) into a numerical feature, which can be used in the model.
3. In this step, we are grouping the data by LOC and then ranking the Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) for each group. This new feature can help the model to capture the relationship between the LOC and the Cyclomatic complexity across different groups of similar code sizes, which can be useful in identifying patterns and outliers in the data.

2026-01-28 02:33:08,845 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. IntellectualQuality<>square<e><v>(A measure of intellectual quality, calculated by squaring the effort value).
2. cyclomaticComplexity<>concat<uniq_Op><loc>(A measure of cyclomatic complexity, calculated by concatenating the unique operators and line count).
3. NoneGodelg<>bin<b><e>(A categorization of none godel elements by binning the effort value).

Explanation:

1. The first step, IntellectualQuality, aims to increase the feature density with a new variable that represents the growth and non-linear change of the effort required for a module. Squaring the effort value should amplify its effect on the downstream model, making it easier for it to detect patterns and improve prediction performance.

2. The second step, cyclomaticComplexity, seeks to integrate two fundamental MCCBBS metrics: cyclomatic complexity and code length. The goal is to provide a holistic representation of the code complexity, increasing the dataset's expressiveness and making it more amenable to predictive modeling.

3. In the third step, NoneGodelg attempts to categorize modules using a BDD or non-functional requirement that has no Godel elements (no loops). This is equivalent to assuming that a small number or absence of effort is due to none implementation of specific patterns. Therefore, by binning the effort value, the downstream model will gain the ability to comprehend this constraint better and also trust the categorical signal more effectively.

2026-01-28 02:33:22,866 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. < defects_score><target_encoding><unique_Op>encode defects score based on unique operators
This feature combines the target variable (defects score) with the unique operators feature to create a new categorical encoding for each possible combination. This can help the model learn non-linear relationships between the target and the unique operators feature.

2. <halstead_diff><diff><e><v>calculate difference in Halstead effort and volume
This feature calculates the difference between the Halstead effort and volume features, which can help the model learn about the balance between these two metrics.

3. <cyclomatic_composition><cross><v(g)>><v(if)>calculate the cross-product of cyclomatic complexity and if-construct volume
This feature combines the cyclomatic complexity and if-construct volume features using the cross operator, which can help the model learn about the interplay between these two metrics.

These steps are chosen based on the following reasoning:

* The target_encoding operator is used to create a new categorical encoding for the unique operators feature, which can help the model learn non-linear relationships between the target and this feature.
* The diff operator is used to calculate the difference between two features (Halstead effort and volume), which can help the model learn about the balance between these two metrics.
* The cross operator is used to combine two features (cyclomatic complexity and if-construct volume), which can help the model learn about the interplay between these two metrics.

2026-01-28 02:33:59,265 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and operators, here are three possible next steps to generate features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <logical_negation><v><ev(g)><new_feature_description>

Using the logical negation operator (negate) on the v feature (Halstead 'volume') and ev(g) feature (McCabe 'essential complexity'), we can create a new feature that captures the difference between these two complexities. This could potentially help the model distinguish between modules with varying levels of complexity.

2. <cross><u_widgets_location><b><new_feature_description>

By crossing the uniqueness of widgets in a module (u_widgets_location) with the Halstead 'operator count' (b), we can capture the relationship between the number of operators and the diversity of widgets in a module. This could provide valuable information about module quality.

3. <rolling_mean><total_Op><branchCount><new_feature_description>

Applying the rolling mean operator to the total operators (total_Op) feature and the branch count (branchCount) feature, we can create a new feature that captures the average number of operators and branches over a window of values. This could help the model smooth out noise in these features and identify patterns in module behavior.

These next steps aim to create new features that capture additional aspects of module quality, such as complexity, operator count, and widget diversity. By incorporating these new features, the downstream model may be able to make more accurate predictions about software defect presence.

2026-01-28 02:34:05,781 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the given operators:

1. <test_label>target_encoding loc locCodeAndComment is used as a feature to categorize the model's complexity, so encoding it into numerical values could help improve the model's understanding of the relationship between the code's complexity and its likelihood of having a defect.
 squat target_encoding locCodeAndComment,categories=[0, 1] label encoding of locCodeAndComment to create a binary target feature that captures model performance
2. <ev_feature>sqrt e e is a measure of Halstead's effort, taking the square root of e might help reduce the impact of extreme values on the model.
 square e reduces the influence of extreme values in e and helps capture its non-linear relationships with other features
3. <complexity_diff>minus uniq_Op,v(g) this features calculates the difference between uniq_Op and v(g), which might help the model understand the interplay between Halstead's volume and McCabe's cyclomatic complexity.
 minus uniq_Op,v(g) relates two different complexity measures to understand how they relate to each other in the presence and absence of defects

2026-01-28 02:34:24,647 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. Encoding Halstead metrics

2. Counting code complexity features
	* <complexity_count>cumsum<loc,v(iv(g),ev(g))><Count of increasing complexity features, which may indicate code refactoring needs>
3. Calculating pairwise relationships
	* <operator_count>cross<uniq_Op, total_Op><Count of unique operators and total operators, which may indicate coding patterns>

And two more:

4. Identifying outliers in Halstead metrics
	* <Halstead_zscore>zscore<e><Identify modules with unusual effort metrics, which may indicate coding anomalies>
5. Rolling average of code complexity
	* <rolling_complexity>rolling_mean<loc, v(iv(g),ev(g))><Rolling average of complexity features over a time window, which may smooth out noise>

Note that these suggestions are based on the assumption that the downstream model is a classification model, and the goal is to generate features that capture relevant patterns in the data. The reasoning behind each step is to:

* Encode categorical variables (Halstead metrics)
* Count increasing complexity features (indicating code refactoring needs)
* Calculate pairwise relationships between variables (operator and operand counts)
* Identify outliers in Halstead metrics (indicating coding anomalies)
* Smooth out noise in complexity features using rolling averages

These features can be explored and validated using techniques such as recursive feature elimination, correlation analysis, and permutation importance to determine their impact on the downstream model's performance.

2026-01-28 02:34:31,679 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Extracting Interaction Terms

2. Encoding McCabe's Metrics

3. Transforming Halstead's Volume
	* <v_label_encode_thresh>0.5</v><label_encode><v><Halstead's volume encoded as a categorical feature with a threshold of 0.5, potentially capturing its non-linear effects on software quality>

These steps aim to:

* Extract interaction terms between features using element-wise production (elem_prod), which can help capture complex relationships between variables.
* Encode McCabe's metrics (cyclomatic complexity, design complexity, and essential complexity) as categorical features, allowing the model to better capture their effects on software quality.
* Transform Halstead's volume using label encoding, which can help the model better capture its non-linear effects on software quality.

By incorporating these new features, the downstream model may be able to better capture the complex relationships between the inputs and the target variable, ultimately leading to improved performance.
