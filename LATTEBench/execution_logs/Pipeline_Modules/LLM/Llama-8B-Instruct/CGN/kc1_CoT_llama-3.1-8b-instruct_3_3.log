2026-01-28 02:23:51,202 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <distance mamaname>bin<ev(g)>Gives the bin of the McCabe essential complexity measure ev(g), which may help the model understand the structural complexity of the code.

The reasoning behind this step is that binning can help reduce the dimensionality of the data and make it easier to find patterns. By converting the McCabe essential complexity measure into a categorical variable, the model can potentially learn to recognize relationships between these bins and the presence of defects.

2. <label_encode>v>UniOpnda^2 Gives a new feature that uses the label encoding of the McCabe essential complexity measure v and the total number of unique operands uniq_Opnd, squared. This new feature might help the model in predicting the spatial complexity of the code.

The reasoning behind this step is that using the label encoding of a feature can help in distinguishing between different classes of values. Combining this with the squared total number of unique operands can give insights into how the complexity of the code might relate to the number of unique operands.

3. <distancevide>groupbythenstd[loc,t> This new feature calculates the standard deviation of the loc and t features grouped by the branching count. This can provide information on how code length and development time are distributed among different branching structures.

The reasoning behind this step is that standard deviation can reveal information about the variance of these features among different branching structures. A high standard deviation might indicate inconsistent or poorly designed branching.

2026-01-28 02:25:21,186 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Feature Engineering to Highlight Complexity Patterns
sql
<complexity_ratio>cross<loc><locCodeAndComment>new feature highlights modules with high complexity and fewer comments or blank lines.

This feature Engineering highlights the modules with high complexity and fewer comments or blank lines that may lead to difficulty in maintaining the code. Cross-multiplication of the loc feature with the locCodeAndComment feature will provide a new feature that captures this relationship, potentially useful for the downstream model.

2. Extracting Trends from Changing Metrics
sql
<trend_score>rolling_mean<e><e.Mockgroupbythenmean>d(change in effort over time). Description: a trend score for effort over time.

Applying rolling mean to the effort metric e grouped by the d feature will help to analyze change patterns over time. The downstream model may benefit from capturing these trends as they can indicate better code quality or poorly developed features.

3. Highlighting Problematic Operators and Operands
sql
<operand_ratio>label_encode<uniq_Op><uniq_Opnd>new feature spot\ operator and operand frequency.

Label encoding the uniq_Op and uniq_Opnd features can highlight problematic operators (those with higher frequencies among unique classes in operators). The ratio between the two encodings can then reveal if factors overload dominates (high uniq_operands appear with high freq), balance the limits in a code set with enough unique operators. This could potentially help defect prediction for downstream performance improvement.

1. Feature interaction - Essential Complexity and Volume:
	* <essential_complexity_interaction><cross><ev(g)><v>>
	* Create a feature that represents the interaction between McCabe's essential complexity and Halstead's volume, which could capture the relationship between code structure and volume.
2. Feature transformation - Effective Parameters:
	* <effective_parameters><zscore><(n*i)/e>>
	* This feature transforms the combination of Halstead's effort (e) and the ratio of Halstead's program length (i) and effort (n), and normalizes it using z-score, capturing the relationship between code complexity and development effort.
3. Feature extraction - Branch Count and Desired Result:
	* <branch_count_relationship><lag><branchCount><desired_result>>
	* This feature lags the branch count by one step and calculates the relationship between the previous branch count and the desired result, capturing the sequential relationship between code complexity and development outcome.

2026-01-28 02:25:32,087 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <unique_op_count_average>square<uniq_Op><time><unique_operators averaged over time>
   - Reasoning: Understanding the average number of unique operators over time may provide insights into whether the complexity of code is changing over time. The sine and cosine operators are good for encoding periodic changes, but here we are interested in the overall variability, hence square operation.

2. <comment_to_code_ratio>bin<LocCodeAndComment><lOC><representing the ratio of comments to code lines>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of comments to code lines can indicate the quality and maintainability of code. Higher ratios often indicate that comments are being used to explain complex parts of the code.

3. <branch_count_to_total_op><cross><branch_count><total_operators> Representing proportion of branches to operators in the code, or how many of every operations constitute a branching point.>
   - Reasoning: Understanding how branches compare to total operations can help in estimating the code's flow and its maintainability. The proportion of every operation constituting a branching point might give us a better understanding of code performance.

2026-01-28 02:25:35,561 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. Feature Interaction: Halstead Difficulty and Essential Complexity
	<> cube <> difficulty <> iv(g) <features interaction has been proven to be beneficial in software defect prediction>
2. Feature Transformation: Halstead Volume and Loc
	<> reciprocal <> v <> loc <reverse the effect of Halstead volume, which might improve model's predictions>
3. Groupbythen: Feature Clustering by McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead's Program Length
	<> groupbythenmedian <> vg <> l <grouping similar data points and applying the median might improve model's robustness to outliers>

These steps aim to:

* Explore feature interactions that might be relevant for software defect prediction.
* Examine feature transformations that could improve model performance.
* Apply a groupbythen operator to group similar data points and apply a summary statistic, which might improve model robustness.

Here are three possible next steps to generate new features to improve the performance of the downstream model:

1. v_bin<v(g)<v 
This feature binning is used to categorize McCabe's cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) into three categories (low, medium, high).

2. e_log<numsqrt> < e 
This feature converts Halstead effort (e) into binary logarithm to improve its distribution and possibly make it easier for the model to learn.

3. e_groupbythenmean<program_classentifier>a(groupbythenmean(l, loc, target='defective') 
This feature applies groupbythenmean to the average program length (l) by program class and target (defective or not defective), creating new feature that could help to capture the difference in program length between different classes or defective and non-defective programs.

2026-01-28 02:26:24,417 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided data and features, here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the given operations, with the goal of improving the downstream model's performance:

1. Interaction between Halstead metrics and Cyclomatic complexity:
   <>
   cross
   n
   ev(g)
   Interaction between Halstead's metrics like 'n' (total operators+operands) and McCabe's Cyclomatic complexity 'ev(g)' can help the model understand the association between these two metrics, potentially leading to better predictions.
   
2. New feature derived from lOCode and lOComment:
   <>
   concat
   lOCode
   lOComment
   This new feature combines the number of lines of code and comments, providing a better understanding of the code's readability and maintainability aspects.
   
3. Relationship between BranchCount and Halstead's time estimator:
   <>
   min
   branchCount
   t
   Here, we're looking at the least significant relationship between the number of branches and Halstead's time estimator. This can help in identifying modules with higher complexity, which might be harder to maintain or modify.

2026-01-28 02:26:31,951 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operators:

1. Create a new feature that combines McCabe and Halstead metrics

<age_fourier_feature><cosine><ev(g)><iv(g)> <Combine McCabe and Halstead metrics using cosine similarity>

Reasoning: This feature combines the age_fourier_feature with two essential Halstead metrics, ev(g) and iv(g), using cosine similarity. This might help capture the complexity and design aspects of the code.

2. Transform categorical features into numerical features

<loc><label_encode><branchCount> <Convert McCabe's line count into a categorical feature using label encoding>

Reasoning: This feature converts the categorical feature branchCount into a numerical feature using label encoding, which might help the model learn the frequency and distribution of branchCounts.

3. Create a new feature that extracts time-related information

<loc><excer latent><lOCode><lOComment> <Extract time-related information from code metrics>

Reasoning: This feature combines loc, koje, and lOComment into a new feature using reverse-exponential operator, which might help extract time-related information from the code, considering both code lines and comments.

4. Create a new feature that combines multiple Halstead metrics

<ev(g)>><cross><iv(g)><d> <Combine Halstead metrics using cross-product operator>

Reasoning: This feature combines the essential complexity metric (ev(g)) with the design complexity metric (iv(g)) and difficulty metric (d) using the cross-product operator, which might help the model learn the relationships between these metrics.

These are just a few potential next steps, and there are many other possible feature engineering possibilities. The goal is to create new features that capture meaningful relationships between the existing features and improve the performance of the downstream model.

2026-01-28 02:26:51,888 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <age_fourier_feature><cosine><age_fourier_feature><loc><new_feature_description: Cosine similarity between age_fourier_feature and loc> 
   This step calculates the cosine similarity between the age_fourier_feature and loc, which may help capture non-linear relationships between these two features.

2. <loc><label_encode><branchCount><new_feature_description: Label encoded branchCount based on loc> 
   This step label encodes the branchCount feature based on the loc feature, which may help the model capture non-linear relationships between these two features.

3. <v(g)><cross><ev(g)> <iv(g)> <new_feature_description: Interaction between v(g) and ev(g) and iv(g)> 
   This step calculates the interaction between v(g), ev(g), and iv(g) using the cross operator, which may help capture complex relationships between these features.

These steps are chosen based on the following reasoning:

* The first step uses the cosine operator to calculate the similarity between age_fourier_feature and loc, which may help capture non-linear relationships between these two features. This is a good idea because age_fourier_feature is a complex feature that may not be easily interpretable, and loc is a simple feature that may be related to the complexity of the code.
* The second step uses the label_encode operator to encode the branchCount feature based on the loc feature. This is a good idea because branchCount is a categorical feature that may not be easily interpretable, and loc is a numerical feature that may be related to the complexity of the code.
* The third step uses the cross operator to calculate the interaction between v(g), ev(g), and iv(g). This is a good idea because these three features are all related to the complexity of the code, and calculating their interaction may help capture complex relationships between them.
