2026-01-28 03:06:09,667 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided dataset and features, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Combined Circularity and Compactness : 
<COMBINED_CIRCULARITY_COMPACTNESS> cube COMPACTNESS CIRCULARITY Compute the cube of the product of Compactness and Circularity to explore the relationship between these two features.

2. Aspect Ratio and Skewness Relationship : 
<ASPECT_RATIO_SKEWNESS_CORRELATION> cosine PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS Calculate the cosine similarity between the Aspect Ratio and Skewness of Major Axis features to analyze their correlation.

3. Hollows Ratio and Compactness Exponentiation Difference : 
<HOLLOW_RATIO_COMPACTNESS_RATE_OF_CHANGE> diff CIRCULARITY COMPACTNESS sqrt( HOLLOWS_RATIO ) Calculate the difference of the exponentiation of Compactness and Circularity features, and then multiply the Hollows Ratio feature to identify the rate of change in these features.

Reasoning:

- The first step explores the relationship between Compactness and Circularity by computing their cube product. This can help identify whether silhouettes with higher compactness and circularity tend to belong to specific vehicle types.
- The second step captures the correlation between Aspect Ratio and Skewness of Major Axis. This can help the model understand whether vehicles with certain aspect ratios tend to have specific skewness values.
- The third step analyzes the interaction between Hollows Ratio and the exponentiation of Compactness and Circularity. By examining these relationships, the model might learn that certain vehicles have distinct rates of change in their compactness, circularity, and hollows ratios.

2026-01-28 03:06:26,907 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations:

1. Extracting Inter-Feature Relationships

<new_feature_name> correlation<cross>MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO<MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY> new_feature_description: correlation between max length aspect ratio and max length rectangularity

This feature captures the relationship between the shape of the vehicle and its length. By extracting the correlation, we can gain insight into how the two features interact with each other, which may be useful for the classification task.

2. Hierarchical Feature Generation

<new_feature_name> rank<feature>MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO < feature>MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO> new_feature_description: rank of max length aspect ratio compared to max length rectangularity

This feature generates a new value that represents the ranking of the max length aspect ratio compared to the max length rectangularity. This can help the model understand the relative importance of these two features.

3. Feature Scaling and Encoding

<new_feature_name> zscore<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO>MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO<new_feature_description: scaled max length aspect ratio>

This feature standardizes the max length aspect ratio by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This can help the model to better understand the distribution of this feature and make it easier to compare with other features.

Each of these steps aims to extract new information from the existing features or to transform the existing features in a way that may be more useful for the downstream model.

2026-01-28 03:06:43,688 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Analyzing Aspect Ratios 
    <ASPECT_RATIO_DIFF><diff><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><Difference between MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO>
    This feature aims to capture the difference between the aspect ratios of the vehicle's length and its major and minor axes, potentially providing insight into the vehicle's shape and orientation.
2. Hollows and Compactness 
    <HOLLOW_TO_COMPACT><ratio><HOLLOWS_RATIO><COMPACTNESS><Ratio of HOLLOWS_RATIO to COMPACTNESS>
    This feature seeks to relate the vehicle's hollow areas to its compactness, potentially indicating the vehicle's structural properties and how they relate to its classification.
3. Aspect Ratios and Rectangularity 
    <ASPECT_TO_RECT><cosine><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY><Cosine similarity between MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY>
    This feature explores the relationship between the vehicle's length aspect ratio and its rectangularity, potentially providing a more nuanced understanding of the vehicle's shape and how it relates to its classification.

Each of these features uses a different operator and combination of existing features to generate a new feature that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance by providing more information about the vehicle's shape, structure, and classification.

2026-01-28 03:06:47,017 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and operators, here are three possible next steps to generate features that can improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <car_type_encode><one_hot><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><Answer><An encoded feature for car type which can help model distinguish between different types of vehicles>
	* This step uses label encoding to convert the Answer feature (categorical) into a numerical feature, which can then be used to create a new feature set using one-hot encoding.
2. <HOLLOWS_RATIO><diff><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY><A feature that captures the change in hollow ratio with respect to shape ratio>
	* This step calculates the difference between the HOLLOWS_RATIO and the MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY features, which can help the model capture the interaction between these features and improve its ability to distinguish between different types of vehicles.
3. <lambda groupbythenmean<Answer>><square><COMPACTNESS><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><A feature that captures the compactness of a vehicle relative to its size>
	* This step uses the groupbythenmean operator to group the data by the Answer feature (categorical) and calculate the mean compactness for each group. The resulting feature is then squared to give more weight to vehicles with higher compactness.

These steps prioritize creating new features that capture complex relationships between existing features, and use label encoding, one-hot encoding, and groupbythenmean to achieve this.

2. <PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY '..', bin<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO>: This feature uses binning to bucket MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO into groups, and then calculates the PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY for each bin. This can help the model learn the relationships between rectangularity and aspect ratio for different classes of vehicles.
3. <HOLLOWS_RATIO>, min,HOLLOWS_RATIO<MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY>: This feature uses the minimum interaction to find the smallest relationship between HOLLOWS_RATIO and MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY, which can provide useful information about the relationships between these two features.

These features are created by applying different transformation and interaction operators to the existing features, which can help the model learn more complex relationships and improve its performance.

1. >square<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO>Squared Length Aspect Ratio
2. <MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><compare>0>Multi-Class
3. <MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><abs><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS> Absolute Kurtosis Aspect Ratio

The reasoning behind these steps:

Step 1: Squaring MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO may introduce non-linearity and increase the capacity of the model to learn more complex relationships between this feature and the target variable. The resulting squared value can help the model to capture quadratic relationships that might not be apparent from the original feature.

Step 2: Comparing MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO to 0 can create a binary feature that indicates whether a vehicle's length aspect ratio is greater than or less than 0. This can be useful for capturing the presence of vehicles with unusual or extreme shape, which might not be modeled effectively by the original features.

Step 3: Taking the absolute value of KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS can help to stabilize the feature by removing the effect of extreme values, which can be useful for model robustness and fairness. In addition, this feature can help to capture the overall shape of the vehicle, independent of the orientation or angle of view.

2026-01-28 03:07:07,966 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. MASK2_COSINE_MAX_LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO_MAX_LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY: cosine >MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO< * MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY< * rectangularity of certain car types can be hexagonal or oval, cosine distance can help distinguish between them
2. PRAXISASPECTRATIOLOG_KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS: log >PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO< * KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS< * conveying more information on axis deviation and complexity, log scale can highlight potential non-normal distribution
3. HOLLOWS_RATIO_BIN_COMPACTNESS: bin >HOLLOWS_RATIO< >COMPACTNESS< * may reveal different compactness levels for different hollow ratios, i.e., many small holes or few large holes

Reasoning:

* In step 1, I'm generating a feature that combines the compactness of the vehicle (represented by MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO) with the rectangularity of its silhouette (represented by MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY). The cosine operator is used to measure the similarity between these two features. This can help the model identify whether the vehicle's compactness and rectangularity are related or not, and potentially improve the classification accuracy.
* In step 2, I'm using the log operator to scale the PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO feature. The log function can help reveal potential non-normal distributions in the data, which can be beneficial for downstream classification tasks. The relationship between the axis aspect ratio and kurtosis about the major axis can provide additional information about the vehicle's shape and complexity.
* In step 3, I'm binning the HOLLOWS_RATIO feature and comparing it with the COMPACTNESS feature. This can help identify different compactness levels for different hollow ratios, which can be useful for distinguishing between vehicle types. This feature may reveal interaction between hollowness and compactness that the model can learn upon.

1. Create a feature that combines the numerical aspects of MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and COMPACTNESS with a give-me-more-information factor:

 MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO_ATAN жовтня COMPACTNESS<tan>MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO<FORM>COMPACTNESS>this feature takes the arctan of the product of MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and COMPACTNESS. It is useful because the arctan function ensures the values in the feature will range only form 0 to p/4 instead of 0 to infinity.

2. Create a feature that extracts the coefficient of variation of KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS and HOLLOWS_RATIO across  multiple angle of view:

 GROUPBYthenmean<KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>HOLLOWS_RATIO<this feature creates the interquartile range and the mean, then divides the interquartile range by the mean.

2026-01-28 03:07:50,677 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. <TWOSIDE_RATIO>cosine<PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO>PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY>cosine similarity between aspect ratios of major and minor axis
Intuition behind this step: Vehicles have different proportions of their major and minor axes. By calculating the cosine similarity between these aspect ratios, we can capture the relationship between the two axes, which may be useful for distinguishing between different vehicles. This is a simple yet powerful way to transform the data.

2. <CUBE_VOLUME>cube<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO>COMPACTNESS>volume of vehicle projection onto major axis
Intuition behind this step: The cube volume represents the 3D volume of the vehicle's projection onto the major axis. By incorporating this feature with the max length aspect ratio and compactness, we can capture the relationship between the vehicle's size, shape, and projection onto the major axis. This is another simple yet effective way to transform the data.

3. <PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO>groupbythen<groupby_P answered then=min>COMPACTNESS>minimum compactness of vehicles with similar major axis proportions
Intuition behind this step: By grouping the data by the PR AXIS ASPECT RATIO, we can analyze the relationship between the major axis proportion and compactness. This allows us to identify the minimum compactness of vehicles with similar proportions, which may be characteristic of certain types of vehicles.
