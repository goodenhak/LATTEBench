2026-01-28 02:54:16,238 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided data, here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. NssssC_rank<label_encode><NssssC><NssssC>NssssC rank
   This step involves using the rank operator to rank the number of atoms of type ssssC (NssssC) and then encoding it as a categorical feature. This can help the model understand the relative importance of NssssC values in the dataset.

2. SpMax_L_zscore<zscore><SpMax_L><SpMax_L>Standardized SpMax_L
   This step involves standardizing the SpMax_L feature using the z-score transformation, which can help the model understand the Normal distribution of SpMax_L values.

3. C%_bin<bin><C%><C%>C% binarized
   This step involves binarizing the percentage of C atoms (C%) feature into a new categorical feature. This can help the model understand the binary distribution of C% values in the dataset.

These three steps generate new features that can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model by providing additional information about the dataset.

2026-01-28 02:54:24,260 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <f3 enc><categorical_feature nHDon><new categorical bin feature from nHDon> - This operator uses the label_encode operation on the numerical feature nHDon to bin it into categories, creating a new categorical feature that can be used in machine learning models.
2. <cross><numerical_feature nCb-><categorical_feature nArNO2><new numerical feature from interaction between nCb- and nArNO2> - This operator uses the cross operation to create a new numerical feature by taking the interaction between the numerical feature nCb- and the categorical feature nArNO2. This allows the model to learn the relationship between these two features.
3. <groupbythenmean f4 mean><categorical_feature nHDon><numerical_feature LOC><new numerical grouped mean feature> - This operator uses the groupbythenmean operation with nHDon as the grouping key and LOC as the feature to calculate the mean value of across different groups of nHDon. This creates a new numerical feature that captures the average value of LOC for each category of nHDon.

Note that these operations are based on my understanding of the provided data and the available operators, and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the downstream model.

2026-01-28 02:54:40,712 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. New Feature: Biodegradability Indicator
<BIODEG_INDICATOR>label_encode<nO><categorical_feature)nO (Biodegradability indicator based on the number of oxygen atoms)
This feature is a simple transformation of the number of oxygen atoms (nO) into a categorical variable, where the presence or absence of oxygen atoms can serve as a rough indicator of biodegradability.

2. New Feature: Chemical Complexity
<CHEM_COMPLEXITY>sqrt<SpMax_L><SpMax_A> (Chemical complexity based on the leading eigenvalues from Laplace and adjacency matrices)
This feature combines the leading eigenvalues from two different matrices (SpMax_L and SpMax_A) using the square root operator. This may help capture the complexity of the chemical structure in a more comprehensive way.

3. New Feature: Halogen Content Ratio
<HALOGEN_RATIO>ratio<nX><nO> (Halogen content ratio based on the number of halogen and oxygen atoms)
This feature calculates the ratio of halogen atoms (nX) to oxygen atoms (nO). This may be useful in understanding the role of halogens in influencing biodegradability.

Note that these are just three possible next steps, and there are many other feature engineering approaches that could be explored to improve the model's performance.

2026-01-28 02:54:46,983 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the operators:

1. ratio>nX>nHM>Ratio of No. of halogen atoms to No. of heavy atoms This operation involves calculating the ratio of the number of halogen atoms to the number of heavy atoms, which could provide insights into the chemical composition of the molecules. The use of ratio operator will help to normalize these two variables and detect potential relationships between them.

2. <numerical_feature>SpMax_L>label_encode>C%> conversion of SpMax_L to categorical based on percentage of C atoms This operation involves converting the SpMax_L into categorical using the percentage of C atoms. This will allow for deviation in the data to be recorded. This feature will represent the strength of molecular characteristics from a topological perspective.

3. <categorical_feature>bin>SM6_L> binary encoding of SM6_L based on bin range (binary encoding > 9 is 1, otherwise 0) This operation involves converting the Spectral moment of order 6 from Burden matrix weighted by mass feature into binary using a bin range of 9. This can help to encode categorical information without losing dimensionality.

2026-01-28 02:56:29,105 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 3391, 'completion_tokens': 322, 'total_tokens': 3713}
2026-01-28 02:56:29,105 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. <activity_level>target_encoding churches><classvariable_nX<calculate the activity level for each chemical class and encode it as a numerical value for downstream use 

   Reasoning: This feature combines the concepts of target encoding in a specific feature (churches) and calculates a weighted sum of the target (activity level) as a new numerical feature for each class. This can help control overfitting and allow the model to learn a more nuanced relationship between the classes and the activity level.

2. <halogen_load>cosine<Me<lambda_index><calculate the cosine similarity between the halogen load and two numerical features lambda_index and mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me)

   Reasoning: By incorporating the halogen load as a feature that is calculated by taking the cosine of the angle between three other features, this operation calculates the similarity between these features and the halogen load. This operation combines the concepts of cosine similarity and helps model the relationship between the halogen and other molecular descriptors.

3. <degree_connectivity>concat<categorical_feature_NO><categorical_feature_TOP><generate a new feature that combines categorical variables NO and TOP through a concatenation

   Reasoning: This operation generates a new feature by combining another categorical feature. Often with chemical data where certain molecular descriptors follow specific variable relationships, some values appear more frequently in certain combinations of the provided features.

These feature engineering approaches help control overfitting and improve the relationship learned by the model between the molecular descriptors and the target variable.

2026-01-28 02:56:36,992 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Create a new feature that represents the ratio of Nitrogen-containing groups to Halogen atoms

nN_X_ratio<ratio>nN<nX>

This feature can capture the balance between Nitrogen-containing groups and Halogen atoms, which may be informative for classification. The ratio operator will calculate the ratio of nN to nX, allowing us to analyze their relationship.

2. Create a new feature that represents the binary encoded version of Halogen atom presence

nX_bin<type_conversion>categorical_feature:nX<bin>nX>

This feature can help to capture the effect of Halogen atoms on the classification. By encoding nX as a binary variable, we can analyze the presence or absence of Halogen atoms independently.

3. Create a new feature that represents the correlation between F03[C-O] and SdssC

F03_C_O_Sdss_C_corr<cross>F03[C-O]<SdssC>

This feature can capture the relationship between the Frequency of C - O at topological distance 3 (F03[C-O]) and the Sum of dssC E-states (SdssC), which may be informative for classification. The cross operator will calculate the correlation between F03[C-O] and SdssC, allowing us to analyze their relationship.

These three features can be used to improve the performance of the downstream model. The first feature can capture the balance between Nitrogen-containing groups and Halogen atoms, the second feature can help to capture the effect of Halogen atoms, and the third feature can capture the relationship between F03[C-O] and SdssC.

2026-01-28 02:57:02,886 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the dataset and the features provided, I'll suggest three possible next steps to generate features using the operations. My goal is to improve the downstream model's performance.

Step 1: Transformations and interactions
To capture non-linear relationships between features, I'll use the cosine, square, and reciprocal operators.

1. <Psi_i_A_square><square><Psi_i_A><captures_non_linearity_in_psi_i_a>
2. <F02[C-N]_cosine><cosine><F02[C-N]><F03[C-O]><captures_non_linearity_in_f02_c_n_and_f03_c_o_interaction>
3. <F04[C-N]_reciprocal><reciprocal><F04[C-N]><minimizes_the_impact_of_f04_c_n_on_model_performance>

Step 2: Encoding and interaction
To capture the categorical nature of some features, I'll use the label_encode and bin operators.

1. <NssssC_label_encode><label_encode><NssssC><binary_encoding_of_NssssC_for_model_feasibility>
2. <nArNO2_bin><bin><nArNO2><numerical_representations_of_nArNO2_for_model_interpretability>
3. <B04[C-Br]_bin><bin><B04[C-Br]><numeric_transform_of_B04[C-Br]_for_model_viability>

Step 3: Grouping and summarization
To capture the overall trend and variation of features within groups, I'll use the groupbythenmean and groupbythenstd operators.

1. <nHM_groupbythenmean><groupbythenmean><nHM><LOC><captures_group_level_trends_in_nHM_and_LOC>
2. <nX_groupbythenstd><groupbythenstd><nX><nHM><captures_group_level_variances_in_nX_and_nHM>
3. <F01[N-N]_groupbythenmean><groupbythenmean><F01[N-N]><nCp><isolates_F01[N-N]_trends_and_nCp>

These next steps can potentially improve the downstream model's performance by:

* Capturing non-linear relationships between features (Step 1)
* Encoding and interacting with categorical features (Step 2)
* Identifying group-level trends and variances (Step 3)

2026-01-28 02:57:06,649 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Calculate the ratio of Nitrogen atoms to number of ring tertiary C(sp3) atoms. This could highlight the importance of nitrogen-based rings.

<tNtot_RnoCrt><ratio><nN><nCrt>< Ratio of Nitrogen atoms to number of ring tertiary C(sp3) atoms>

2. Use locator index (LOC) to encode the presence of halogen atoms. This could capture the relationship between the molecular topology and the presence of halogen atoms.

LOC_label_encode_<nX><LOC><label_encode><nX>< Encoding LOC values for the presence of halogen atoms>

3. Calculate the sliding average of the logarithm of the molecular weight atom. This could smooth out the atom weights and provide a more stable feature.

log_mean_tau_<nX><log><nX><log>< One sliding average of the logarithm of the molecular weight atom (tau=2)

These operations leverage the potential of available features, taking into account the type of features used and the downstream model performance.

2026-01-28 02:57:16,153 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided data and features, here are three possible next steps to generate new features that may improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <psi_change-mean>sqrt<NSSSC><feature calculated by finding the difference in Psi_i_A between two consecutive instances, and then taking the square root of NssssC (number of atoms of type ssssC)>
This new feature, psi_change-mean, could help capture the change in the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index (Psi_i_A) over time, which might be related to the structural changes of the molecules. Taking the square root of NssssC could help to reduce the impact of extreme values and provide more insight into the relationship between the change in Psi_i_A and the number of specific atomic structures.

2. <c هجirate_f04-cosine><numerical_feature>Encoded_F03[C-O]><feature> Encodes the categorical feature F03[C-O] as a set of numerical features and then takes the cosine of the difference between the encoded F04[C-N] and the encoded F03[C-O]>
This feature combines the concept of encoding categorical features (label_encode) with the idea of capturing relationships between different molecular descriptors (cosine). This could provide a new way to analyze how the frequency of C-N and C-O structural patterns interact with each other.

3. <lmzf04_max>groupbythenmaxlambda_index<DClasses><feature>Groups the data by the Classes (0 or 1) and then calculates the maximum lambda_index for each group, followed by taking the difference between the maximum lambda_index for the two classes)>
This feature takes advantage of the fact that the model is trying to predict the readiness of chemicals to be biodegradable. By comparing the maximum lambda_index for each class, this feature aims to highlight the difference in lambda_index between the two classes, which could be an important indicator of the readiness of a chemical to be biodegradable.
