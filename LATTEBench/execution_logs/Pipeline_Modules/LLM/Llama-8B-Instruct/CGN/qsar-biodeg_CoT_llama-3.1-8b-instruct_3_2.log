2026-01-28 02:38:56,186 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

Step 1: Interaction feature with label encoding
The interaction between molecular descriptors and categorical features might provide valuable insights. We will use the label_encode operator to transform the target variable and then calculate the modulus operator between the transformed label and a molecular descriptor.

<new_feature_name> Lorncrt <label_encode> <target_variable> <mod> <cross>-<C%> <nCrt><new_feature_description> Interaction between logarithmic version of ring tertiary C(sp3) and categorical label encoded target variable

Step 2: Transformed feature using log and sine
Applying logarithmic and sine transformations to some molecular descriptors might reveal useful relationships. We will calculate the sine operator using two molecular descriptors with dissimilar ranges and a log operator to find relationships in the ranges of transformed values.

<new_feature_name> LsinSpMax_A <log> <SpMax_A> <sin> cross- F03[C-N] <new_feature_description> Sine of logarithmic value of the leading eigenvalue 

Step 3: Meta-feature using rolling mean and groupbythen operations
Previous operations couldn't immediately derive the relationship between feature values and the target variable. We will create a meta-feature using the rolling mean over various molecular descriptors across the dataset. We will see if there is a correlation between the rolling mean values of these features and the target variable after groupbythen operations.

2026-01-28 02:39:04,063 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. Interaction between Me and F04[C-N]: Create a new feature that captures the interaction between atomic electronegativity and frequency of C-N bonds.

Feature Engineering Step: <interaction-mei-f04cn> cross <Me> <F04[C-N]> <Capture interaction between atomic electronegativity and C-N bond frequency>

Reasoning: The atomic electronegativity (Me) and frequency of C-N bonds (F04[C-N]) may influence each other, and their interaction could provide valuable information for the downstream model.

2. Ranking C% using SpMax_L: Create a new feature that ranks the percentage of C atoms (C%) based on the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L).

Feature Engineering Step: <c-ranking> rank <SpMax_L><C%> <Rank C% based on SpMax_L>

Reasoning: The leading eigenvalue (SpMax_L) may indicate the molecular structure's complexity, and ranking C% by this complexity measure could help the downstream model understand the relationship between C% and biodegradability.

3. Encoded type of atoms: Create a binary feature that indicates the presence or absence of certain types of atoms based on the number of atoms (e.g., N-O).

Feature Engineering Step: <no-type-encoding> bin <NUM_nO> <Encode presence/absence of N-O atoms>

Reasoning: The downstream model might benefit from explicit information about the types of atoms present in the molecule. By encoding the number of N-O atoms as a binary feature, we provide the model with clear and interpretable information about the molecule's composition.

3. <J_Dz(e)>log<NssssC>log_j_dze_nssssc> The log transformation can help reduce the effect of outliers in J_Dz(e) and NssssC. Taking the log of these features can help the model learn more robust relationships between them and the target variable. This feature can help the model distinguish between molecules with high and low J_Dz(e) and NssssC values.

2026-01-28 02:39:48,683 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <new_SpMax_Bm_Greater_JDze><greater><SpMax_B(m)>J_Dz(e)> This feature calculates the difference between the leading eigenvalue from Burden matrix weighted by mass and the Balaban-like index from Barysz matrix weighted by Sanderson electronegativity. The reasoning behind this step is that both features are related to the molecular structure and topology, and their difference may capture additional information that can help improve the model's performance.

2. <new_SpMax_L_Squared_C><square><SpMax_L><C%>> This feature calculates the square of the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix and multiplies it by the percentage of C atoms. The reasoning behind this step is that the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix is a topological descriptor that captures the molecular connectivity, and squaring it may amplify its effect. Multiplying it by the percentage of C atoms can help capture the relationship between the molecular structure and the presence of C atoms.

3. <new_SdssC_Diff_SdO><diff><SdssC><SdO>> This feature calculates the difference between the sum of dssC E-states and the sum of dO E-states. The reasoning behind this step is that both features are related to the molecular electronic structure, and their difference may capture additional information that can help improve the model's performance. The difference between these two features can help identify molecules with unique electronic properties.

These three features are designed to capture different aspects of the molecular structure and properties, and their addition may help improve the downstream model's performance.

1. <SpMax_L_changes><difference><SpMax_L><SpMax_B(m)> - Measure the change in SpMax_L over time by subtracting the previous value of SpMax_B(m) from the current value. This could be a useful feature to capture the rate of change in molecular structure.
2. <oxygen_to_halogen_ratio><ratio><SdO><nX><new_feature_description> - Calculate the ratio of oxygen to halogen atoms, which could be an interesting feature to explore in the context of biodegradability.
3. <electronegativity_variation><absolute><Me><J_Dz(e)> - Calculate the absolute difference between the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity and the Balaban-like index from Barysz matrix weighted by Sanderson electronegativity. This could help capture the variation in electronegativity across different atoms in the molecule.

These next steps aim to:

* Capture temporal dynamics in molecular structure
* Explore the relationship between different molecular properties
* Highlight the variation in atomic electronegativity

2026-01-28 02:40:04,866 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. Combine [SpMax_L, J_Dz(e)] using sum of squares: This could help capture the combined effect of molecular structure and electronegativity on the biodegradability of a chemical. The sum of squares is a common technique to combine multiple features.

<SpMax_L_sum_of_squares>J_Dz(e)<SpMax_L>Combined Molecular Structure and Electronegativity

2. Label encode [C%] and use it as a categorical feature: This could help the model learn the non-linear relationships between the percentage of carbon atoms and biodegradability. By converting a numerical feature to categorical, we can inject non-linearity into the model.

<C>C%%%%%%%%<C%><Categorical Carbon Percentage>

3. Group by [SpMax_B(m), SM6_B(m)] using median: This could help the model learn the group-wise relationships between the molecular descriptors and biodegradability. By taking the median, we can identify the middle value of each group and learn the relationships between the groups.

<GroupMedian>?+error홤at?<Median>?+error洪?<SpMax_B(m)><SM6_B(m)>
               <median_Molecular_Descriptors>

Note: The operators used are explained in the format you provided, with no spaces or \ between the operator and the features. Also, the operators used are sine, label_encode, and cross, which are not used in the previous instructions, but are relevant for feature engineering in the context of the instructions.

2026-01-28 02:40:11,548 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. _<square><SpMax_L><SpMax_B(m)>Square of quotient of SpMax_L and SpMax_B(m) This operation calculates the square of the ratio between SpMax_L and SpMax_B(m), which may reveal non-linear relationships between these two features. The use of the square operation can help to amplify the effect of the ratio and make it more meaningful for the model.

2._<label_encode><C%><class Franti18 Fifth axis project-ready’>Convert the C% feature into a binary encoding, with 1 indicating that the chemical is ready for biodegradation and 0 otherwise, based on the class Franti18 Fifth axis project-ready.

3._<cross><Me><nO><Interaction between Me and nO> Create an interaction term between Me and nO, which may capture the effect of oxygen atoms on the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity. This can help the model to better understand the complex relationships between these two features.

These operations are chosen based on the following reasoning:

* The first operation aims to capture non-linear relationships between two features, which may improve the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data.
* The second operation converts a numerical feature into a categorical one, which can help the model to better understand the classification problem and improve its accuracy.
* The third operation creates an interaction term between two features, which can help the model to capture the effect of one feature on the other, and improve its ability to make accurate predictions.

2026-01-28 02:40:18,757 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. Interaction between SpMax_L and C%
<SpMax_L_cross_C%><cross><SpMax_L><C%><Interactions between molecular structure and percentage of C atoms>

This step aims to capture the relationships between the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) and the percentage of C atoms (C%) in the chemicals. By interacting these two features, we might discover new patterns that can help the downstream model classify biodegradability.

2. Normalization of Me using the mean of SpMax_L
<Me_mean><minmax><Me><SpMax_L><Normalization of electronegativity feature using SpMax_L>

This step tries to normalize the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me) using the mean of the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L). This can help alleviate the effect of the skewed distribution of SpMax_L on Me and improve the model's performance.

3. Identifying outliers in SpMax_B(m) and SdssC
<SpMax_B_m_bin_SdssC><bin><SpMax_B(m)><SdssC><Identification of outliers in Burden matrix and SdssC feature>

This step uses the bin operator to identify outliers in the leading eigenvalue from the Burden matrix weighted by mass (SpMax_B(m)) and the Sum of dssC E-states (SdssC). By categorizing these features into binary labels (0 or 1), we can highlight chemical structures that exhibit unusual patterns, potentially improving the model's performance.

2026-01-28 02:40:24,738 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. Interact between molecular structure and percentage of C atoms
<SpMax_L_cross_C%><cross><SpMax_L><C%> Generates a new feature that captures the interaction between the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix and the percentage of C atoms. This can help the model understand the relationship between these two features and improve its performance.

2. Transform Z-score of SdO into a categorical feature
<SdO><zscore><SdO><bin><SdO> Computes the z-score of the sum of dO E-states and bins it into a categorical feature. This can help the model capture the distribution of SdO and reduce the impact of outliers.

3. Use target encoding to transform N-073 into a numerical feature
<N-073><target_encoding><ccategorical_range_N-073><N-073> Uses target encoding to transform the categorical feature N-073 into a numerical feature. The categorical_range_N-073 parameter should be specified to define the set of possible values for N-073.

These steps aim to improve the performance of the downstream model by:

* Interacting between molecular structure and percentage of C atoms to capture complex relationships between features.
* Transforming SdO into a categorical feature to reduce the impact of outliers and improve model robustness.
* Using target encoding to transform a categorical feature into a numerical feature to provide additional information to the model.
