2026-01-28 10:11:48,894 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features generated in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to improve the downstream model's performance:

{loc lempo (explained below) label_encode, v(g) v(g) sqrt, e halved (explained below)}

Here's a breakdown of the new features:

1. loc lempo label_encode: This feature uses the loc metric as a numerical feature and applies a label encoding transformation to it. We use this encoding to convert the numerical feature to a categorical feature, which may help the model capture non-linear relationships between loc and the target variable.
2. v(g) v(g) sqrt: This feature calculates the square root of the v(g) (cyclomatic complexity) metric. Taking the square root may help reduce the effects of extreme values and provide a more stable feature for the model.
3. e halved label_encode: This feature halves the value of the e (effort) metric, then applies a label encoding transformation. Halving e may help reduce the effects of outliers and non-linear relationships with the target variable, and the label encoding may further improve the model's ability to capture interactions between e and the target variable.

And here's a brief explanation for the feature names:

- lempo: diff(n, loc) - This feature captures the difference between the Halstead volume (n) and loc, which may indicate how effective the code is in achieving its intended purpose while taking up a certain amount of space.

- h: e / 2, Half the Effort Feature  - This feature reduces the effort metric to half, which can help to capture non-linear relationships with other features.

Please let me know if you want to add or modify features.
