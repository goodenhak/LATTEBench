2026-01-28 10:04:55,590 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.

Please note that I assumed you were referring to categorical features (Industry and Citizen) to create new features. In RPN, you can't directly multiply or divide categorical features.
