1. Age and CreditScore cross: to see if those who have the combination of young and excellent credit history have higher chances of credit card acceptance.
f6 f20 cross

2. YearsEmployed and Employed cross: to check if having a long employment period and being currently employed will boost credit card acceptance chances.
f7 f12 cross

3. Debt Income interaction: to check if those with a higher income tend to have smaller debt numbers
f3 f20 multiply
