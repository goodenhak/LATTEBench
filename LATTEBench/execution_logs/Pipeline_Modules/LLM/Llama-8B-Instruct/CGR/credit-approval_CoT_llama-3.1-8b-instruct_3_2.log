The new features are:
- zipcodemin represents the minimum value in a bin ( zip code is divided into 8 bins), 
  I used Q1 (25%) - zip_code to get the lower_bound of bin, and zip_code to get the upper_bound, thus {} zipper decode equal is used to determine in which bin zip_code falls. 
- yearsemployed exp represents the category to which years employed belongs in the scale 100-1100. 
  And yearsemployed exp 500 is to get the category to which years employed belongs in the scale 0-500, 
  zipcodemin 160 is the minimum value in that bin for zip_code, and zipcodemin 160 zipper decode equal is checking if zip_code belongs to that category.

2026-01-28 10:02:16,759 - INFO - LLM Output: {f1 f6 cross, f2 f7 sigmoid, f4 min f5 lag 3}

Explanation:

* f1 f6 cross: This new feature calculates the cross product of the binary features Gender and Married. This is because lending decisions often consider the relationship between having a partner and gender.

* f2 f7 sigmoid: This new feature calculates the sigmoid of the absolute value of Age times CreditScore. The sigmoid function is often used for binary classification problems, and we are using it here to transform the product of these two features, which are both numerical and correlated with the target variable.

* f4 min f5 lag 3: This new feature calculates the minimum value of the Debt feature and the Debt feature shifted three lags (previous values) to the left. This is a way to capture the transient effect of debt in the current period, especially for the cases where the target variable is 1.

This new set of features should improve the performance of the model by capturing new and distinct relationships between the existing features.

{Debt sqrt, PriorDefault Ethnicity_Latino cross, Income sqrt}.
Your new features are:
1. sqrt(PriorDefault)
2. (Employed * YearsEmployed)
3. tanh(Income + CreditScore)
4. sqrt(Debt)
5. PriorDefault * Ethnicity_Latino and
6. Income to get the square root of it
