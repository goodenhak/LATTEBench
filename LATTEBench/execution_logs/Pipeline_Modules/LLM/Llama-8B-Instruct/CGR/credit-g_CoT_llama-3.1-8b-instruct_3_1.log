This RPN expression creates three new features:

1. sqrt duration credit_amount plus: calculates the square root of the sum of the duration and credit amount features.
2. credit_amount 5 bin: bins the credit amount feature into 5 categories.
3. age numerical_duration age diff: calculates the difference between the age feature and the rotated duration feature, which may help capture non-linear relationships between these two features and the target variable.

2025-11-09 23:49:01,275 - INFO - LLM Output: {f2 credit_amount multiply, f1 duration until 24 greater, f1 credit_amount divide f3 credit_history label_encode 5 bin}

Explanation:

1. f2 credit_amount multiply creates a new feature that is the product of credit_amount and duration.
2. f1 duration until 24 greater creates a new feature that is 1 if duration is greater than 24, and 0 otherwise. This can be useful because the data suggests that longer duration values are more likely to be associated with credit values of 1.
3. f1 credit_amount divide f3 credit_history label_encode 5 bin creates a new feature that is the result of dividing credit_amount by the index of the category in credit_history after label encoding it with 5 bins. This can help capture non-linear relationships between credit_amount and credit_history.
