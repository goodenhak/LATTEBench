Here are three new features generated based on the provided operators and features. 

1. The first new feature is the result of squaring the sum of credit_amount and duration_credit_amount_plus_numerical_feature_5_bin: f1 f2 plus sqrt.
2. The second new feature is the square root of the sum of credit_amount and credit_amount_square: f1 f4 plus natural_log. 
3. The third new feature is the natural logarithm of the result of the natural logarithm of the numerical value of own_telephone from label encoding of <0 (yes): f1 yes 5 bin cross.
