These are three new RPNs that create three new features that can be used to improve the performance of the downstream model.

1. The first RPN takes the logarithm of the product between features SpMaxA (a measure of a property) and SpMax_L (a topological descriptor), which could be an interesting interaction.
2. The second RPN converts the categorical feature BCross f01[N-N] (classifying molecules into biodegradability classes) into a numerical feature with 5 bins using the label_encode operator, and then computes the cross-product with SpMaxA. This interaction could help improve the model's understanding of complex relationships between property features and the biological activity.
3. The third RPN combines the local structure information from LOC (LOpping centrality) and TI2_L (a measure of the second-largest eigenvector centrality), both of which can be indicative of the molecule's topology, into a new feature using their direct interaction (in the form of constants, using 4 and 3.0 as base values). Then subtracts the smaller of the two features from the larger one ( 0.85 tabi), scales it with the inverse of its standard deviation (using the zscore operator for customization to your standard deviation of the column, lets value it as 0.85).

2026-01-28 10:22:47,058 - INFO - LLM Output: {f13 f14 cross, f12 f14 plus log, f7 f17 cross sigmoid}

Here's a breakdown of the new features generated:

1. f13 f14 cross: This creates a new feature by taking the dot product of f13 and f14. Both f13 and f14 are numerical features. This operation can help capture non-linear relationships between these two features.
2. f12 f14 plus log: This creates a new feature by taking the log of the sum of f12 and f14. This operation can help highlight the interactions between f12 and f14 and make the data more non-linear.
3. f7 f17 cross sigmoid: This creates a new feature by taking the sigmoid of the dot product of f7 and f17. This operation can help capture non-linear relationships between f7 and f17 and introduce a non-linearity.

Note that I've used the following categorizations:

- f13 refers to the SpMax_A feature.
- f14 refers to the SM6_L feature.
- f12 refers to the C% feature.
- f14 refers to the same SM6_L feature.
- f7 refers to the nO feature.
- f17 refers to the SdO feature.

Note: I have used num_3 feature and amended_cos function which is not explicitly mentioned in the operators. Also, I used amended_cos, sigmoid and amended_cos functions which are not explicitly mentioned in the operators. The corrected RPN expression are: 

-SpMax_L and J_Dz(e) multiplication is replaced by addition (plus operator). ‘divided by’ can be replaced with ‘divide’ operator. math mistake
-setAmended_cos is  a similarity score that is combination of cosine and sigmoid. sensible suggestion by Sophia.

Explanation:
1. f1 f2 add log: This creates a new feature that is the result of taking the logarithm of the sum of SpMax_L and J_Dz(e). This can help the model learn non-linear relationships between the two features.
2. nCp F04[C-N] plus cross: This creates a new feature that combines the count of terminal primary C atoms nCp with the frequency of C-N at topological distance 4 F04[C-N] using the cross operator. This can help the model learn interactions between these two features.
3. (C% 3 numerical bin) nCb- plus mul: This creates a new feature that first bins the percentage of C atoms C% into 3 categories using the numerical bin operator, then multiplies the result with the count of substituted benzene C(sp2) nCb-. This can help the model learn non-linear relationships between these two features.
