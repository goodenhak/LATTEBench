2025-11-09 23:56:33,960 - INFO - LLM Output: {credit_amount duration plus bin, credit_amount job label_encode, credit_amount residence_since cross duration}

Explanation:
1. credit_amount duration plus bin: Creating a new numerical feature by adding credit_amount and duration, and then binning the result into, for example, 5 bins. This can help capture the interaction between the two variables.

2. credit_amount job label_encode: Convert the job categorical feature into a numerical format using label encoding. This can help the model understand the different job types more effectively.

3. credit_amount residence_since cross duration: Creating a new categorical feature by crossing credit_amount with residence_since and duration. This can help capture the impact of different credit amount values on the residence duration at different points in time.

duration credit_amount cross, 
personal_status job cross label_encode}

Explanation:

1. duration age plus 10 zscore: This feature combines the duration and age attributes to create a new feature that measures the latency of the customer taking a credit. By calculating duration + age, and then normalizing it using the z-score function, this feature captures the extent to which older customers take longer to take credits. It is beneficial to realize that older customers have been part of the market longer and may have established relationships with banks or other financial institutions, potentially affecting their speed in taking credits.

2. duration credit_amount cross: This feature generates a new categorical attribute by creating each combination of the duration and credit_amount feature levels. This cross product can reveal insights on how the duration of payment and the amount of credit taken are interrelated. For instance, customers who have shorter payment durations for larger credit amounts may have a higher tendency of paying back their debts on time. Conversely, customers with longer payment durations for the same amount of credit may be considered riskier.

3. personal_status job cross label_encode: This feature combines two categorical attributes to create a new categorical attribute. Here, personal_status and job are crossed and label-encoded to create new binary features for each combination of the two. This can help illustrate that certain occupational structures or demographic details could be grouped tighter than another group of attribution. For example, two make use distinctions in two make ways under variations of the job condition. Insufficient illustrations inform use combination.
