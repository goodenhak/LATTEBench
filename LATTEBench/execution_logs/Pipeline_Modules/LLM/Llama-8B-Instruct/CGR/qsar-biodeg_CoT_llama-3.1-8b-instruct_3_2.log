The following RPNs were created:
 
1. new_feature_1 = log(SpMax_L + J_Dz(e)): 
Results in a numerical feature that measures how much the sum of SpMax_L and J_Dz(e) deviates from the log of the mean of SpMax_L and J_Dz(e). 

2. new_feature_2 = cos(F02[C-N], nO): 
Results in a numerical feature that measures the cosine of the angle between F02[C-N] and nO. This can be used to capture the relationship between the two features and can help in distinguishing between the two classes.

3. new_feature_3 = neg(zscore(SdssC)): 
Results in a numerical feature that measures the z-score of SdssC after negating it. The z-score of a feature measures how many standard deviations it is from the mean, and the negative z-score of SdssC measures the number of standard deviations SdssC is from the negative of the mean of SdssC. This can be used to capture the spread of SdssC from the negative mean of SdssC.

{sqrt(f2) square, nX C% multiply, binary_equivalence(SpMax_B(m) greater 4.5, SpMax_L less 5.5)}

Explanation:

1. Extract the sqrt of the number of oxygen atoms (numerical), which might capture non-linear relationships between the original feature and the response.
	* sqrt(nO)
2. Multiply the number of halogen atoms by the percentage of C atoms. This could help reveal interactions between molecular structure and composition.
	* nX C% multiply
3. Create a new binary feature indicating if the leading eigenvalue from the Burden matrix weighted by mass (SpMax_B(m)) is greater than 4.5 and the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) is less than 5.5. This could be a new indicator feature that can help the model make more precise predictions.
	* binary_equivalence(SpMax_B(m) greater 4.5, SpMax_L less 5.5)

Note that I didn't use aggregate operators like groupbythenmean as we don't have a clear grouping key or aggregate function specified in the task.

2026-01-28 10:17:18,939 - INFO - LLM Output: {f3 f5 plus square, nO SdssC_C%_ratio_log ratio sq, c3 c7 hexbin}

Explanation:

1. First, I created a new feature by adding the product of SpMax_B(m) and NssssC to the square of F04[C-N].
   This is represented as f3 f5 plus square.

2. Then, I created another new feature by calculating the ratio of nO to SdssC_C%_ratio_log.
   This is because the mean of SdssC_C%_ratio_log is -12.6362, which is close to the minimum value, suggesting that most data points are on the negative side of the axis.
   By taking the ratio with nO, we can normalize the feature to be more symmetric, which can potentially improve the model's performance.
   This is represented as nO SdssC_C%_ratio_log ratio.

3. For the last feature, I transformed the categorical feature C% into numerical bins.
   We notice that C% has a wide range from 0 to 60, which can make the model prone to multicollinearity.
   By grouping C% into 6 bins using sigmoid and create a new numerical feature from that, we can create non-linear relationships between C% and other features.
   This is represented as c3 6 hexbin, which is equivalent to C% 6 sigmoid 5 bin.

Note: c3 is used for C%, 6 for bin number, sigmoid to get the probability of each point falling into a certain bin, and 5 for bin number in the output in Reverse Polish Notation

SpMax_L SpMax_B(m) square root plus f1 square}

Explanation:

1. Feature 1: f1 is SpMax_B(m) and f4 is NssssC. We create a new feature by multiplying f1 with f4 and then taking the logarithm of the result. We do this because there might be a non-linear relationship between these two features.

2. Feature 2: f2 is nO and SpMax_L is the eigenvalue from Laplace matrix. We create a new feature by dividing f2 by SpMax_L and then taking the logarithm of the result. This is because the relationship between the number of oxygen atoms and the eigenvalue from Laplace matrix might be non-linear.

3. Feature 3: We create a new feature by taking the log of the sum of the square root of (SpMax_L) and (SpMax_B(m)), a Pythagorean relationship might help.
