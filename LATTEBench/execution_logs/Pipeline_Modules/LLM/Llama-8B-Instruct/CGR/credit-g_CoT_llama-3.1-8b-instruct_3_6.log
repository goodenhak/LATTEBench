convert categorical to numerical via label encoding and use in new feature creation:

{credit_history retraining label_encode credit_duration diff, credit_history new_car label_encode credit_newcar_diff}
 these new features use credit history or purpose categories to create meaningful numerical values that can improve prediction performance.

issue binary target column entropy and the final goal is to understand if any feature's usage, categorized or numerical, or combined consequently will boost the downstream predictive model.

 New Feature 1: label_encrypting status of occupation

This new feature takes advantage of label encoding to convert job category into numerical values, allowing the model to better understand the importance of the job in the training process. This can potentially improve the predicting capacity of the model.

New Feature 2: Binning of duration

The existing_credits feature and credit_amount feature demonstrate a  positive correlation in the examples given. I believe that if 'existing_credits' increases, the credit_amount also tends to increase. This could be a possible target for a credit assessment. We can potentially bin the duration feature to better understand the interaction between duration and existing_credit   

New Feature 3: Greater sigmoid feature to investigate the  
Threshold for higher than median values

Avoid grouping features where categorical values don't support ranking in order without curvature

{credit_amount residence_since multiply, credit_history existing_paid equal credit_history critical_other_existing_credit_equal 2  label_encode one_hot, employment >=7 equal employment <=1 equal 1 cross}

The first new feature, credit_amount residence_since multiply, combines the credit_amount and residence_since features by taking their product, which may help capture the relationship between the amount of credit and the duration of residence.

The second new feature, credit_history existing_paid equal credit_history critical_other_existing_credit_equal 2  label_encode one_hot, transforms the credit_history feature into numerical features using one-hot encoding, but only for the cases where the credit history is either existing paid or critical/other existing credit. The 2 in the second label_encode is an arbitrary choice for the remaining category.

The third new feature, employment >=7 equal employment <=1 equal 1 cross, combines the employment features by asking whether the current employment has been longer or shorter than the 7-year mark, and then asking whether this employment has been a minority or a majority compared to all employment instances. If it's a minority, the cross product is the raw value, otherwise, it's 1.
