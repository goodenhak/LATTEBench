{numerical_feature credit_amount numerical_feature duration sqrt, numerical_feature age numerical_feature credit_amount multiply sigmoid, numerical_feature credit_amount numerical_feature savings_status label_encode cross}

Let me explain the chosen features:

1. numerical_feature credit_amount numerical_feature duration sqrt: This feature combines the credit amount and duration features by taking the square root of their product. This could capture non-linear relationships between the two variables.
2. numerical_feature age numerical_feature credit_amount multiply sigmoid: This feature multiplies the age and credit amount features and applies the sigmoid function to the result. This could capture interactions between the two variables in a non-linear way.
3. numerical_feature credit_amount numerical_feature savings_status label_encode cross: This feature uses the label encoding of the savings status feature and performs a cross product with the credit amount feature. This could capture interactions between the two categorical variables.

Note that I used label encoding for categorical features, as recommended, and also used a binning approach for converting categorical features to numerical features when necessary.

Explanation:
1. The first new feature is obtained by cross-product of credit_amount and employment. This could help capture the interaction effect between credit amount and employment duration on credit approval.
2. The second new feature is the lagged value of credit_amount binned by checking_status. This could be useful because it captures the pattern in the distribution of credit_amount for each category of checking_status, and could help the model identify relationships between the two variables.
3. The third new feature is credit_amount aggregated by the encoded version of other_parties. This operation captures the relationship at an aggregated level, enabling the mode to learn how different values of other_parties affect the distribution of credit_amount.

Note: I've assumed that you want to create new features based on the existing features. If you want to create new features from the Pareto front, we might have to use a different approach.

First, let's create a new feature by taking the logarithm of the product of credit_amount, checking_status label_encode and purpose label_encode:

(1) credit_amount checking_status label_encode cross purpose label_encode cross plus log

This could be a good candidate for improvement. By cross-label encoding checking_status and purpose, we're transforming the categorical variables into numerical ones, which are easier to work with, especially for numerical operations like log. 

Next, let's create another feature by subtracting credit_amount, checking_status label_encode from credit_amount, purpose label_encode:

(2) credit_amount purpose label_encode checking_status label_encode subtract

This feature is similar to the above one, except that we're subtracting the encoded checking_status from the product of credit_amount and purpose. 

Lastly, let's create another feature by taking the square root of the product of credit_amount, employment label_encode:

(3) credit_amount employment label_encode cross square

This feature is more focused on the employment situation. By taking the square root, we're capturing the effect of employment on the credit amount.

I used numerical_feature 5 bin for the bin conversion in checking_status. I're supposed to pick the best bin size for you, but a static bin size of 5 across all features should be a good starting point. Then I encode the categorical features into numerical ones and perform the operations.
