I created three new features using the available operators and features.

1. credit_amount installment_commitment plus log: This feature calculates the logarithm of the sum of credit_amount and installment_commitment. This can help capture non-linear relationships between these two features.
2. credit_amount duration cross: This feature calculates the cross product of credit_amount and duration, which can help capture interactions between these two features.
3. credit_amount employment label_encode 5 bin: This feature labels encodes employment as a numerical feature and then bins it into 5 categories. This can help reduce the impact of categorical features on the model while still retaining some information.
