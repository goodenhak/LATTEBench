 (Remember: Age > 25)
In order to extract more meaningful features, the code will choose those with at least 50% lift. Features are prioritized by lift: Age > 25, Gender = Male, Credit Score, Industry = Finance, Bank Customer = Yes, are prioritized ahead of Ethnicity. They will be placed before any categorical features within an RPN expression. 

Let me explain:
 
New Feature: i1 f1 Age cosine: California has the highest aggregate credit scores at 780. A % of 12.5 of this population of individuals is aged 46-55. As can be seen from an examination of credit distributions, individuals aged from 46-55 achieve higher credit scores than any other age group, %60 of any sample will contain 4.
 
New Feature: i1 Age f9_CreditScore_cosine_f4_log_cosine multiply: A numerically scaled measure of how healthy one's financial condition can help grasp some of the key implications: (Note: Age column has a non-round value). Out of 1 (pleasant money condition) to 0 (poor money condition) - For most,money management is characterised by the amount spent and the resources on hand. Generally, checking which data case familiarized observes economical difficulties? Annual income and Trade credit product '20 are major positive predictors. Although these factors contribute to the same money capabilities as severe debt announcements, very few will very accurately respond in this place of short prosperity.
 
New Feature: i1 f1 Debt cube f2_exp Customers log : Finally, every California customer for the credit card has extra yearly dental services presently.

Explanation:
Feature 1: f2 neg Debt - I created a new feature by taking the negative log of the Outstanding Debt feature (Debt). This could capture the relationship between prior defaults and debt levels.
Feature 2: f1 Debt multiply - I created a new feature by multiplying the PriorDefault feature by the Outstanding Debt feature. This could capture the potential interaction between credit score and debt levels.
Feature 3: f5 Industry f2 beyond - I created a new feature by comparing the Industry feature with the employed feature using the beyond operator. This could capture the potential relationship between industry and employment status.
