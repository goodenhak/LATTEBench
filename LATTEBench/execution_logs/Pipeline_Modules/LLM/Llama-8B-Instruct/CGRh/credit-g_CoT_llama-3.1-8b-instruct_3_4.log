Note: I created three new features based on the operators and features available.

1. The first feature is the average of age grouped by job, which I'll call recruitment_level_avg. This feature may be useful because it captures the average age across different job types, which could be related to creditworthiness.
2. The second feature is the binning of credit_amount based on savings_status, which I'll call credit_usage_level. This feature may be useful because it captures the relationship between credit amount and savings status, which could be related to creditworthiness.
3. The third feature is the label encoding of personal_status as a numerical feature, which may be useful for the downstream model.
