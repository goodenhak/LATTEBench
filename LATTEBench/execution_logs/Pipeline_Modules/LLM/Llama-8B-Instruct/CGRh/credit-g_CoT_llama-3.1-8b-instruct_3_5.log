Explanation:

- The first new feature is a categorical cross product between checking_status and credit_history, which captures the interaction between these two variables. This could be particularly useful because checking_status and credit_history both seem to be related to creditworthiness, and their combination might provide more information than either one alone.
- The second new feature is a ratio of duration to credit_amount. This captures the idea of how long the borrower has had the current checking account compared to the amount of the loan they are applying for. A higher ratio might indicate a borrower with a longer history of stable banking, which could be a positive factor.
- The third new feature is the difference between the average age (35.8917) and the actual age of the individual. This captures the idea of whether the individual is younger or older than the average, which could be a factor in their creditworthiness.

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind each new feature:

1. duration_credit_amount_cross_minmax: This feature calculates the interaction between duration and credit_amount, and then takes the minimum and maximum value across the categories, which can help capture non-linear interactions and provide more information about the target variable.

2. checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode_5_bin: This feature converts the categorical interaction between checking_status and credit_history into a numerical feature with 5 bins, which can help the model better understand the relationships between these two variables.

3. age_logarithm: Taking the logarithm of age can help to reduce the effect of outliers and make the relationship between age and the target variable more linear.

4. residence_since_4.0_plus_age_feature_extract_time: This feature adds the number of years the person has been residing in the current residence (taking the 4th value from the api, assuming it's a median) to the age, and then calculates the feature of extracting time from the resulting variable. This can help capture the effect of the person's residence duration on their creditworthiness.

5. age_alias_variable_0_square: This feature squares the age, which can help capture non-linear relationships and provide more information about how age influences the target variable.

wouldn't the square of credit_amount be a good feature? Therefore, a new feature that is the square of credit_amount.
age Cross labour_status because some people with low age may prefer to take out more loans, which would increase the credit amount of the loan-taker
checking_status, credit_history concatenate because these features together can convey useful information.
 
Here is the modified version with three of these new features added to the list:

These new features are designed to capture interactions and transformations between variables that may not be captured by the existing features.

The first feature, num_dependents age numerical sine multiply, multiplies the sine of the dependent count by the sine of the age, which may help to capture a non-linear relationship between the number of dependents and age.

The second feature, duration age sine multiply credit_amount numerical add, first multiplies the duration and age by the sine function, and then adds the credit amount. This may help to capture a non-linear interaction between the duration, age, and credit amount.

The third feature, age employment numerical cross numerical 5 bin, cross-tabulates the age with the employment years and bins the employment years into 5 categories. This feature may help to capture a categorical interaction between the age and employment years.

These features are designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationships between the variables, particularly in cases where the relationships are non-linear.
