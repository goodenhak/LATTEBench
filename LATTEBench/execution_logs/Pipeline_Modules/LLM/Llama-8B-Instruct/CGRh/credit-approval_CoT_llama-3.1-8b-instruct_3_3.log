2026-01-28 14:48:42,274 - INFO - LLM Output: I've added three new features to improve the prediction performance of the downstream model. Here they are in RPN:

{f1 f3 minus log, credit_score_cipher label_encode categorical_feature, race_binary 3 bin}

Explanation:

1. f1 f3 minus log:
This feature combines the Age and Debt features, taking their difference and applying a logarithmic transformation to reduce the effect of extreme values. This aims to normalize the data and potentially reduce multicollinearity.

2. credit_score_cipher label_encode categorical_feature:
This converts the CreditScore feature into a binary categorical feature by applying label encoding, where the credit score is categorized as 0 if it's below a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5) and 1 otherwise. The exact threshold value is to be determined based on the specific model and data analysis.

3. race_binary 3 bin:
This takes the Ethnicity feature and binarizes it into two categories (e.g., White and Non-White) to reduce overfitting with the categorical variable. The 3 indicates that there will be 3 bins: White, Non-White and Another (this is merely indicative, you might want to adapt to your categories and their numbers).

The total output of the new features will help to improve the prediction accuracy of the downstream model without overfitting to the existing variables.

This perspective features leverage on three aspects:
1. Squaring the credit_score and debt
2. Calculating a new feature related to zip code, income, by using the numerical and feature like numerical_feature
3. Transforming loan_status_and_not marital_status and citizenship into numerical features using label encoding
