2026-01-28 14:55:06,262 - INFO - LLM Output: I'll try to improve the feature set by generating three new features in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) format.

Here are my suggestions:

{credit_amount duration plus zscore, existing_credits numerical foreign_worker label_encode, credit_history numerical employment extract_time monthательных}

Explanation:
1. credit_amount duration plus zscore: This feature calculates the z-score of the sum of credit_amount and duration, which might help highlight cases where the combination of these two features is more significant than others.
2. existing_credits numerical foreign_worker label_encode: This feature converts the categorical foreign_worker variable into a numerical variable and combines it with existing_credits to create a new feature that may reveal interactions between the two.
3. credit_history numerical employment extract_time month: This feature takes the credit_history variable and converts it to a numerical representation by encoding it with label_encode. Then, I extract the month from the employment variable and combine these two features using a numerical operation (in this case, I chose not to perform an operation, but you can try f1 sigmoid f2, for example).

Note: I used a fixed bin number of 5 for the categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin type conversion, but in practice, you should experiment with different bin numbers to find the optimal one for your specific problem.

2026-01-28 14:55:09,341 - INFO - LLM Output: {f3 f4 multiply, f1 f3 multiply, f1 f4 cross f2 four bin}

Explanation:

1. Extract a new numerical feature that captures the interaction between credit history and employment. We use cross product and bin the employment feature into 4 categories.

f3 f4 cross f2 four bin

2. Create a new feature that is a combination of credit history and employment. We take their product.

f3 f4 multiply

3. Create a new feature that is a combination of credit history and credit amount. We take their product.

f3 f1 multiply

Note that you may need to adjust the number of bins in the {f1 f4 cross f2 four bin} and f1, f3, f4 are just example feature names, you should replace them with the actual feature names.

The bin operator is used to discretize the numerical feature, here we use 4 categories for employment.

The result is a list of three new features that can be used to improve the downstream model's performance.

These new features capture more nuanced interactions between the categorical variables and head towards improving the downstream model's performance.

1. checking_status savings_status cross generates a categorical feature that captures the relationship between the status of the checking and savings accounts.
2. duration savings_status cross captures how the duration of the loan is related to the savings status.
3. purpose credit_history cross creates a feature that considers the impact of the loan's purpose on the borrower's credit history.
