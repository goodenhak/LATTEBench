2026-01-27 22:26:52,300 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are my suggested next steps to generate new features:

1. <IncomeEncode<label_encode><Income>Income Label Encoding
The reasoning behind this step is to convert the Income feature into a categorical feature using label encoding, which can help the model learn non-linear relationships between income levels and the target variable. High-income individuals may have different behaviors and credit histories compared to low-income individuals, so this encoding can help capture those differences.

2. <DebtCategory>bin<Debt>Debt Binned Categories
The reasoning behind this step is to bin the Debt feature into categories (e.g., <0, 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, >20) which can help the model learn the relationship between debt levels and creditworthiness. This can also help to reduce the impact of outliers in the Debt feature.

3. <CreditScoreCategory>bin<Age>Age x CreditScore Interaction
The reasoning behind this step is to create a new feature by binning the CreditScore feature and then taking the interaction with the Age feature. This can help capture the non-linear relationship between credit score and age. For example, younger people with high credit scores may have different credit behaviors than older people with high credit scores.

These next steps introduce new features that can potentially improve the model's performance by capturing non-linear relationships and binned categories between the features and the target variable.

2026-01-27 22:29:59,869 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features provided and the goal of predicting which people are successful in applying for a credit card, here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Feature: Industry categorization and interaction with Debt
   New feature: <Industry encoded> is less than <Debt>
   Operator: less
   Feature1: Industry encoded (from label encoding the Industry categorical feature)
   Feature2: Debt
   New feature description: This feature captures the interaction between the job sector and the amount of debt a person has. Individuals from certain industries may have different creditworthiness profiles based on their debt.

2. Feature: Credit Score interaction with Years Employed
   New feature: <Credit Score> times <Years Employed>
   Operator: multiply
   Feature1: Credit Score
   Feature2: Years Employed
   New feature description: This feature captures the relationship between the credit score and the years of employment. A higher credit score combined with more years of employment might indicate a better creditworthiness profile.

3. Feature: BankCustomer indicator and ZipCode interaction
   New feature: <BankCustomer> is equal to <ZipCode> is greater than <Median ZipCode>
   Operator: equal and greater
   Feature1: BankCustomer
   Feature2: ZipCode, Median ZipCode
   New feature description: This feature captures the interaction between having a bank account (BankCustomer) and being located in a higher-income zip code (ZipCode greater than the median ZipCode). Individuals with a bank account in higher-income zip codes may have better credit profiles.

These new features aim to capture interactions and relationships between variables that might be indicative of creditworthiness, thereby potentially improving the downstream model's performance.

	* This step aims to capture non-linear relationships between CreditScore and Industry by encoding the categorical Industry feature as a one-hot representation.
2. YearsEmployed_bin<bin>CreditScore <binarize YearsEmployed based on credit score thresholds>
	* This step creates a new feature that categorizes YearsEmployed based on CreditScore thresholds, potentially highlighting employment patterns among individuals with varying credit scores.
3. Gender_cross_Employed<cross>Gender_Employed <calculate interaction term between Gender and Employed>
	* This step computes the interaction term between Gender and Employed, which may reveal interesting relationships between employment status and gender on the credit score outcome.

These suggestions aim to improve the model's performance by introducing new feature interactions and transformations that might better capture the underlying relationships in the data.

2026-01-27 22:30:46,173 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Age Calculation: <Age><square><YearsEmployed><PriorDefault><new_feature_description: Age squared summed feature>

This new feature captures the age of the individual in the dataset, which can be an important predictor of creditworthiness. I'm using the square operator to create a new feature that's the sum of the square of YearsEmployed and PriorDefault. This will capture non-linear relationships between age and prior default, which can be useful for the model.

2. Industry Feature Engineering: <MaterialsFeature><one_hot><Industry><new_feature_description: Industry feature engineering>

This new feature uses the one_hot operator to create a new feature that's a binarized version of the Industry feature. This can help the model capture nuanced differences between industries, which can be important for predicting creditworthiness.

3. Risk Score Calculation: <RiskScore><multiply><CreditScore><BankCustomer><new_feature_description: Risk score feature>

This new feature calculates a risk score for each individual based on their CreditScore and BankCustomer features. I'm using the multiply operator to create a new feature that's the product of these two features, which can capture the interaction between creditworthiness and bank customer status.

These features can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model by capturing additional information and relationships between the features. The first feature captures age-related information, the second feature captures industry-specific information, and the third feature captures the interaction between creditworthiness and bank customer status.
