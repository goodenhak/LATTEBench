2026-01-27 23:01:31,686 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Duration and Savings Status Interaction
<interaction_feature>cross<duration>savings_status This feature combines the duration and savings status to capture the relationship between the length of credit history and the amount of savings. This can help the model understand how the duration of credit history affects the likelihood of receiving credit.

2. Credit Amount and Employment Interaction
<employment_credit_feature>cross<employment>credit_amount This feature combines the employment status and credit amount to capture the relationship between job stability and the amount of credit applied for. This can help the model understand how job stability affects the likelihood of receiving credit.

3. Personal Status and Property Magnitude Interaction
<property_status_feature>cross<personal_status>property_magnitude This feature combines the personal status and property magnitude to capture the relationship between marital status and type of property owned. This can help the model understand how personal status affects the likelihood of receiving credit, potentially due to the influence of property ownership on creditworthiness.

These features are generated using the cross operator, which combines the values of two features to create a new feature. This can help capture complex relationships between features that may not be apparent from individual feature analysis.

2026-01-27 23:01:49,674 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and data, here are three possible next steps to generate features:

Step 1: Encoded checking status and employment
Encode the categorical features checking_status and employment to convert them into numerical representations.

orders<type_conversionncpy<checking_status>category</orders> credit_application - This feature encodes the checking status into numerical categories.

orders<type_conversionems<one_hot employed>category</orders> credit_application - This feature encodes the employment status into numerical categories.

Step 2: Credit amount and duration interaction
Create a feature that captures the interaction between credit amount and duration, as it may be related to the likelihood of receiving credit.

orders<square<credit_amount>multiplication<duration>credit_amount_demand</orders> credit_application - This feature is a square of credit amount multiplied by duration to represent the demand for credit.

Step 3: Guarenteer or co-applicant impact on credit
Create a feature that represents the impact of other debtors or guarantors on the likelihood of receiving credit.

orders<cosine<other_parties>categories</ -> This feature uses cosine similarity to represent the relationship between other_parties and existing credit history categories. 

These new features can potentially provide more information about the customer's creditworthiness and improve the model's performance. However, further exploration and experimentation are necessary to determine the actual impact of these features on the downstream model.

1. Feature engineering for credit_amount: We can create a feature that represents the percentage of credit_amount relative to the median credit_amount.

    <>
    <>bin<credit_amount>median_credit_amount<percentage_of_median_credit_amount_description>
    

    This feature will be useful for capturing the relative magnitude of credit_amount, which can help the model understand whether the applicant is asking for a large or small loan.

2. Feature engineering for employment: We can create a feature that represents the employment duration in years relative to the applicant's age.

    <>
    <>div<age>employment<employment_duration_relative_to_age_description>
    

    This feature will help the model understand whether the applicant has been employed for a long time compared to their age, which can be an indicator of stability and reliability.

3. Feature engineering for credit_history: We can create a feature that represents the difference in credit history compared to the applicant's age.

    <>
    <>diff<age>credit_history<credit_history_age_difference_description>
    

    This feature will help the model understand whether the applicant has a good credit history considering their age, which can be an indicator of financial responsibility.

These features aim to capture additional information about the applicant that can be useful for the downstream model to make better predictions.

2026-01-27 23:02:01,630 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. checking_status<one_hot><other_parties><posting a credit application with multiple credit lines and personal guarantee options>
	* Reasoning: One-hot encoding the categorical feature checking_status can help the model distinguish between different types of checking account statuses. By pairing it with other_parties, we can create a feature that captures the relationship between the type of checking account and the presence of multiple credit lines and personal guarantees.
2. credit_history<bin><credit_amount><capture whether credit history is moderate or high while considering the credit amount>
	* Reasoning: Binning the categorical feature credit_history can simplify the representation of credit history types. Pairing it with credit_amount can help the model understand whether the credit history is moderate or high while considering the credit amount.
3. employment<groupbythenmedian><duration><create a feature that captures the relationship between employment duration and credit duration>
	* Reasoning: Grouping the categorical feature employment by the median value of duration can create a feature that captures the relationship between employment duration and credit duration. This can help the model understand whether a borrower with a certain employment duration is more likely to receive credit.

These feature engineering steps aim to create new features that capture relationships between existing features, which may improve the downstream model's performance.

It seems I made an error earlier. Here are the corrected next steps to generate features:

1. <new_checking_status_crossentropy><cross><checking_status><credit_amount><Features for the credit_amount feature based on checking_status category> 
This feature combines the checking_status and credit_amount features, hinting at a relationship between the status of existing checking account and the credit amount. This could be useful because the checking_status feature is categorical, and one-hot encoding it might help the model understand the impact of different categories on credit amount.

2. <new_duration_binary><binary><duration><durationMedian> 
This feature creates a binary column from duration feature, where it takes value 1 if duration is greater than or equal to the median value and 0 otherwise. This could simplify the model's task as duration's non-linear impact can be replaced with a binary one.

3. <new_installment_commitment_age><label_encode><installment_commitment><age> 
This feature converts the installment_commitment feature into a numerical form based on the age feature, which might help the model understand how the installment rate changes with age.

2026-01-27 23:02:13,003 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. <new_checking_status_crossentropy>cross<checking_status><credit_amount>: This new feature combines the cross entropy loss from the new_checking_status_crossentropy and the checking_status to create a new categorical feature. This might help the model understand the relationship between the two, and how it affects the credit amount.

2. <credit_history>bin<credit_amount>: This new feature bins the credit_history according to the credit_amount, which might help the model understand the impact of credit history on the credit amount.

3. <savings_status>label_encode<job>: This new feature labels encodes the savings_status with the job, which might help the model understand the relationship between the savings_status and the job.

Here is the reasoning behind these steps:

The first step combines new_checking_status_crossentropy with checking_status to create a new feature, as the machine learning model might learn the interactions between categorical features. This is inspired by the interaction terms in logistic regression.

The second step bins credit_history based on credit_amount because considering both features together might help the model understand complex patterns between these two variables. This is inspired by bricklution feature engineering.

The third step labels encodes the savings_status with the job because the job might influence the savings behavior, which is expected to be correlated with the credit history.

1. <new_checking_status_crossentropy><bin><credit_amount> - This feature combines the binarized new_checking_status_crossentropy with the credit_amount feature to capture non-linear relationships between the two variables. This can help the model learn more complex patterns and improve its ability to distinguish between positive and negative outcomes.
2. confirm<cross><checking_status><credit_amount> - This feature calculates the product of the confirmation status of credit amount (which is a categorical feature) and credit amount, to represent the interaction between the two variables. This can help the model capture the joint effects of the variables and improve its performance on the downstream task.
3. engagement<cosine><new_checking_status_crossentropy><savings_status> - This feature calculates the cosine similarity between the new_checking_status_crossentropy and savings_status features. This can help the model capture the relationships between the two variables and identify patterns that are not immediately apparent, such as the shared underlying characteristics or correlations between the two variables.

Here's the reasoning behind these steps:

* The first step uses binarization to convert the numerical new_checking_status_crossentropy into a binary feature, which can help the model learn more interpretable and meaningful relationships with the credit_amount feature.
* The second step uses the cross operator to calculate the product of two categorical features, which can help capture the interaction between the two variables and improve the model's performance on the downstream task.
* The third step uses the cosine similarity metric to calculate the similarity between two categorical features, which can help identify patterns and correlations between the two variables that are not immediately apparent.

2026-01-27 23:02:38,016 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and target variable, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <'credit_amountCumsum'crosschecking_status'prendiacumulative sum of credit amount by checking status'>'
	* This feature aims to capture the cumulative effect of credit amounts based on different checking statuses. By crossing the credit amounts with checking statuses, we can create a new feature that captures the interaction between these two variables. The cumulative sum operator helps to highlight the trend in credit amounts over time.
2. <'credit_history_dummies'one_hot(credit_history)>'
	* Since credit history is a categorical feature, we can use the one-hot encoding operator to create new binary features for each category. This will help the model to better distinguish between different credit history types.
3. <'savings_status_rationalemployment'erration of savings status by employment level'>'
	* This feature aims to capture the relationship between savings status and employment level. By dividing the savings status by employment level, we can create a new feature that highlights the numerical relationship between these two variables. This can be useful for the model to better understand the interaction between these two features.

These steps aim to:

* Capture context-dependent patterns in the data (checking status and credit amount)
* Enable the model to better distinguish between categorical features (credit history)
* Capture the relationship between numerical features (savings status and employment level)

2026-01-27 23:02:43,881 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <experience_score>cross<credit_amount><credit_history>
Create a new feature called experience_score that represents the individual's credit experience based on their credit history. This can be achieved by using the cross operator to combine the credit history and credit amount features. The idea is that individuals with longer credit history and larger credit amounts may have better credit experience, which can be a good indicator of creditworthiness.

2. <savings_status_score>label_encode<checking_status><savings_status>
Create a new feature called savings_status_score that represents the individual's savings status based on their checking status. This can be achieved by using the label_encode operator to map the checking status and savings status features into a numerical format. This new feature can help capture the relationship between the individual's financial stability and their creditworthiness.

3. <credit_limit>cube<credit_amount><duration>
Create a new feature called credit_limit that represents the individual's available credit based on their credit amount and duration. This can be achieved by using the cube operator to square the credit amount and then multiply it by the duration. The idea is that individuals with longer credit durations and larger credit amounts may have a higher credit limit, which can be a good indicator of creditworthiness.

2026-01-27 23:02:53,689 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the operations, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

Step 1: Encode checking_status and credit_history as numerical values using Label Encode

<new_checking_statusEncode><label_encode><checking_status>Checking Status Label Encode
<new_credit_historyEncode><label_encode><credit_history>Credit History Label Encode

Reasoning: Both checking_status and credit_history are categorical features that might benefit from one-hot encoding to improve the model's understanding of their relationships with the target variable. Label encoding is a suitable choice as it assigns a numerical value to each category, and we can then use these encoded values in the model.

Step 2: Create a new feature that captures the relationship between credit_amount and duration

<new_credit_to_duration><divide><credit_amount><duration>Credit Amount to Duration Ratio
<new_credit_percentile><percentile><credit_amount>Percentile of Credit Amount

Reasoning: The relationship between credit_amount and duration might be non-linear, and a ratio might capture this relationship better than the raw values. The percentile feature can also provide insights into the credit amount distribution, which might be useful for the model.

Step 3: Create a new feature that captures the interaction between savings_status and employment

<new_savings_status><cross><savings_status><employment>Savings Status by Employment Type
<new_employment_category><bin><savings_status>Employment Category by Savings Status

Reasoning: The relationship between savings_status and employment might be complex, and a cross-feature can capture this interaction. The bin feature can provide a more detailed understanding of the employment categories based on savings status.

These suggestions aim to capture the relationships between the existing features and the target variable, as well as interactions between numerical and categorical features. The downstream model's performance might improve with these new features, but it's essential to evaluate their impact using metrics like AIC, BIC, or cross-validation.
