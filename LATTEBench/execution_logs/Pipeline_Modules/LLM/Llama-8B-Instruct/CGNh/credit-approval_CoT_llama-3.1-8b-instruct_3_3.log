2026-01-27 22:25:52,948 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. To encode categorical features, use one_hot:

นครicity<one_hot><categorical_feature Ethnicity of a person, encoded as a binary vector> 
Employed<one_hot><categorical_feature Citizen status, encoded as a binary vector> 
Industry<one_hot><categorical_feature Industry sector of the person's current or most recent job, encoded as a binary vector>

This step will create three new features for each of the categorical variables: Ethnicity, Citizen, and Industry. These features will help the model learn the impact of each categorical value independently, improving its ability to predict credit card applications.

2. To create nonlinear transformations of continuous features, use square, cube, log, exp, or pow to the power of other features:

 Debit<Cube><numerical_feature Debt> Non-linear debt transformation
Income<Sqrt><numerical_feature Income> Scaled income feature

These new features will allow the model to capture non-linear patterns and relationships between the original features, potentially improving its performance.

3. To create interaction effects between pairs of numerical features, use multiply, divide, square, or multiply after applying square or pow to the power of other features:

 Age<times><numerical_feature YearsEmployed> Interaction feature combining age and years employed
 CreditScore(divide)<numerical_feature Income> Interaction feature combining credit score and income

This step will create two new features that capture the interaction effects between the original features, which can provide valuable information for the model.

Here are the proposed next steps:

1. Ethnicity<one_hot>Industry<Ethnicity of a person, encoded as a binary vector>
2. age<times>YearsEmployed Interaction feature combining age and years employed
3. creditScore(divide)<Income> Interaction feature combining credit score and income

2026-01-27 22:26:01,322 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and data, here are three possible next steps to generate additional features that could potentially improve the performance of the downstream model:

1. encode_gender_race<label_encode><Ethnicity><new_feature> 
   Encoding the Ethnicity categorical feature into numerical labels can help the model capture underlying relationships between different ethnic groups and the target variable Success. This can be done using label encoding which replaces categories with numerical values.

2. exprace<sqrt><Income><YearsEmployed><new_feature>
   The squared root of the product of Income and YearsEmployed could provide information about the overall economic capacity of the individual which might be correlated with their creditworthiness. This could help the model understand how financial stability and employment history affect the likelihood of being successful in applying for a credit card.

3. expinc<exp><Income><new_feature>
   Exponentiating the Income feature could provide information about the scale at which income affects the likelihood of being successful in applying for a credit card. This could be particularly useful if there are diminishing returns to income beyond a certain point, and the model could learn to capture this non-linear relationship.

These feature engineering steps aim to transform and extract useful information from the existing features to potentially improve the predictive power of the model.

2026-01-27 22:26:06,756 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and data, here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <AgeHistogram_bins_breaks=10><Bins><Age> creates a feature that categorizes age into separate buckets based on decile, this may help the model better understand age distribution.
2. <Square><CreditScore> creates a feature that calculates the square of CreditScore, which may help the model model the relationship between credit score and creditworthiness non-linearly.
3. <Threshold_v0.5><CreditScore><CreditScore> creates a feature that calculates the binary threshold of CreditScore at 0.5, where values above 0.5 are labeled as 1 and values below 0.5 are labeled as 0. This may help the model captureCreditScore 's binary relationship with the target variable.

Each of these operations aims to introduce non-linearity and explore different representations of the existing features to improve the model's generalization and accuracy.

2026-01-27 22:26:12,578 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided data and features, here are three possible next steps to generate new features that may improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Income Grouping
<new_feature_name>bin||<Income><numerical_feature>(), due to the fact that income is a very important aspect of credit card applicants, binning it could help create more meaningful categories for the model to learn from. This would allow the model to capture the distribution of income values.

2. Employment Experience and Credit Score
<new_feature_name>cross||<YearsEmployed><CreditScore>, this feature generates a cross product of employment experience and credit score, capturing the idea of how employment experience affects credit score. A person with 10 years of employment and high credit score might be a more attractive credit card applicant than one with the same credit score but less employment experience.

3. Dependence on Industry
<new_feature_name>cross||<Industry><CreditScore>, this feature considers how various industries affect individuals' credit scores. Industries like Financials might be associated with higher credit scores due to financial stability and consistency, whereas other industries might have lower credit scores. By creating this new feature, we can potentially make the model more aware of the industry dependence on credit scores.

These new features aim to introduce more complex relationships between variables that might not be immediately apparent from individual features, enabling the model to learn from patterns that aren't readily visible in the original feature set.

1. <MarriedGamilySize>cross<BankCustomer,Married>MarriedGamilySize: This feature combines the number of married individuals and whether the individual has a bank account to capture the concept of family size and financial stability.
2. <PriorDefaultDebtRatio>ratio<Debt,PriorDefault> captures the impact of existing debt on creditworthiness, which could be a strong predictor of credit card success.
3. <YearsEmployedEmploymentStatus>one_hot<Employed,YearsEmployed> captures the concept of employment status as a categorical variable, which may interact with years employed to predict credit card success.

These features aim to capture relevant information about the individual, such as family size, debt-to-credit ratio, and employment status, that could improve the performance of the downstream model.

2026-01-27 22:26:23,419 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate additional features:

1. Gender_typeConvert_label_encode_Ethnicity<typeConvert_label_encode_Ethnicity>: This new feature converts the Ethnicity categorical feature into a numerical label encoding, which can help the model learn more nuanced representations of the different ethnic groups. By encoding the ethnicity variable in this way, we can help the model capture the distinct patterns between ethnicities.

2. CreditScore_crosstab_Industry<Apply crossfilter mapping for CreditScore to Industry>: This new feature applies a cross-tabulation of CreditScore and Industry, creating a new feature that shows the joint distribution of these two variables. This can help the model capture more complex relationships between these variables, for example, whether a particular industry tends to have lower or higher credit scores.

3. YearsEmployed_log_CreditScore<Annualized change credit score with age>: This new feature calculates the logarithm of YearsEmployed and CreditScore, representing a kind of annualized change in credit score over the years employed. This can help the model capture non-linear relationships between these variables, for example, the effect of years employed on credit score may grow as the number of years employed increases.

2026-01-27 22:26:28,264 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. <Married_Married_Indicator>cosine<Married> Married is an important factor in determining creditworthiness, and cosine similarity can help create a new feature that captures the strength of the marital status signal. This feature may improve the model's prediction of credit card approval for individuals who are married.

2. <Gender_one_hot_labelsna_Gender>one_hot<Gender> One-hot encoding the gender feature can help the model capture non-linear relationships between gender and other features. Ignoring the first row where the label is missing (na), we can create an additional feature that represents the probability of belonging to a particular gender category.

3. <CreditScore_exp_log_Income>plus<CreditScore><Income> The relationship between credit score and income may not be linear, so adding an exponentially transformed credit score to the income feature can create a new feature that captures the combined effect of these two variables on creditworthiness. This new feature may help the model better capture individuals with lower credit scores but high incomes.

2026-01-27 22:26:31,353 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <Income_bin Income> <bin <30> <Income>: This feature is created by binning the income feature into three categories: low (<30), medium (>=30 and <100), and high (>=100). This can help the model distinguish between different income groups and potentially improve its performance.
2. <CreditScore_square CreditScore>: This feature squaring the credit score feature can help the model capture non-linear relationships between credit score and the target variable.
3. <Employed_cosine Age/Employed>: This feature calculates the cosine between the employed feature and the age/employed ratio feature. The cosine metric measures the similarity between two vectors, and this can help the model capture complex relationships between employment status and age.

Note that these steps are based on the given features and their distributions, and the choice of features and operators depends on the domain knowledge and intuition of the analyst. These steps may need to be adjusted based on the actual performance of the model and further exploration of the data.

2026-01-27 22:26:38,867 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operators:

1. <JobSatisfaction cosine Industry> - This feature combines the Industry categorical feature with the cosine of the credit score and debt values. The idea is that people in certain industries may have different credit behaviors, and we can capture those differences by calculating the cosine similarity between credit scores and industry category embeddings.

2. <ZIPCode sqrt Income> - This feature calculates the square root of the income value and then takes the square root again. This can help to reduce the skew in the income distribution and may help the model to better capture the relationship between income and creditworthiness.

3. <Employed type<attach>age> - This feature converts the employed status into a binary value ( employed or not ) and then combines it with the age feature. The idea is that age can have different effects on creditworthiness depending on whether someone is employed or not. By cross-embedding these two features, we can capture these interactions in a new feature.
