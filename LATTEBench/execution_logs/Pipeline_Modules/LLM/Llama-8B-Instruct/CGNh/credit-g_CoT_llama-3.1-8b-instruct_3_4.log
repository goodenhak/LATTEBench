2026-01-27 22:53:05,493 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given data and the objective of improving the downstream model's performance, I'll suggest the following three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. Encoded Employees Status as Binary Feature <new_employment_encode><label_encode><employment> Encodes employment status into a numerical feature to capture its effect on credit approval.
2. Days Since Residence <new_residence_days><subtract><residence_since><max><age> Calculates the maximum life expectancy days since the person moved in, assuming an average life expectancy of 100 years. This captures the relationship between how long someone has lived in a place and their creditworthiness.
3. Credit-to-Installment Commitment Ratio <new_credit_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment> Calculates the ratio of credit amount to installment commitment, which could reveal the credit risk and embedded reliability of the person.

Below is the list of the suggestions written in the specified format:

1. _new_employment_encode<label_encode>employment(New feature to capture employment status)
2. _residence_days<subtract>residence_since<max>age(New feature to capture age x number of years living in a place)
3. _credit_ratio<divide>credit_amount/installment_commitment(New feature to calculate credit risk)

1.  
captial_usage<> square<> credit_amount<> credit_amount The reason for this is to create a feature that captures the relationship between the credit amount and the credit usage, which can be an important factor in determining whether the person receives credit.

2.  
installment_commitment<> cross<> checking_status<> credit_history The motivation behind this is to create a feature that combines the installment commitment rate with the checking status and credit history to capture any potential interactions or correlations between these factors.

3.  
age<> lag<> age<> <1 We do this since the age of the person might impact the likelihood of receiving credit. It might be more than last year's age for some clients so create a new feature that combines the current age with last year's age for the same clients.

2026-01-27 22:53:31,136 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. <checking_status_bin<numerical><checking_status><Checking Account Status Binarized by Duration>
2. <credit_amount_typecatateHistory><credit_history><credit_history><map Credit History to Intensity of Credit Amount>
3. <savings_status_hindership<existing_credits><savings_status><map Savings Status to Number of Existing Credits>

Explanation behind each step:

1. The idea is to create a new feature that binnarizes the checking account status based on the duration. This can help the model understand the relationship between the checking account status and the duration. The binning of the checking account status can help the model to understand the different categories of checking account status and how they relate to the duration.

2. This feature combines the credit history with the credit amount to create an intensity of credit amount. This can help the model to understand the relationship between the credit history and the credit amount. Different credit histories (e.g. existing paid vs. critical/other existing credit) may have different intensities of credit amount.

3. This feature maps the savings status to the number of existing credits. This can help the model to understand the relationship between the savings status and the number of existing credits. For example, a person with no known savings may have a different relationship with the number of existing credits compared to a person with savings.

1. <checking_status_label_encode<checking_status>converted_categorical_feature_checking_status_description> 
   The goal here is to convert the categorical checking status into a numerical label, which can then be used in numerical operations. Label encoding is a common technique used to replace categorical features with numerical values.

2. <duration_zscore<duration>normalized_duration_description> 
   The goal here is to standardize the duration values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can help improve the model's performance by making the features more comparable.

3. <purpose_bin<purpose>value_counts_description> 
   The goal here is to convert the categorical purpose into a numerical value, where the value corresponds to the frequency of each purpose in the dataset. This can help capture the distribution of purpose values and provide additional information for the model.

These are just a few examples of possible next steps. I'll keep exploring to find more useful feature engineering opportunities.

2026-01-27 22:53:48,864 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features, here are 3 possible next steps to generate new features that can improve the model's performance:

1. <is_weekend> <is_weekend> <age> <Additional Feature: Is the person's age consistent with the weekend activities?>: This could help the model to capture whether the person's age is consistent with their credit score, as certain credit scores are associated with specific age groups. By using the isWeekend() function, we can create a new binary feature that indicates whether the person's age is consistent with the weekend activities.

2. <cube> <credit_amount> <credit_amount> <Feature to capture the effect of credit amount on credit score>: This could help the model to capture the non-linear relationship between credit amount and credit score. Taking the cube of the credit amount can reveal the effect of larger credit amounts on credit scores.

3. <cross> <credit_history> <purpose> <New categorical feature showing how purpose affects credit history categories>: This can help the model to understand the impact of different purpose categories on the credit history. The cross_join() operator will create a new categorical feature that combines the categories of credit_history and purpose, allowing the model to learn more nuanced relationships between the two features.

Here are the original instructions in code format:

1.<is_weekend>cross<is_weekend><age><Additional Feature: Is the person's age consistent with the weekend activities?>
2.<cube>cube <credit_amount><credit_amount><Feature to capture the effect of credit amount on credit score>

1. <Additional Feature: Creditworthy Score><target_encoding><credit_history><Personal creditworthiness encoded label for credit history>
The reasoning behind this step is to encode the credit history into a numerical label, which can be used as a feature for the model. This is done because the original credit history is categorical, and by encoding it into a numerical label, we can potentially capture more nuanced differences between the categories.

2. <checking_status_category><label_encode><checking_status><Category label for checking status to help model understand its significance>
The reasoning behind this step is to convert the checking status, which is numeric, into a categorical label that the model can understand. This can be helpful because the model may be able to learn more complex relationships between the numerical values and the outcome.

3. <is_creditworthy><max><credit_amount><existing_credits><Max credit amount available based on existing credits and creditworthiness>
The reasoning behind this step is to create a new feature that captures the maximum credit amount available to the individual based on their existing credits and creditworthiness. This feature can potentially help the model understand the maximum credit capacity of the individual, which can be a strong predictor of creditworthiness.

1. <Credit History Score Difference><diff><Creditworthy Score><credit_history><Calculate the difference between Creditworthy Score and credit history to understand creditworthiness over time>
	* This feature combines two existing features to create a new one that might be useful for the model. It calculates the difference between the creditworthiness score and the credit history, which could provide additional information about the creditworthiness of the individual.
2. <Checking Status Category BIN><bin><checking_status_category><credit_amount><Categorize checking status category based on credit amount>
	* This feature uses the bin operator to categorize the checking status category based on the credit amount. This can help the model understand the relationship between checking status and credit amount, which could be important for predicting whether a person receives credit.
3. <Creditworthiness Rank><rank><is_creditworthy>< Creditworthiness encoded label for credit history>><Create a rank-based feature for creditworthiness to identify top and bottom performers>
	* This feature uses the rank operator to generate a new feature that ranks individuals based on their credit worthiness. This can help the model identify top and bottom performers, which could be useful for predicting creditworthiness.

The reasoning behind these steps is to generate new features that can help the model better understand the relationships between the existing features. By creating new features through combining or transforming existing ones, we can provide more information to the model and potentially improve its accuracy.

2026-01-27 22:54:13,648 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Credit History based on Creditworthiness
<new_feature_name: Credit History based on Creditworthiness><target_encoding><Checking Status Category><Creditworthy Score><new_feature_description: Target encode checking status category based on creditworthy score>

Reasoning: The creditworthy score feature is highly correlated with the target variable, and target encoding the checking status category based on this feature could capture non-linear relationships between these variables.

2. Existing Credits to Total Income Ratio
<new_feature_name: Existing Credits to Total Income Ratio><divide><is_creditworthy><credit_amount><new_feature_description: Calculate the ratio of existing credits to total income>

Reasoning: This feature can capture the proportion of income spent on existing credits, which may be relevant for credit approval decisions. Note that we are using the divide operation to ensure that at least one of the inputs is numerical.

3. Age and Income Relationship
<new_feature_name: Age and Income Relationship><cross><age><credit_amount><new_feature_description: Create a cross-feature between age and credit amount to capture their joint relationship>

Reasoning: Age and credit amount may be related in non-linear ways, and creating a cross-feature between them could reveal hidden patterns in the data. This feature may be particularly useful for capturing the relationship between these variables in specific age groups.
