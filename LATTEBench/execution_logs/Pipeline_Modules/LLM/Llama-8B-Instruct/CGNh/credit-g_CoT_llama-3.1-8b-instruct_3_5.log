2026-01-27 22:55:28,566 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. checking_status_augmented: <label_encode><checking_status><checking_status> This new feature encodes the checking_status category as a numerical value, which may improve the model's ability to distinguish between different categories. The label_encode operator maps each category to a unique integer, allowing the model to learn distinct patterns for each category.
2. credit_history_encoded: <bin><credit_history><duration> This new feature creates a binary variable for credit_history, where 1 indicates a good credit history (e.g., existing paid or all paid) and 0 indicates a poor credit history (e.g., critical/other existing credit or delayed previously). The bin operator categorizes the credit_history feature based on the duration of the loan, allowing the model to account for the impact of credit history on loan duration.
3. age_residenceissippi: <cross><age><residence_since> This new feature creates a new categorical variable by combining age and residence_since features. The cross operator creates all possible combinations of the two features, resulting in a new feature with a large number of categories. This may help the model capture interactions between age and residence_since and improve its ability to predict credit approvals.

These next steps aim to improve the downstream model's performance by:

* Encoding categorical features (checking_status) to improve model learning
* Creating binary features (credit_history_encoded) to simplify the model and improve interpretability
* Capturing interactions between features (age_residenceissippi) to improve model accuracy

2026-01-27 22:56:06,536 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators:

1. Age categorization
python
<age_cat>bin<age>describe age categorization by bins

This feature generates a new categorical feature age_cat by binning the age feature into distinct age groups (e.g., 20-30, 31-40, etc.). This can help improve the model's performance by capturing non-linear relationships between age and the target variable.

2. Employment status encoding
python
<employment_enc>label_encode<employment>encode employment status using labels

This feature encodes the employment categorical feature using labels (e.g., unemployed, skilled, etc.). This can help the model learn more meaningful representations of employment status and improve its ability to distinguish between different employment categories.

3. Credit amount ratio
python
<credit_ratio>ratio<credit_amount><savings_status>calculate ratio of credit amount to savings

This feature calculates the ratio of credit_amount to savings_status (after converting the categorical feature to numerical using label_encode). This can help the model capture the relationship between credit amount and savings status, which may be important for predicting credit approval.

These three features are designed to capture non-linear relationships, encode categorical features, and create new relationships between variables that may be useful for the downstream model.

2026-01-27 22:56:35,679 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and the task of predicting whether a person receives credit or not, here are three possible next steps to generate features that may improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Extractor of Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit based on credit history: The credit history feature is categorical, and it could be useful to transform it into a numerical feature that captures its distributional properties. We can use the label_encode operator to convert the credit history into numerical labels and then use the rank operator to compute the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic. This feature can help the model understand the relationship between the credit history and the probability of receiving credit.

   credit_history_rank<label_encode><credit_history><describe the goodness of fit statistic based on credit history>

2. Aggregate Properties of Credit Amount: The credit_amount feature is numerical and is related to the amount of credit being applied for. We can use the groupbythenmax operator to compute the maximum credit amount applied for in a group of people with similar credit histories. This feature can help the model understand how the credit amount changes across different credit histories.

   max_credit<groupbythenmax><credit_history><credit_amount><describe the maximum credit amount for each credit history>

3. Installation Rate over Lifetime Employment: The employment feature is categorical and captures information about the length of employment. We can use the label_encode operator to convert the employment into numerical labels and then use the rolling_mean operator to calculate the rolling mean of the installment rate over the lifetime of employment. This feature can help the model understand how the installment rate changes over the course of employment.

   roll_mean_installment<rolling_mean><installment_commitment><convertiratesuplabel_encode><employment><describe the rolling mean installment rate over the lifetime of employment>

Note that the new feature description should mention the meaning or interpretation of the new feature.

2026-01-27 22:57:12,858 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and the goal of predicting whether a person receives a credit, I'll suggest the following three next steps to generate new features:

1. Feature 3: interaction between checking status and savings status
	* <checking_status><cross><savings_status><new_feature_interaction>

Rationale: The interaction between checking status and savings status can provide valuable information for the model. By combining these two features, we can capture the impact of having a checking account and savings status on credit approval.

2. Feature 4: Encoding credit history and other payment plans
	* credit_history><one_hot><credit_history><new_feature_credit_history>
	* other_payment_plans><one_hot><other_payment_plans><new_feature_other_plans>

Rationale: The current credit history and other payment plans features are categorical, but one-hot encoding can convert them into binary features that may help the model better understand the importance of each category.

3. Feature 5: Age-based quantiles of new feature job rank
	* <new_feature_job_rank><cross><age><new_feature_age_quantile>

Rationale: Age is a significant factor in credit approval, and the job rank might also be related to creditworthiness. By creating a feature that combines the age and job rank, we can create a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between these two variables.

Please let me know if you'd like me to provide more suggestions or elaborate on these proposals!

2026-01-27 22:57:16,535 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <new_feature_risk_score><cross><new_feature_credit_risk><credit_history>: This feature combines the credit risk category with the credit history category to create a new feature that captures the relationship between these two factors. The cross operator is used to create a new categorical feature with all possible combinations of the two input features.

2. <new_feature_employment_history><groupbythenmean><duration><credit_history>: This feature groups the data by employment history and calculates the mean duration and credit history for each group. This can help to identify patterns in employment history that are associated with different credit outcomes.

3. <new_feature_age_category><bin><age><new_feature_description>: This feature bins the age feature into categories (e.g. young, middle-aged, old) to create a new categorical feature that can be used in the model. This can help to reduce the impact of age outliers and improve the model's interpretability.

Note: The new_feature_description can be any descriptive string that provides context for the new feature, but it does not affect the feature generation process.

2026-01-27 22:57:21,913 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and data types, here are three possible next steps to generate features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Feature: interaction between credit history and checking status
python
<new_feature_credit_status_interaction><cross><credit_history><checking_status>

Reasoning: The credit history and checking status are both categorical features that could have a non-linear relationship with the target variable. By generating a new feature that captures their interaction, we may be able to capture complex patterns in the data that could improve the model's performance.

2. Feature: new_feature_age_category as a numerical feature
python
<new_feature_age_category_ranks><rank><new_feature_age_category>

Reasoning: The new_feature_age_category is currently a categorical feature, but we can convert it to a numerical feature by ranking its categories. This could help the model learn a more nuanced representation of age.

3. Feature: a ratio of duration to residence_since
python
<duration_residence_ratio><delete><duration><residence_since>

Reasoning: Both duration and residence_since are numerical features that may have a relationship with the target variable. By calculating their ratio, we may be able to capture a more nuanced aspect of the individual's creditworthiness.

Note that I've assumed the operators and feature combinations based on the information provided. The actual performance of these features should be evaluated using techniques like cross-validation to ensure they improve the downstream model's performance.

2026-01-27 22:57:26,812 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and operators provided, here are three possible next steps to generate new features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <new_feature_job_rank><dot><age><new_feature_age_category> 

   The reasoning behind this step is to explore the correlation between job rank and age, and how it varies across different age categories. This could provide insights into how job experience and age influence the likelihood of receiving a credit.

2. <saving_status><cross><duration><installment_commitment> 

   We cross the categorical savings_status with the numerical features duration and installment_commitment to understand the combined relationship between these variables and the target variable. This could help the model identify complex patterns and interactions between categorical and numerical features.

3. <new_feature_credit_risk><one_hot><credit_history> 

   We one-hot encode the categorical new_feature_credit_risk feature using the credit_history feature as the key. This could help the model better understand the nuances of credit risk in different scenarios and provide more accurate predictions.

These generated features can potentially improve the model's performance by introducing new information, interactions, and relationships between variables that were not previously accounted for.
