2026-01-27 23:19:50,629 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Interaction between chemical properties and molecular structure
   <New_Propensity><cross><nCb-><SpMax_L><description: Propensity for biodegradability based on the interaction between the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) and the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix> 

   Reasoning: The number of substituted benzene C(sp2) (nCb-) and the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) are both related to the molecular structure. By taking their cross product, we can capture the interaction between these two features, which might be useful for predicting biodegradability.

2. Encode categorical features using target encoding
   <New_Encoded_C-026><label_encode><C-026><description: Encoded C-026 feature using target encoding> 

   Reasoning: C-026 is a categorical feature that represents a specific type of molecular structure. By using target encoding, we can transform this categorical feature into a numerical one that is more easily interpretable by the model. This might help the model capture non-linear relationships between C-026 and the target variable.

3. Aggregate molecular properties using groupbythen operators
   <New_Aggregated_Psi_i_A><groupbythenmean><nX><Psi_i_A><description: Mean of intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index type S average for each group of halogen atoms> 

   Reasoning: The intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index type S average (Psi_i_A) is a molecular property that might be affected by the presence of halogen atoms (nX). By grouping the data by nX and taking the mean of Psi_i_A for each group, we can capture the aggregated effect of nX on Psi_i_A. This might help the model identify patterns in the data that are related to the target variable.

2026-01-27 23:19:59,146 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Target Encoding of new feature
<New_Q1_Psi_i_A><label_encode><Psi_i_A><description: Target encode Psi_i_A by its own quartile>

Reasoning: Target encoding can help in capturing the variations in the target variable. By encoding the q1 psi_i_a feature, we can create a new feature that captures the influence of psi_i_a on the target variable. This feature can capture non-linear relationships between psi_i_a and the target variable.

2. Combination of two numerical features
<New_Sum_SpMax_L_SpMax_B><add><SpMax_L><SpMax_B(m)>,<description: Sum of SpMax_L and SpMax_B>

Reasoning: Combining two numerical features can help in capturing the interactions between them and can provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between the features and the target variable. By summing SpMax_L and SpMax_B, we can capture the joint effect of both features on the target variable.

3. Ranking-based feature
<New_Psi_i_A_rank><rank><Psi_i_A><description: Ranking of Psi_i_A within its own group>

Reasoning: Ranking-based features can be useful in capturing the relative position of a feature within its own group or category. By ranking Psi_i_A, we can capture the relative influence of Psi_i_A within its own quartile, which can be particularly useful in cases where the relationships between features and the target variable are non-linear.

2026-01-27 23:20:06,491 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given data, I would suggest the following three possible next steps to generate features that could potentially improve the performance of the downstream model:

1. WI expiry complementarity of New_Propensity and SpMax_L: 
  <new_feature_name>New_Propensity_Comp_SpMax_L<cross><New_Propensity><SpMax_L><description: Complementary interaction between propensity for biodegradability and the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix>

Applying the cross operator (think inner product) between two features can reveal some forms of relationships even when there's no visible linear correlation between them.

2. nCb- variance with nO: 
  <new_feature_name>nCb_nO_diff<diff><nCb-><nO><description: Difference between the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) and oxygen atoms>

As the variance of one feature can be impacted by another, examining their difference may yield some relevant insights.

3. Ratio of F03[C-O] and ChI: 
  <new_feature_name>Ratio_F03_Chi<ratio><F03[C-O]><C-026><description: Ratio of the frequency of C - O at topological distance 3 to number of R--CX--R>

2026-01-27 23:20:13,633 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the dataset and the previous features, here are three possible next steps to generate additional features:

1. Interactions between New_Propensity and nCb-
To explore the relationship between the propensity for biodegradability and the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) atoms, we can calculate the interaction between New_Propensity and nCb-. This can be done using the cosine function.

<New_Propensity><cosine><nCb-><description: Interaction between propensity for biodegradability and number of substituted benzene C(sp2) atoms>

2. Quantile normalization of SdO
Since SdO is a numerical feature with a high variance, we can apply quantile normalization to it, which can help to stabilize its distribution and improve the model's performance. We'll use the invert of SdO to do this, which is equivalent to applying the quantile normalization.

<New_SdO_quantile><minmax><SdO><description: Quantile normalized SdO>

3.  encoding for New_Propensity
The feature New_Propensity is a categorical feature and has a limited number of categories. We can leverage its categorical information using label encoding, which could improve the model's performance.

<New_Propensity><label_encode><New_Propensity><description: Label encoded propensity for biodegradability>

These new features can help to provide more insight into the relationships between the features and potentially improve the model's performance.

2026-01-27 23:20:21,821 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. <New_SpMax_L_nO><cross><SpMax_L><nO><description: Complementary interaction between leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix and number of oxygen atoms>

Reasoning: The leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) and the number of oxygen atoms (nO) are both numerical features. By taking their cross product, we can create a new feature that combines the information from both features. This new feature might be useful for capturing non-linear relationships between the two features.

2. <New_TI2_L_SpMax_L><sqrt><TI2_L><SpMax_L><description: Square root of the product of second Mohar index from Laplace matrix and leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix>

Reasoning: Both the second Mohar index from Laplace matrix (TI2_L) and the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) are numerical features. Taking their product and then calculating the square root might help to stabilize the feature and reduce the impact of outliers. This new feature might be useful for modeling the relationships between these two features.

3. <New_Propensity_new groups><groupbythenmean><New_Propensity><description: Mean of propensity for biodegradability by number of ring tertiary C(sp3)>

Reasoning: The propensity for biodegradability (New_Propensity) is a categorical feature. By grouping the data by the number of ring tertiary C(sp3) (nCrt) and calculating the mean of New_Propensity for each group, we can create a new feature that captures the relationships between biodegradability and the number of ring tertiary C(sp3). This new feature might be useful for modeling the relationships between biodegradability and molecular structure.

2026-01-27 23:20:46,170 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given data and accepted features, here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. Target encoding of SpMax_L by Quartile of nO
bash
<New_SpMax_L_by_nO_quartile><groupbythenmean><SpMax_L><nO><description: Mean of leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix by number of oxygen atoms group>

This feature aims to capture the relationship between the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) and the number of oxygen atoms (nO). By grouping the data by quartile of nO, we can examine how the mean of SpMax_L changes across different groups of oxygen atom counts. This could provide valuable insights for the downstream model.

2. Interaction between New_Propensity and SpMax_B(m)
bash
<New_Propensity_SpMax_B(m)_interaction><cross><New_Propensity><SpMax_B(m)<description: Interaction between propensity for biodegradability and leading eigenvalue from Burden matrix weighted by mass>

This feature combines the Propensity for biodegradability based on the interaction between the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) and the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (New_Propensity) with the leading eigenvalue from Burden matrix weighted by mass (SpMax_B(m)). This could reveal how these two features interact and impact the downstream model.

3. Sine of F03[C-O]
bash
<Sin_F03[C-O]><sine><F03[C-O]<description: Sine of frequency of C - O at topological distance 3>

This feature transforms the frequency of C - O at topological distance 3 (F03[C-O]) into a sine value, which may reveal non-linear patterns or relationships that might be hindered by the linear distribution of the original feature.

2026-01-27 23:21:01,745 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <New_Psi_i_A_Median><groupbythenmedian><Psi_i_A><description: Psi_i_A by class of biodegradability>: This step involves grouping the data by class of biodegradability (binary) and calculating the median of Psi_i_A within each group. The median can provide a measure of central tendency that is robust to outliers, and using it as a feature may help improve the downstream model's performance.

2. <New_SpPosA_B_p_score><sqrt><SpPosA_B(p)><description: Square root of SpPosA_B(p)>: This step involves taking the square root of SpPosA_B(p), which may help to reduce the skewness of the feature and make it more useful for the downstream model. The square root operation is chosen because SpPosA_B(p) seems to be a measure of some kind of score or value, and taking its square root may help to normalize it in some way.

3. <New_Psi_i_A_range><cross><Psi_i_A><SpMax_L><description: Interaction between Psi_i_A and SpMax_L>: This step involves calculating the interaction between Psi_i_A and SpMax_L, which are two features that seem to be related to some kind of molecular properties or descriptors. The interaction can provide more information about the relationship between the two features and may help the downstream model to better understand the data.

2026-01-27 23:21:16,712 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Interaction between New_Propensity and SpMax_L

<New_Propensity_SpMax_L><cross><New_Propensity><SpMax_L><description: Interaction between propensity for biodegradability and the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix>

This feature combines the encoded Propensity for biodegradability with the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix, which may capture non-linear relationships between these two variables. The cross operator allows us to explore the interaction between these two features, which may provide additional insights for the model.

2. Normalizing SdssC

<New_SdssC_norm><minmax><SdssC><description: Normalized SdssC>

SdssC has a non-linear distribution with negative values, which may affect the model's performance. Normalizing this feature using the minmax operator can help to improve the model's robustness and stability.

3. Ranking of F03[C-O] within its own group

<New_F03[C-O]_rank><rank><F03[C-O]><description: Ranking of F03[C-O] within its own group>

F03[C-O] is a feature with a large range of values (0-40). Ranking this feature within its own group can help to identify patterns and relationships that may not be apparent from the original values. This can provide additional insights for the model and improve its performance.

These three features aim to capture non-linear relationships, normalize non-linearly distributed features, and explore ranking-based relationships, which can potentially improve the downstream model's performance.

2026-01-27 23:21:20,333 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided data and existing features, here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

Step 1
Create a new feature that represents the interaction between the number of oxygen atoms (nO) and the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (SpMax_L).
sql
<New_SpMax_L_nO><cross><nO><SpMax_L><description: Interaction between leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix and number of oxygen atoms>

This feature can help capture the relationship between the molecular structure and the biodegradability of the chemicals.

Step 2
Create a new feature that is the label-encoded version of the number of oxygen atoms (nO).
sql
<New_nO_encode><label_encode><nO><description: Label-encoded number of oxygen atoms>

This feature can help the model to better understand the distribution of oxygen atoms in the chemical structures.

Step 3
Create a new feature that is the square root of the mean first ionization potential (Mi).
sql
<New_Mi_sqrt><sqrt><Mi><description: Square root of mean first ionization potential>

This feature can help the model to capture the relationship between the first ionization potential and the biodegradability of the chemicals in a different way.

These new features can be added to the existing feature set and evaluated for their performance in the downstream model.
