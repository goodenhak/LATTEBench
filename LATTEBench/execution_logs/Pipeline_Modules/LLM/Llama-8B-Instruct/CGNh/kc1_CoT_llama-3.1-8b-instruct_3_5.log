2. Encoding Categorical Variables

These new features aim to capture additional information about code complexity, operational density, and effort per operator. The square root of the ratio in step 1 helps to account for the scale of the unique operators to the line count. In step 2, the effort is only considered for non-comment lines to provide a more accurate measure. In step 3, the cyclomatic complexity is adjusted by the number of unique operators to capture the complexity of the code in terms of both cyclomatic complexity and operational density.

1. Unique Operators Ratio
<>zscore<uniq_Op><total_Op><new_feature_description: The ratio of unique operators to total operators, measured in z-scores to highlight outliers. This feature can help capture the complexity and diversity of the code.

2. Branch Count vs. Line Count

<>cross<ev(g)<iv(g)<new_feature_description: The interaction between cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and essential complexity (ev(g)). This feature can help capture the relationship between code complexity and maintainability.

These features are designed to:

* Capture relationships between different code metrics (e.g., branch count vs. line count)
* Highlight outliers and patterns in code complexity (e.g., unique operators ratio)
* Identify interactions between different code complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic vs. essential complexity)

These features are chosen based on the following reasoning:

* Line count and branch count are closely related to code complexity, and examining their relationship can provide insights into code structure and maintainability.
* Unique operators ratio can help capture the diversity and complexity of the code, which is an important aspect of software quality.
* Interactions between complexity metrics can provide valuable insights into code behavior and maintainability, and can help identify potential issues or areas for improvement.

1. Absolute Difference in McCabe and Halstead Complexity: Measure the absolute difference between McCabe's cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and Halstead's volume (v) to capture the relative complexity of the code.

<McCabe_Cyclomatic_Complexity_minus_Halstead_Volume> subtract <v(g)> <v> <absolute difference between McCabe and Halstead complexity, capturing relative code complexity>

2. Binary Encoding of Program Length: Encode the program length (l) as a binary feature to capture the ordinal nature of the feature.

<Program_Length_binary> bin <l> <binary encoding of program length, capturing ordinal information>

3. Groupbythen Mean of Operators and Operands: Group the unique operators (uniq_Op) and operands (uniq_Opnd) by their counts and calculate the mean of each group. This will help capture the distribution of operators and operands in the code.

<Operators_Groupbythen_Mean> groupbythenmean <uniq_Op> <mean of unique operators, capturing operator distribution>

1. <locCodeAndCommentCodensity>cross<uniq_Op><locCodeAndComment>  
This feature combines the density of comments and code with the uniqueness of operators. It's reasonable to assume that modules with unique operators may have more complex code, and the density of comments and code might be indicative of the level of complexity. This feature could capture the relationship between operator uniqueness and comment/code density.

2. <branchCountCuS>rolling_mean<branchCount>  
This feature calculates the cumulative sum of the branch count and then takes its rolling mean. It's likely that modules with higher branch counts have more complex logic, and the rolling mean of the cumulative sum could help capture the overall complexity of the module.

3. <locDensSeq>cross<l><v(g)>  
This feature combines the density of code with the cyclomatic complexity. It's reasonable to assume that modules with higher cyclomatic complexity might have more complex code, and the density of code could be indicative of the level of complexity. This feature could capture the relationship between code density and cyclomatic complexity.

2026-01-27 23:15:25,996 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. local_encode_branchCount_loc<>label_encode<branchCount><loc><Indicates whether the code has reported defects based on branch count and line count>
This step is a type conversion, using label_encode operation on branchCount (categorical feature) and loc (numerical feature), creating a new feature that represents whether the code has reported defects based on both complexity metrics.
2. cube(e)<n<>e<>This will calculate the cube of effort (e) given the total operators count (n), potentially helping to understand the relationship between effort and the number of operators>
This step uses the cube operator to transform the effort feature (e) in a non-linear way, based on the total operators count (n), potentially highlighting a non-linear relationship between effort and the number of operators.
3. rank(total_Opdefs>total_Op)<ev(g)<The rank of total operators against essential complexity, to understand which ones have more or lessdefs based on the property 
This step uses the rank operator to rank the total operators count (total_Op) based on the essential complexity (ev(g)) of the code, potentially identifying which codes have more or less definitions based on their properties.

2026-01-27 23:15:33,040 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Mutual Information-based Feature Engineering
   <uniq_Op, max, min, uniq_Opnd><roll_meanSegoe:cUMSUM><uniq_Opnd><mutual info> Measure the mutual information between unique operators and unique operands, and use this information to create a feature.
   <uniq_Opnd><roll_meanSOreg?:cumsum><unique_operators><mutual info> Measure the mutual information between unique operands and unique operators, and use this information to create a feature.

2. Rank-based Feature Engineering
   <loc><rank><branchCount> Create a new feature by ranking the lines of code (loc) based on the branch count.
   <uniq_Op><rank><total_Op> Create a new feature by ranking the unique operators (uniq_Op) based on the total operators (total_Op).

3. Grouping-based Feature Engineering
   <loc><groupbythenmean><0 then> Create a feature by grouping the code by lines of code and calculating the mean.

I chose these steps because they seem to create values that are more likely to be related to the outcome (existence of defects) of the downstream model.
