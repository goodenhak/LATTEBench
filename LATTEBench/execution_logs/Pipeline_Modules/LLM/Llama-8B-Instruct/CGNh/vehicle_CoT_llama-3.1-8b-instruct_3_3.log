2026-01-28 00:00:13,217 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. Extracting interaction terms
<FEATURE_COMPACTNESS_CIRCULARITY><cross><COMPACTNESS><CIRCULARITY><Interaction between compactness and circularity, which may help capture the relationship between these two features>

2. Encoding categorical aspect ratios
<PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><label_encode><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><Encoding the aspect ratio feature as a categorical variable, which may help the model capture non-linear relationships>

3. Scaling variance along axes
<SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><zscore><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><Scaling the variance along the major and minor axes to have zero mean and unit variance, which may help the model learn more robust relationships between these features>

These steps are chosen based on the following reasoning:

* The first step aims to capture the interaction between two features, compactness and circularity, which may help the model learn more complex relationships between these features.
* The second step encodes the aspect ratio feature as a categorical variable, which may help the model capture non-linear relationships between this feature and other numerical features.
* The third step scales the variance along the major and minor axes to have zero mean and unit variance, which may help the model learn more robust relationships between these features and other numerical features.

  <FEATURE_TARGET_ASPECT_RATIO><target_encoding><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><This target encoding operation may help reduce the correlation between the aspect ratio feature and the target variable, which could improve the model's performance and interpretability.>

  ~~~~FUNCTION~~~~
<FEATURE_TARGET_ASPECT_RATIO><target_encoding><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO>

These operations aim to capture different relationships between the given features and create new features that might be valuable for the downstream task. The reasoning behind these steps is to explore different interactions and transformations that could help improve the model's performance. 

It is worth noting that these are just possible next steps, and the actual effectiveness of these features depends on the specifics of the data and the model. Further exploration and experimentation would be needed to determine the most useful new features.

1. <FEATURE_VARIANCE_CIRCULARITY><cross><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><CIRCULARITY> 
This interaction may help capture the relationship between the shape's variance and circularity, which could be important for distinguishing between different vehicle types. 

2. <FEATURE_CIRCULARITY_CONTRAST><minus><CIRCULARITY><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS> 
The difference between circularity and kurtosis about the minor axis may help to distinguish between vehicle types with different shapes and designs.

3. <FEATURE_SCALES_RATIO><div><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS> 
The ratio of variance along the minor and major axes may help to capture the difference in shape between vehicles, which could be useful for classification.

2026-01-28 00:00:28,688 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that can improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Interactions between SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS and SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS
<FEATURE_VAR_RATIO><cross><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><Interaction between the variance along major and minor axes, which can help capture complex relationships in the shape's distribution.>

I chose these operations based on the following reasoning:

* The first step, intersection between variance features, can help capture complex relationships between the shape's distribution in both major and minor axes, which can be beneficial for distinguishing between different vehicle types.
* The second step, ranking compactness, can help identify the subpopulation with the largest or smallest compactness values, which might be indicative of specific vehicle types.
* The third step, target encoding of the aspect ratio feature, can help reduce the correlation between the aspect ratio feature and the target variable, which can improve the model's performance and interpretability.

2026-01-28 00:00:47,822 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. 
<FEATURE_VOLUME_RATIO><cross><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><This interaction may help capture the relationship between the shape's aspect ratio and variance along the minor axis, which can be indicative of vehicle type.>

The reasoning is that the ratio of the aspect ratio to the variance along the minor axis may provide additional information about the shape that can help distinguish between different vehicle types. This interaction may be particularly useful for capturing the complex relationships between these two features.

2. 
<FEATURE_SKEWNESS_COMPACTNESS><cross><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><COMPACTNESS><This interaction can help capture the relationship between compactness and skewness about the minor axis, which may be relevant to the vehicle shape.>

The reasoning is that the interaction between compactness and skewness about the minor axis may provide a better understanding of the shape's characteristics. By considering both features together, we can gain insights into the relationship between the shape's compactness and its degree of asymmetry.

3. 
<FEATURE_KURTOSIS_COMPACTNESS><cross><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><COMPACTNESS><This interaction can help capture the relationship between compactness and kurtosis about the minor axis, which may be indicative of specific vehicle types.>

The reasoning is that the interaction between compactness and kurtosis about the minor axis may provide additional information about the shape's characteristics. By considering both features together, we can identify patterns that may be specific to certain vehicle types.

2026-01-28 00:00:57,247 - INFO - LLM Output: After analyzing the given features, I've identified three potential next steps for generating new features that could improve the downstream model's performance. Here are my suggestions:

1. <FEATURE_COMPACTNESS_COMPACTNESS_CIRCLE><cross><COMPACTNESS><CIRCULARITY>: This feature combines the compactness and circularity of the shape, which could help capture the relationship between these two features that are relevant to the vehicle shape. Compactness measures how closely packed the shape is, while circularity measures how close the shape approaches a perfect circle. By combining these two features, we may be able to identify patterns that are indicative of specific vehicle types.
2. <FEATURE_KURTOSIS_RBOOST><cross><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS>: This feature takes the kurtosis about the major axis and squares it, which can help capture the degree of peakedness or flatness of the shape's distribution. By combining this with the variance along the major axis, we may be able to identify patterns that are indicative of specific vehicle types.
3. <FEATURE_PRAXISCUBE><cross><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><The cube of the PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO feature can help to introduce a non-linear relationship between this feature and the target variable, potentially improving the model's ability to capture interactions between this feature and others.>

The reasoning behind these steps is to combine features in ways that capture the relationships between them, to introduce non-linear relationships, and to reduce correlations between features and the target variable. These operations can help improve the model's ability to identify patterns that are indicative of specific vehicle types.
