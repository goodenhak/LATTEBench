2026-01-27 22:23:57,024 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the available features, I propose the following three next steps to generate additional features:

1. <DebtRatio>cross<Married,BankCustomer>: This feature will calculate the proportion of people who have both a bank account and are married. By creating this interaction term, we can capture the potential effect of having a bank account in combination with being married on creditworthiness.
2. <CreditScore_cosine>CreditScore,Industry>: This feature will calculate the cosine similarity between the credit score and industry categories. The idea is that certain industries may have different credit score profiles, and this feature can help capture these patterns.
3. <YearsEmployed_bins>Income>: This feature will bin the years employed variable into groups (e.g., 0-2, 2-5, 5-10, etc.) and then map each group to a numerical value based on the corresponding median income for that group. This can help capture the relationship between employment duration and income in a more nuanced way.

The reasoning behind these steps is to:

* Explore interaction effects between variables (DebtRatio)
* Use dimensionality reduction or pattern recognition to identify relationships between categorical and numerical features (CreditScore_cosine)
* Employ a non-linear transformation of a numerical feature with a categorical variable to reveal potential patterns (YearsEmployed_bins)

2026-01-27 22:24:04,271 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and the goal of predicting credit card application success, I'll propose three possible next steps for feature engineering:

1. Age_Cube_Age<(number of years employed)
This feature combines the age of the individual with their number of years employed to create a new numerical feature that could capture the effect of age and employment experience on creditworthiness. This interaction might be particularly useful for credit scoring models.

2. Citizenship_Sigmoid_CreditScore>Prediction success
This feature uses the sigmoid function to combine the citizenship status with the individual's credit score. The sigmoid function maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1, which could help in quantifying the relationship between citizenship and creditworthiness.

3. YearsEmployed_Zscore_Industry> 
This feature standardizes the years employed for each industry category to facilitate comparisons across different sectors. This may be particularly useful because employment history can differ significantly depending on the industry, and standardizing these values can help in predicting loan success by accounting for industry-specific employment patterns.

These features aim to capture complex relationships between numerical and categorical variables, reduce bias in the data, and introduce new, potentially useful information to the existing features.

2026-01-27 22:24:24,123 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Encode categorical feature Industry using label encoding and concatenate with CreditScore
IndustryLabelEncode<concat>Industry<CreditScore>Industry Credit Score Ratios by Industry

This feature may help the model capture the relationship between industry and credit score. By using label encoding for Industry, we can transform categorical values into numerical values that the model can understand. Then, concatenating these encoded values with CreditScore may provide a more nuanced understanding of how credit scores vary across different industries.

2. Create income-to-debt ratio using multiply and divide
IncomeToDebtRatio<multiply_Income><divide><Income><Debt>Debt Burden as a Proportion of Income

This feature may help the model understand the relationship between income and debt. By creating a ratio of income to debt, we can see how much of a person's income goes towards debt repayment, which may be a crucial factor in predicting credit card approval.

3. Extract time-based feature using extract_time and multiply with Age
YearsEmployedAsProportionOfAge<extract_time>YearsEmployed<multiply><Age>Proportion of Working Life Employed

This feature may help the model understand the relationship between years employed and age. By extracting the number of years employed and multiplying it with Age, we can create a feature that represents the proportion of working life that a person has spent employed, which may be relevant to credit card approval.

Note that these features are just suggestions, and their performance should be evaluated using metrics such as A/B testing or feature importance analysis to determine their usefulness in the downstream model.

2026-01-27 22:24:31,286 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Age(square)<&>square,Age,New Age as Square Relationship
This step uses the square operator to create a new feature that represents the square of the Age feature. The reasoning behind this is that age squared can provide a non-linear relationship with the target variable (successful in applying for a credit card), which can be useful for capturing more complex interactions in the data.

2. (Married,cross,Employed)<&>cross,Married,Employed,Married-Employed Interaction
This step uses the cross operator to create a new feature that represents the interaction between Married and Employed. The reasoning behind this is that the relationship between being married and employed can be complex, and this new feature can help capture the nuances of this interaction.

3. (Industry,one_hot)>exp>IndustryENone_hot,Industry,Industry Exponential encoding
This step uses the one_hot operator to encode the Industry categorical feature into a one-hot representation, and then applies the exp operator to this encoded feature. The reasoning behind this is that this can help transform the one-hot encoding into a more suitable representation for the model, especially when the number of categories is large.

2026-01-27 22:25:12,824 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <Age>bin<Debt><Age_Binned_by_Debt modelo>'
	* This new feature encodes the degrees of Age using the bin operator based on the level of Debt. For example, if someone's debt is very low (e.g., 0-2), they are likely young, so they would be binned into a low age group < 25. If their debt is moderate (3-10), they would be binned between 25-45. If their debt is high (11+), they would be binned as old, > 45.
2. <CreditScore>squareуютсяат<Income><CreditScore_Squared_by_Income>'
	* This new feature takes the CreditScore and squares it, then combines this with the Income feature. This might help the model understand how CreditScore interacts with Income in terms of predicting creditworthiness.
3. <Employed>target_encoding<Industry><Employed_Encoded_by_Industry>'
	* This new feature uses the target_encoding operator to encode the Employed feature based on the categories in the Industry field. For example, the model might learn that people in the Financials industry who are employed are particularly creditworthy, so it would give them a high target encoding.

2026-01-27 22:25:18,395 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations listed:

1. <AgeLabel_encode>industry<new feature that categorizes age into broad age groups and encodes industry into a numerical value>
2. <married Gumbythenmean>Industry<new feature that calculates the average industry value for each married group>
3. <creditScore square>age<new feature that squares the credit score and multiplies it by age>

Reasoning behind steps:
1. Encoding categorical features like industry into numerical values can help the model better understand the relationships between numerical features and categorical features. Label_encoding age into broad age groups (e.g., young, middle-aged, old) can also help the model capture the underlying patterns in the age distribution.
2. Using the groupbythenmean operator on Industry for each married group can help expose the underlying patterns in the industry distribution for married individuals, which can be a good feature for the model to learn from.
3. Squaring the credit score and multiplying it by age can create a new feature that captures the interaction between credit score and age, which can be an important factor in assessing creditworthiness.

2026-01-27 22:25:24,103 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given data and acceptation, I'll generate three feature engineering steps to improve model performance. I'll reason behind each step.

1. Interdependence between CreditScore and Debt: It's possible that CreditScore is directly related to Debt. Let's create a new feature that might capture the interdependence between the two features.

<CreditScore_Devel><categorical><CreditScore><Debt>  
This will try to learn if the relationship between CreditScore and Debt is categorical.

2. Employment Status and Years Employed: Let's investigate the relationship between employment status (Employed) and years of employment (YearsEmployed). It might provide useful insights into how stability affects employment.

<Employed_Years_<categorical><Employed><YearsEmployed>  
This new feature would capture the categorical relationship between employed status and the number of years employed.

3. Income and ZipCode: Income is a significant feature, and ZipCode might provide a hint about the local economic conditions. We try to combine these pieces of information to gain further insights.

<Income_ZipCode><cross><Income><ZipCode>  
This feature attempts to reveal if a relationship exists between zip codes and income values.

These features are inspired by domain knowledge and statistical reasoning, aiming to improve the model's generalization and understanding of the underlying relationships, which could potentially lead to a better predictive performance.

2026-01-27 22:25:27,445 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features, I will generate three possible next steps to create new features using the operations, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance.

1. Convert Industry categorical feature to numerically comparable values using the bin operator, ranging from 0 to 1 to represent different industry categories. This will help the model to learn the importance of each industry.

zon <bin> <Industry> Industry_Bin
ranging from 0 to 1

2. Encode Ethnicity categorical feature as a numerical value using the label_encode operator. This will convert the categorical variable into a numeric one, which can be easily interpreted by the model.

ethylene <join> <Ethnicity> Ethnicity_Label_Encoder
this will convert ETHNICITY into a numeric value

3. Compute a ratio of CreditScore to Debt, which can be an indicator of the individual's creditworthiness is stronger than their debt.

creditscore_ratio <ratio> <CreditScore><Debt> Credit_Score_vs_Debt_ Indicator
This will create a new feature representing the credit score as a percentage of debt, which can be useful for credit approval predictions.

Let's discuss the reasoning behind these steps:

* The first step aims to transform categorical data into numerical data, reducing the complexity of the model.
* In the second step, we use label encoding to ensure that the model treats each category as a unique value.
* The third step creates a new feature, potentially capturing the relationship between the individual's credit score and debt, making the prediction task even more insightful.

Please let me know if these suggestions align with your expectations or if there's anything else I can help you with!

2026-01-27 22:25:32,759 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features, I'll suggest three possible next steps to generate features to improve the downstream model's performance. Here are my suggestions:

1. <YearsEmployed	Employed	YearsEmployed,skewness	YearsEmployed skewness feature to capture the unequal spread of data

The relation between years employed and employed status is not immediately clear from the data, but the skewness of years employed might provide more insight into the correlation. The YearsEmployed Suk parameter captures how much data is skewed.

2. <Debt	Age	Debt, age by debt quartile <Debt group by age, a proxy for credit maturity and credit responsibility

Debt can be linked to age, as older people typically pay off more debt or accumulate less of it. We can bin age by debt to get better insights into the relationship.

3. <Industry	YearsEmployed	Industry,frequency by employment	Industry frequency of employment feature

Industry might be related to employment in the sense that certain industries may have longer or shorter employment durations. This feature can highlight this correlation.

These features seem promising because they can offer new insights into relationships between features and the target variable. They don't use division, addition, or subtraction with categorical variables, and they adhere to the specified format.
