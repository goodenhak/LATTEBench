2026-01-27 22:45:43,775 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Credit Amount and Duration Relationship
   <credit_amount><bin><duration><a feature that captures the relationship between credit amount and duration, which can be useful for understanding why certain credit amounts are approved for certain durations>

   Reasoning: The approved credit amount often depends on the customer's financial situation, which can be linked to both credit amount and duration. Binning these two features can help in identifying relationships that may not be immediately apparent.

   Code: <credit_amount><bin><duration><new_feature_name>quantiles_credit_duration<new_feature_description>Estimated probability of credit approval based on credit amount and duration

2. Credit History and Employee Status Interaction
   <credit_history><cross><employment><a feature that captures the relationship between credit history and employee status in credit approval, which helps in nuanced decision-making>

   Reasoning: Sometimes, credit history can be directly linked to employee status, and the feature created can help in understanding these interactions effectively.

   Code: <credit_history><cross><employment><new_feature_name>credit_employee_interaction<new_feature_description>Interaction between credit history and employee status in predicting credit approval

3. Savings Status and Resident Duration Interaction
   <savings_status><cross><residence_since><a feature that captures the relationship between savings status and resident duration in credit approval>

   Reasoning: This interaction may provide clues about the applicant's finances and their ability to provide security for the loan.

   Code: <savings_status><cross><residence_since><new_feature_name>credit_residence_savings<new_feature_description>Interaction between savings status and resident duration in predicting credit approval

2026-01-27 22:46:27,303 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and the goal of predicting whether a person receives a credit, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Extract relationships between checking status and credit history

Create a new feature by converting the categorical checking_status feature into a numerical label using label encoding, and then use the cosine operator to calculate the similarity between the encoded checking_status and credit_history features.

<checking_status_encoded><cosine><checking_status,credit_history> Checking status - credit history similarity

2. Quantify credit amount and age

Create a new feature by binning the numerical credit_amount feature into three categories (<1000, 1000-2000, >2000) using the bin operator, and then use the square operator to calculate the squared credit_amount values. Additionally, use the bin operator to bin the numerical age feature into three categories (<30, 30-40, >40).

<credit_amount_bins><square><credit_amount> Squared credit amount bins
<age_bins><bin><age> Age bins

3. Capture differences in employment status and job type

Create a new feature by using the lag operator to calculate the difference between the current employment status and the previous employment status. Then, use the cross operator to combine the categorical job feature with the employment status difference feature.

<employment_lag><lag><employment> Employment status change
<job_cross_employment><cross><job,employment_lag> Job and employment status change

These next steps aim to capture relationships between related features, quantify numerical features, and capture differences between categorical features, which can potentially improve the downstream model's performance.

2026-01-27 22:46:33,947 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. checking_status_encoded<one_hot><checking_status>(Encode checking status into multiple binary features)
The reasoning behind this step is that the original encoding for this feature is categorical and numerical values. By one-hot encoding this feature, we can convert it into more interpretable and easier-to-work-with numerical representation. This can potentially improve the model's ability to capture the relationships between checking status and other features.

2. credit_amount_squared<square><credit_amount>(Calculate the square of credit amount)
The reasoning behind this step is that the non-linear relationship between credit amount and other features might be better captured by including the squared credit amount. This can help the model to learn more complex interactions between features.

3. employment_reference<concat><age><employment>(Merge age and employment status by concatenating them into a new feature)
The reasoning behind this step is that age and employment status might be closely related and can be captured together by concatenating their values. This can create a new feature that is potentially more informative than the individual features. For example, being a young individual with a long employment history might be a distinct characteristic that is not captured by individual age or employment status alone.

These are just a few suggestions, and the actual best approach may depend on the specifics of the dataset and the model being used.

2026-01-27 22:46:45,744 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features provided, here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the operators:

1. <prev_loan_status_leq kidnapped><greater><existing_credits><checking_status>The feature prev_loan_status_leq_kidnapped captures the idea that having fewer existing credits may indicate better credit history, and we want to create a new feature that reflects the combined effect of these two variables. The greater operator returns 1 if the value of existing crédits is greater than the value of checking_status, indicating that the individual has a better credit history.
2. <credit_amount<integer><categorical></property_magnitude>The credit_amount<integer> feature converts the credit amount into an integer, and then we apply the label_encode operator to the categorical feature property_magnitude. This can help to capture non-linear relationships between credit amount and property magnitude.
3. <installation_commitment_bin<acrosstarget><checking_status>The installation_commitment_bin feature captures the category-based distribution of installation commitment based on checking status. Then we create a new feature <installation_commitment_bin<across>target> by applying the 'across' operator on the binarized installation commitment feature with respect to the target feature 'target' (0 if the loan is not approved, 1 if the loan is approved). This can help to model the interaction between the two features and improve the model's performance.

2026-01-27 22:46:59,843 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features for improving the downstream model's performance:

1. <employment_range><cross><checking_status><employment> employment_status_range: This new feature captures the range of employment status within the given checking status. The idea is that individuals with certain employment statuses (e.g., long-term employed or unemployed) may be more likely to receive credit. By incorporating this interaction term, the model may learn to capture non-linear relationships between employment status and checking status.

2. <savings_status><bin><credit_amount> savings_amount_bins: This new feature categorizes the credit amount into bins based on the savings status. For example, individuals with savings status '<100' might have lower credit amounts (<1000), while those with savings status '>=1000' might have higher credit amounts (>10000).

3. <age><minmax><duration> age_duration_range: This new feature calculates the minimum and maximum values of age and duration. The idea is that individuals with shorter durations and younger ages may have less credit history and be more likely to default, while those with longer durations and older ages may have more established credit history and be less likely to default.

Note: These are just a few possible feature engineering ideas, and the best approach will depend on the specific dataset and modeling objective. The goal is to create new features that capture relevant interactions and relationships within the data, which can help improve the model's performance.

2026-01-27 22:47:16,743 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and task, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the listed operations:

1. <credit_amount>_bin_<savings_status> - <categorical_feature_bin><numerical_feature><categorical_feature> - This new feature uses the bin operator to create a categorical feature from the savings_status column, then combines it with the credit_amount column to create a new feature that captures the interaction between savings_status and credit_amount.
2. <duration>_sqrt_<installment_commitment> - <numerical_feature><operator>iterical_feature><numerical_feature> - This new feature uses the sqrt operator to square root the duration column, then combines it with the installment_commitment column to create a new feature that captures the interaction between duration and installment_commitment. This could help the model understand how the duration affects the installment commitment.
3. <credit_history>_one_hot_<purpose> - <categorical_feature_one_hot><categorical_feature> - This new feature uses the one_hot operator to create a new categorical feature from the credit_history column, then combines it with the purpose column to create a new feature that captures the interaction between credit_history and purpose. This could help the model understand the relationship between credit history and purpose of the credit.

Here are the detailed steps:

1. <credit_amount>_bin_<savings_status>

    * First, apply the bin operator to the savings_status column to create a new binary categorical feature.
    * Second, combine the resulting categorical feature with the credit_amount column using the cross operator.

    New feature name: credit_amount_bin_savings_status
    Operator: cross
    Feature 1: credit_amount
    Feature 2: savings_status
    New feature description: A binary categorical feature that captures the interaction between credit_amount and savings_status

2. <duration>_sqrt_<installment_commitment>

    * First, square root the duration column using the sqrt operator.
    * Second, combine the resulting numerical feature with the installment_commitment column using the cross operator.

    New feature name: duration_sqrt_installment_commitment
    Operator: cross
    Feature 1: duration
    Feature 2: installment_commitment
    New feature description: A numerical feature that captures the interaction between duration and installment_commitment after applying square root to duration

3. <credit_history>_one_hot_<purpose>

    * First, apply the one_hot operator to the credit_history column to create new categorical features for each category.
    * Second, combine the resulting categorical feature with the purpose column using the concat operator.

    New feature name: credit_history_one_hot_purpose
    Operator: concat
    Feature 1: credit_history
    Feature 2: purpose
    New feature description: A categorical feature that captures the interaction between credit_history and purpose

2026-01-27 22:47:24,898 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features provided and the task of predicting whether a person receives a credit or not, here are three possible next steps to generate features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <duration_checker_status_rating>cross<checking_status>duration< Compute a cross feature between checking account status and duration to create a new rating feature    
    The duration of the checking account is closely related to the borrower's financial stability and the status of the checking account. Therefore, combining these features could provide valuable information about the borrower's reliability.

2. <personal_status_employment_status>bin<employment><personal_status< Create a binned feature of employment status based on the personal status, to capture the relationship between employment status and personal situation    
    Personal status and employment status are related but not directly correlated. By binning the employment status based on the personal status, we can capture the nuances of the relationship between these two features, potentially improving the model's ability to distinguish between different types of borrowers.

3. <credit_amount_savings_status_ratio>log<credit_amount>savings_status< Compute a logarithmic ratio of credit amount to savings status to capture the relationship between credit demand and savings    
    The relationship between credit demand and savings is not straightforward. By taking the logarithm of the ratio of credit amount to savings status, we can capture the underlying dynamics of this relationship in a more meaningful way, potentially improving the model's ability to identify borrowers with high credit demand relative to their savings.

Note that these steps are based on the assumption that the features are being used as input for a binary classification problem, and that we are looking to generate new features to improve the performance of the model. The choice of operator and feature combinations is based on the relationships and correlations between the original features.

2026-01-27 22:47:37,207 - INFO - LLM Output: After analyzing the provided data, I've come up with three possible next steps to generate features that may improve the downstream model's performance:

1. checking_status_label_encode<numerical_feature><registered_date>: Convert the categorical 'checking_status' feature into a numerical encoded label, and then multiply it with the 'duration' feature. This may help capture the interaction between the account status and the length of time the customer has had the account.
2. <employment>cross<age>: Use the cross-function to combine the categorical 'employment' feature with the 'age' feature. This may help capture the relationship between employment status and age, which could be relevant for creditworthiness.
3. savings_status_bin<credit_amount>: Convert the categorical 'savings_status' feature into a numerical bin, and then divide the result by the 'credit_amount' feature. This may help capture the relationship between savings status and credit amount, which could be relevant for creditworthiness.

These features are designed to capture interactions between different variables and to provide more nuanced information about the data.

<new_feature_name>cross<credit_amount><savings_status><interaction_feature_description>

Reasoning: We know that credit_amount and savings_status are both related to the applicant's financial situation. By taking the cross product of these two features, we can create a new feature that captures the interaction between them. This may help the model learn non-linear relationships between the two features.

2. Transforming employment and duration
python
<new_feature_name>log<employment><log_duration><transformed_feature_description>

Reasoning: The employment feature is categorical, but the duration feature is numerical. By applying the log operator to both features, we can transform them into similar scales. This may help the model learn relationships between the two features more easily.

3. Target encoding for credit_history
python
<new_feature_name>target_encoding<credit_history><credit_amount><encoded_feature_description>

Reasoning: The credit_history feature is categorical, but we know that credit_amount is a strong predictor of the target variable. By target encoding the credit_history feature using the credit_amount feature, we can create a new feature that captures the relationship between the two. This may help the model learn how to predict credit more accurately.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other possible next steps we could take. Do you want me to generate more?
