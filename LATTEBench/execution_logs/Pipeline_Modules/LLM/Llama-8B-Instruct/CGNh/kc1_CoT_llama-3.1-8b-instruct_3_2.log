2026-01-27 23:07:05,693 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <branchCount>groupbythenstd<loc><branchCount>standard deviation of loc across modules with similar branch count
This feature combines the branch count with the line count (loc) to capture the variance in module complexity across modules with similar branch count. The groupbythenstd operator calculates the standard deviation of loc across these groups.

2. <uniq_Op>label_encode<defect_status>one-hot encoding of unique operators across modules with different defect status
This feature uses the label_encode operator to convert the categorical defect status into a numerical representation, and then combines it with the unique operators (uniq_Op) to capture the difference in module complexity across modules with different defect status.

3. <l>bin<e>upper quartile of effort (e) for modules with high program length (l)
This feature uses the bin operator to categorize the effort (e) into four bins based on its value, and then combines it with the program length (l) to capture the relationship between module complexity and effort for modules with high program length. The upper quartile of effort (e) is calculated for these groups.

These features are designed to capture different aspects of module complexity and relationship with effort and defect status, which can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model.

2026-01-27 23:07:20,869 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and data, here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Feature transformation for McCabe's line count of code (loc) and Halstead's effort (e)

Create a new feature that captures the logarithmic relationship between loc and e:

<>log західfeature loc&e Logarithmic relationship between volume and effort. Helps capture non-linear patterns.

2. Capturing interactions between unique operators (uniq_Op) and essential complexity (ev(g))

Apply a binary encoding on uniq_Op and then use the cross operator to capture interactions with ev(g):

<> cross bin uniq_op&ev(g) Interaction between unique operator density and essential complexity. Helps capture complex relationships between code characteristics.

3. Abbreviating the impact of cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) on other features

Use the bin operator to categorize v(g) into distinct levels (e.g., [1, 3], [3, 6], [6, 10]) and then create a new feature that captures the relative contribution of v(g) to other features:

<> label_encode v(g)&loc Label encoding of cyclomatic complexity helps in clustering similar code characteristics. The feature captures the relative importance of cyclomatic complexity in shaping the code's structure.

Let me know if you'd like me to generate more feature combinations!

2026-01-27 23:07:44,953 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. Calculate the similarity between essential complexity (ev(g)) and cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) using the cosine similarity operator:

<ev_similarity><cosine><ev(g)><v(g)> Compare the similarity between the essential complexity and cyclomatic complexity.

This feature is generated by applying the cosine similarity operator to the essential complexity feature (ev(g)) and the cyclomatic complexity feature (v(g)). This allows us to capture the relationship between these two complexity measures.

2. Calculate the ratio of Halstead's line count (lOCode) to the count of lines of comments (lOComment) using the divide operator:

<lOCode Comment_ratio><divide><lOCode><lOComment> Measure the ratio of code lines to comment lines.

This feature is generated by dividing the Halstead's line count (lOCode) by the count of lines of comments (lOComment). This ratio can be an indicator of the code's maintainability and understandability.

3. Encode the McCabe's line count of code (loc) using the label_encode operator and group by the Halstead's line count (lOCode):

<loc_encode><label_encode><groupbythenmean><loc><lOCode> Encode the McCabe's line count and group by Halstead's line count to capture the relationship between these two features.

This feature is generated by encoding the McCabe's line count of code (loc) using the label_encode operator and grouping the result by the Halstead's line count (lOCode). This allows us to capture the relationship between these two features.

<ev encounters><cross><ev(g)><locCode>
This new feature combines the mean number of cyclomatic complexity (ev(g)) with the count of source lines of code (locCode). This could indicate the average complexity per line of code.

Step 2: 
<ev(g)><exp><ev_detail>
This measure aims to scale up the Halstead's essential complexity (ev(g)) by exponentiation, which could make the high values less dominant and more symmetrical in distribution.

Step 3: 
<locCode><square><locCodeAndComment>
This New feature creates an additional insight by multiplying if the halstead's count of lines of code by its squared value, emphasizing the points that the count of lines and comments has an equal importance in the software.

2026-01-27 23:08:01,286 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and instructions, here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <ev_similarityscale><sqrt><ev(g)><v(g)>|<lOComment_percent><label_encode><lOCode><new_feature_description: exploring the relationship between essential complexity and cyclomatic complexity at different line comment percentages>


Explanation: This feature combines the cube operator with the sqrt operator to scale the ev similarity metric, and then takes the absolute value of the result after multiplying it with the quotient of lOComment and lOCode. This will help to capture the relationship between the software's essential complexity and cyclomatic complexity at different line comment percentages.


2. <ev_similarity><cosine><ev(g)><v(g)>|<uniq_Op><label_encode><locCodeAndComment><new_feature_description: exploring the similarity between essential and cyclomatic complexity in relation to the number of unique operators and lines of code combined>


Explanation: This feature combines the cosine operator with the negation operator to calculate the similarity between the ev(g) and v(g) features, and then multiplies it by the bucketed value of uniq_Op using bin and takes the quotient of locCodeAndComment. This will help to capture the similarity between the ev(g) and v(g) features when taking into account the number of unique operators and the lines of code combined.


3. <egalotypelabel_encode><locCodeAndComment><new_feature_description: creating a boolean indicator for the presence of nonzero comments and non-zero lines>


Explanation: This feature uses the type conversion through multiplying the eq operator with label_encode to create a new feature that takes the value 1 when both the locCodeAndComment are zero and 0 otherwise. This will create a new feature that captures whether there are nonzero comments and non-zero lines of code in the software.

1. Calculating the Ratio of McCabe's Line Count to Halstead's Effort

<ev_effort_ratio><cross><loc><e> 
This new feature measures the ratio of McCabe's line count (loc) to Halstead's effort (e). This could provide insight into how efficiently the code is written, based on these two metrics.

2. Similarity Between McCabe's Essential Complexity and Cyclomatic Complexity

<ev_vg_similarity><cosine><ev(g)><v(g)> 
This new feature calculates the cosine similarity between McCabe's essential complexity (ev(g)) and cyclomatic complexity (v(g)). This could help identify code patterns with similar complexities.

3. Percentage of Lines of Code that are Comments

<locode_comment_percent><label_encode><lOCode><lOComment> 
This new feature calculates the percentage of lines of code (lOCode) that are comments (lOComment). This could provide insight into the code's documentation quality and whether it relates to defects.

Reasoning: 
The first step aims to understand how efficiently the code is written in terms of McCabe's line count and Halstead's effort. The second step explores the relationship between McCabe's essential complexity and cyclomatic complexity. This might help identify code patterns with similar complexities. The third step examines the proportion of lines of code that are comments, which might relate to code quality and defects.

2026-01-27 23:08:09,616 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Extract Time Complexity: Analyzing the relationship between the Halstead 'effort' and McCabe 'essential complexity'.

<effort_complexity><sqrt><e><ev(g)>|<e)x|(McCabe's essential complexity)

This feature combines the numerical effort measure with the essential complexity, applying the square root operator to capture non-linear relationships. The new feature effort_complexity could capture the underlying complex relationships influencing software defect prediction.

2. Comment Density: Investigating the correlation between lines of comments and Halstead's line count.

<comment_density><cross><lOComment><lOCode>|<(lines of comments in relation to programming )

This feature uses the cross operator to calculate the ratio of lines of comments to lines of code. This ratio can provide insights into the commenting style and software maintainability.

3. Complexity Variance: Analyzing the dispersion of McCabe's cyclomatic complexity.

<complexity_variance><stddev><v(g)><loc>|<(dispersion of cyclomatic complexity)

This feature applies the standard deviation operator to calculate the dispersion of McCabe's cyclomatic complexity. This new feature can help capture how consistent the complexity measure in different modules is, potentially revealing underlying patterns in software quality.

2026-01-27 23:08:27,016 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. Calculating Similarity between McCabe and Halstead Complexity Metrics
bash
<ev_vg_similarity><cosine><ev(g)><v(g)>|<locode_comment_percent><label_encode><lOCode>

Reasoning: The Halstead and McCabe complexity metrics are both widely used in software metrics. Calculating the similarity between these two metrics using the cosine similarity operator can provide valuable insights into the relationship between the two. This feature can help capture the nuances of code complexity that are not apparent from individual metrics.

2. Transforming Effort Metric using Logarithm
bash
<effort_complexity><log><e><ev(g)>

Reasoning: The effort metric (e) is highly skewed, with many values concentrated at the lower end of the range. Taking the logarithm of this metric can help to reduce the impact of outliers and make the distribution more normal. This can lead to improved model performance, especially when using metrics that are sensitive to the distribution of the data.

3. Creating a Comment-to-Code Ratio Feature
bash
<comment_to_code_ratio><concat><lOComment_percent><lOCode>

Reasoning: This feature combines the percentage of comments in the code (lOComment_percent) with the total number of lines of code (lOCode) to create a comment-to-code ratio. This can provide insights into the balance between code and comments, which can be useful in evaluating code quality and maintainability.
