2026-01-27 22:51:14,100 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. new_feature_life_insurance_<checking_status><label_encode><property_magnitude><Categorical feature representing life insurance status based on property_magnitude>
This feature combines the categorical property_magnitude with the existing categorical checking_status. This could be beneficial for capturing relationships between the property_magnitude and life insurance.

2. new_feature_credit_dur_bin<credit_history><duration><Numerical feature representing a bin of credit duration based on credit history>
This feature transforms the categorical credit_history into bins of duration, allowing the model to learn relationships between credit history and duration.

3. new_feature_age_num_rank<age><rank><numerical_feature representing the rank of age in the data>
This feature transforms the numerical age feature into its rank in the dataset, which could help the model learn about the relative position of the individual's age in terms of other data points.

Note: Each of these new features can potentially improve the downstream model's performance by adding more context and complexity to the input data. The first one combines categorical features and their transformation, the second one uses type conversion, while the third one uses an aggregation operator.

2026-01-27 22:51:22,363 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and target variable, here are three possible next steps to generate features using various operators:

1. Encode categorical variables using label encoding
   Implement the following:
   1. checking_status<Label_Encode>credit_history<Encode_status_history,]['numerical encoding for credit history']
   2. personal_status<Label_Encode>other_parties<Encode_other_parties,]['numerical encoding for other parties']
   3. purpose<Label_Encode>credit_amount<Encode_amount_exact,]['numerical encoding for credit amount']
   
   Reasoning:
   Label encoding is a technique to replace categorical values with numbers. By encoding the categorical variables into numerical values, we can utilize the power of numerical operations. The first feature name is 'checking_status_Ecredit_history_' indicating an encoding feature for credit history. We do the same for other categorical variables.

2. Interaction between continuous variables using multiplication
   1. installment_commitment*age<Years_previous_installment_commitment['installment commitment multiplied by age']
   2. duration*age<Years_previous_duration['duration multiplied by age']
   Reasoning:
   By multiplying continuous variables, we can create new features that capture interactions between them. This can help the model to better understand the relationship between these variables.

3. Edit some continuous variables to reflect better credit risk
   1. sqrt(duration)<Duration_previous_standardized['sqrt of duration', for feature description]
   Reasoning:
   The sqrt operation can be useful in reducing the effect of outliers and to better understand the data distribution. By taking the square root of duration, we might gain valuable insights into the dependency between the duration and the target variable.

These features should improve the model's performance by adding new interaction and non-linear relationships between variables. In particular, multiplying continuous variables and standardizing them can help the model to better fit non-linear relationships between these continuous variables. Note that feature names should be descriptive, following the given instruction, to keep track of each new feature comfortably. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator contains one feature, while the second parameter will follow suit.

2026-01-27 22:52:11,443 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. Interaction between credit_amount and employment: Group by checked/unchecked status and calculate the mean of credit_amount for each group to understand the distribution of credit amounts based on employment status.

    <mean_credit_amount_by_employment<groupbythenmean> <feature:checking_status> <feature:credit_amount><new_feature: mean credit amount by employment> 
2. Risk assessment using installments and existing_credits: Convert installments to a numerical value (e.g., percentage to a decimal) and calculate the ratio of existing_credits to installments percentage. This feature will help understand the credit risk.

 appId< cross ><feature:installment_commitment><feature:existing_credits><new_feature: credit risk>
3. Age-based categorization of employment: Label encode the employment feature according to age to understand if older or younger individuals are more likely to have certain employment types. This can help identify relationships between age and employment.

<employment_age_category< label_encode ><feature: employment><feature: age><new_feature: employment age category>

These next steps should help address the problem and potentially improve the performance of the downstream model. Let me know if you'd like more options!

2026-01-27 22:52:17,153 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Numerical_to_Categorical_checking_status_checking_status_label_encode << checking_status <new_feature_description: Encoding checking_status as a numerical value>
Reasoning: This step is useful because the model may benefit from having separate numerical values for each categorical value of checking_status, as opposed to having a single numerical value that may not capture the categorical differences.

2. Exists_Other_Parties_bin_other_partiesINSTALLMENT_COMMITMENT <new_feature_description: Indicating if the number of other debtors or guarantors is above or below a certain threshold>
Reasoning: This step is useful because it may help the model capture the relationship between the number of other debtors or guarantors and the credit application outcome. By creating a binary feature indicating whether the number of other parties is above or below a certain threshold, we may be able to detect potential issues with DoğuApprovalmag cage academy Ok])); investigaciónAllen housedone instantly _

3. Savings_Status_sin duration <new_feature_description: Creating a sine wave feature to capture the relationship between savings_status and duration>
Reasoning: This step is useful because it may help the model capture a non-linear relationship between savings_status and duration. The sine function may help to detect patterns in the data that may not be visible with a linear relationship.

2026-01-27 22:52:29,148 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <one_hot><employment><category><one_hot representation of employment categories>: This feature could capture the non-numerical aspects of employment, which might be important for predicting credit approval. The one-hot encoding will create separate columns for each category, allowing the model to learn distinct patterns for each.

2. <abs><credit_amount><abs value of credit amount>: This feature could highlight the absolute value of credit amount, which might be useful for models that are sensitive to the magnitude of credit requests. The absolute value can be particularly important for models that are biased towards certain credit amounts.

3. <groupbythenmean><credit_amount><checking_status><average credit amount for each checking status>: This feature could help capture the relationship between checking status and credit amount. By grouping the data by checking status and taking the mean credit amount for each group, we can create a feature that shows the average credit amount for individuals with a certain checking status. This can be particularly useful for models that want to understand the nuances of credit approval based on checking status.

Here are the specific lines:
1. one_hot_employment_category one_hot employment category one_hot representation of employment categories
2. abs_credit_amount abs credit_amount absolute value of credit amount

2026-01-27 22:52:34,170 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given data, I'm going to suggest three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <checking_status_label_encode> label_encode <checking_status> <Encoded sorting of checking status to enable more accurate modeling>
2. <credit_amount_log> log <credit_amount> <Log transformation of credit amount to reduce skewness>
3. <employment_bin><age> bin <age> <Binning of employment status and age to enable more accurate mapping in the model>

Here's the explanation behind each step:

1. This step involves label encoding the checking_status feature. This is done to transform the categorical checking_status into numerical values, but instead of using its original meaning, we will sort these categories in a way that makes more sense for our model. By ordering the categories based on how desirable they are, this allows sorting variable importance based on this encoding rather than values. For example in this case, >=200, no checking, 0<=X<200, and <0 as 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively based on some business logic could be employed. Then we can include the encoded feature into the model which has been markedly improved compared to the non encoded feature.

2. This step involves taking the log of the credit_amount feature. Taking the logarithm of the credit_amount feature helps in reducing the effect of extreme values, which can be present in this dataset. By reducing the impact of such values, it helps in ensuring that the model does not get misled by outliers.

3. This step involves binning the employment feature along with age. Binning these two features enables more accurate modeling because these two features are often associated with each other. For instance, younger people may have fewer children, and more educated individuals may have higher-paying jobs. By binning both features together, we can create feature combinations that would have been either challenging or impossible to model using individual features.

   We can use the sine function to capture any potential seasonal patterns in the credit amount with respect to the duration of credit. This can help the model identify if there's a correlation between credit amount and duration.

3. <new_feature_3>cross<employment>age<new_feature_3_description: Risk assessment based on employment and age categories>

   The cross operator can help create a binary interaction feature based on employment and age categories. This can provide additional information to the model about how credit risk changes when employment and age categories intersect.

These features were created to capture complex patterns or interactions that may not be represented by the existing features.

2026-01-27 22:52:46,009 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. encoding_duration <- label_encode <- duration
	* Reasoning: The duration feature is numerical, but it may benefit from encoding into categorical variables to enable the model to capture non-linear relationships. Label encoding can be used to replace numerical values with categorical labels.
2. credit_history_friendly <- bin <- credit_amount <- credit_amount
	* Reasoning: The credit amount feature has a skewed distribution, and binning can help to reduce its impact and improve model interpretability. By binning credit amount, we can create a categorical feature that captures the magnitude of credit amount.
3. age_group <- bin <- age <- age
	* Reasoning: Age is a numerical feature, and binning it can help to capture the categorical structure of age groups. This can be useful in capturing relationships between age and other features, such as employment status or credit history.

These new features aim to improve the model's performance by:

* Encoding the duration feature to improve the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships
* Reducing the impact of the skewed credit amount feature through binning
* Capturing the categorical structure of age through binning

Note that the operators used are chosen to avoid dividing or subtracting categorical features, and to use type conversion and grouping as instructed.

I chose these steps because:

*   One-hot encoding employment feature is useful because it can capture the non-linear relationships between employment category and other features.
*   Label encoding personal status feature is useful because it can provide a numerical representation of categorical values which can be used for regression models.
*   Binning employment years into categories can capture non-linear relationships between employment years and other features, which can be useful for capturing trends or patterns that may not be apparent in the original numerical representation of employment years.
