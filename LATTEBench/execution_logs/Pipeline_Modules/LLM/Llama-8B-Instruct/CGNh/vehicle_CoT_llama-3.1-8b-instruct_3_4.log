2026-01-28 00:02:54,303 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Non-linear relationship between COMPACTNESS and CIRCULARITY
<Compactness_Circularity_Logistic_Relationship>log<Compactness><Circularity><Creates a feature that captures the non-linear relationship between compactness and circularity using a logistic function>

Reasoning: The compactness and circularity features seem to be highly correlated, but a logistic function can reveal non-linear relationships that may be useful for the model.

2. Aspect ratio differences between major and minor axes
<Axis_Aspect_Ratio_Difference>minmax<PR.Axis_Aspect_Ratio><SCALED_Variance_Along_Minor_Axis><Highlights the differences in aspect ratios between major and minor axes>

Reasoning: The aspect ratio features (PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO and SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS) are likely to be important for distinguishing between vehicle types. By taking the minimum and maximum values, we can highlight the differences between these two features.

3. Skewness and kurtosis correlation
<Skewness_Kurtosis_Correlation>zscore<SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><Captures the correlation between skewness and kurtosis, which may indicate heavy-tailed distributions>

Reasoning: Skewness and kurtosis are both measures of shape, and they are often related. By calculating the z-score of the skewness and kurtosis features, we can capture the correlation between them, which may indicate heavy-tailed distributions that are common in vehicle silhouettes.

1. hollowness_difference cJSON KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS HOLLOWS_RATIO the new feature measures the difference between the hollows ratio and kurtosis about major axis, which can help identify vehicles with unusual shapes or irregularities.
2. manual_compare sécur categorical_feature COMPACTNESS OPEL if the compactness is higher than a certain threshold, label encode it as 'high'; otherwise, label encode it as 'low', this can help the model distinguish between high and low compactness vehicles
3. ∑_DOMINANT 등록 diff COMPACTNESS MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO cumulative sum of differences between compactness and max length aspect ratio

The reasoning behind these steps are:

* The first step combines the hollows ratio and kurtosis about major axis to capture the aspect of vehicle shape, as vehicles with higher hollows ratio and kurtosis about major axis are likely to have less uniform shapes.
* The second step creates a new categorical feature that categorizes vehicles as high or low compactness, which can help the model identify vehicles that are compact or not. This can improve the model's accuracy in distinguishing between compact and non-compact vehicles.
* The third step computes the cumulative sum of differences between compactness and max length aspect ratio, which can help identify vehicles that have a combination of compactness and length that are not typical. This can improve the model's ability to distinguish between vehicles with unusual size and shape combinations.

1. Averaging aspect ratios

The reason behind this step is that the aspect ratio of a vehicle can provide some information about its shape. By averaging the aspect ratios, we can capture a more stable and robust feature that may be more predictive of the vehicle type. This new feature can help the model learn about the overall shape and structure of the vehicle.

The reason behind this step is that taking the logarithm of the rectangularity of the vehicle's axis can help the model to better understand the spread of this feature, potentially leading to a more accurate classification.

3. Combining features with feature interaction

The reason behind this step is that by combining features, we can create new features that capture the interaction between the original features, which can provide additional information that the model can use to improve its classification accuracy.

These are just three possible next steps to generate new features, and there are many other potential combinations of operations and features that can be used to create new features. The goal is to choose the features that are most useful for the specific downstream task and that provide the most information for the model to learn from.

   <Compactness_Kurtosis_ratio>ratio<COMPACTNESS>KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS> Ratio of COMPACTNESS to KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS

   Reasoning: It's common to compare ratio of numerical features to convey economic and efficiency aspects.

3. Maps HOLLOWS_RATIO to a binary feature based on the condition HOLLOWS_RATIO > 200.

   <Hollows_binned><bin><HOLLOWS_RATIO>100>new feature with HOLLOWS_RATIO mapped into a binary format (equal to 1 if HOLLOWS_RATIO > 200, or 0 otherwise)

   Reasoning: Sometimes, data that lies in multiple categories makes more sense to classify along one selected category that is most significant.

2026-01-28 00:03:36,455 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <>sqrt<COMPACTNESS><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO>< Compactness Plus Square Root of Aspect Ratio>
   Reasoning: We want to create a feature that combines the Compactness of the vehicle with the Square Root of the Aspect Ratio. The square root operation can help to amplify the effect of the aspect ratio, while compactness can provide a more direct measure of the vehicle's shape. This new feature might be useful for models that are trying to distinguish between different types of vehicles.

2. <>minus<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY>< Absolute Difference Between Aspect Ratio and Rectangularity>
   Reasoning: We want to create a feature that captures the difference between the aspect ratio and the rectangularity of the vehicle. This might be useful for models that are trying to understand the interplay between these two features and how they relate to the type of vehicle. By calculating the absolute difference between them, we can create a feature that might help the model to better distinguish between different types of vehicles.

3. <>cross<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>< Interactive Relationship Between Aspect Ratio and Kurtosis>
   Reasoning: We want to create a feature that captures the interactive relationship between the aspect ratio of the vehicle and its kurtosis about the major axis. This feature can provide a more nuanced perspective on how these two shape-related features interact and might be useful for models that are trying to capture the subtleties of vehicle shape. By using the cross operator, we can create a feature that captures the joint effect of these two features on the shape of the vehicle.

2026-01-28 00:03:40,929 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Ratio of Compactness and Max Length Rectangularity
   <MAX.LENGTH_COMPACTNESS_RATIO>ratio<COMPACTNESS><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY>
   This feature can help capture the relationship between compactness and rectangularity, which can be useful for distinguishing between vehicle types.

2. Label Encoding of PR.Axis Aspect Ratio
   <ASPECT_RATIO_ENCODED><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO>
   Categorical features such as the aspect ratio can be useful, but they require label encoding since you can't use them with most operators.  This new feature prepares the data for use with operators like rolling_mean or rolling_min.

3. Z-Score of Kurtosis About Major Axis
   <KURTOSIS_Z_SCORE>zscore<KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>
   By computing the z-score of Kurtosis, we can normalize the feature to a range that better matches the ranges of other features. This normalization may improve the performance of the downstream model by putting all features on the same scale.  This feature is especially useful if Kurtosis is a strong discriminant feature.

1. <MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><cross><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY> Compare rectangularity with aspect ratio

This feature combines the aspect ratio of the major axis with the rectangularity of the silhouette, which could be useful in distinguishing between vehicle types. This is a simple but potentially effective feature that leverages the interplay between different aspects of the silhouette.

2. <PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><label_encode><VAN> Encode PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO with numerical values corresponding to type VAN

This feature uses label encoding to convert the categorical feature VAN into a numerical feature corresponding to its position in the list. This can help the model learn relationships between the numerical features and the categorical outcome. Note: Replace VAN with any categorical feature for this transformation.

3. <MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><diff><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><lag> Calculate difference in MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO over time/angle shifts

This feature calculates the difference in MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO between adjacent time steps or angles, which could be useful in capturing changes in the silhouette over different views. The lag function introduces time/angle shifts, while the diff function calculates the difference.

2026-01-28 00:03:49,243 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next-step feature engineering suggestions to potentially improve the model's performance:

1. OLD.KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS*zscore(MIN.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO): This new feature combines the kurtosis about the major axis with the z-score of the maximum length aspect ratio. The kurtosis feature captures the shape and symmetry of the vehicle, while the z-score of the length aspect ratio could indicate how the vehicle's length is distributed across different aspect ratios. By combining these two, we might capture relationships between the vehicle's shape and its length aspect ratio.

2. HOLLOWS_RATIO*log(MIN.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO): This new feature leverages the relationship between the vessel's hollowness ratio and its length aspect ratio. The log transformation of the length aspect ratio could help to amplify the contrast between vehicles with different length aspect ratios. The hollowness ratio might indicate how empty or hollow the vehicle is, which could be related to its length.

3. PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO*PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY: This new feature combines the aspect ratio of the minor axis with the rectangularity of the same axis. This might help the model capture a property of the vehicle where the major axis is shorter than the minor axis, and the approximation of the minor axis plays a key role in the overall structure of the vehicle.

2026-01-28 00:03:56,359 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators provided:

1. <CORRELATION_MAX_LENGTH_RECTAGULARITY>cross<MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY>KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>Correlation between MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY and KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS
	* This step uses the cross operator to calculate the correlation between two numerical features, MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY and KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS. The idea is that the correlation between these two features may provide useful information for the classification task.
2. <PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO_label_encode>type conversion<PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO>PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO<Encoded feature for PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO>
	* This step uses the label_encode operator to convert the numerical feature PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO into a categorical feature. This is because the original feature PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO may not capture the categorical relationship between the vehicle types. By encoding it as a categorical feature, we may be able to improve the model's performance.
3. <abs.KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>absolute value KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>Absolute value of KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS
	* This step uses the abs operator to calculate the absolute value of the numerical feature KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS. The idea is that the absolute value of a feature may provide a more robust representation of the feature's distribution, and may help to reduce the impact of outliers.
