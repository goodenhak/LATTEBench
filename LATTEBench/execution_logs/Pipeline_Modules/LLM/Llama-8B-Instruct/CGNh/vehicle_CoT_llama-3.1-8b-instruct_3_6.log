2026-01-28 00:13:35,099 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and their characteristics, here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. The current features contain both high and low values, which might not be suitable for all vehicle types. To address this issue, we can use the KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS and KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS features, which indicate the distribution of the vehicle's silhouette. We can create a new feature to measure the symmetry of the vehicle's silhouette by taking the absolute difference between these two features.

 <kurtosis_diff>AbsDifference<KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS> indicates the similarity between the kurtosis of the silhouette along major and minor axes.

2. The vehicle's aspect ratios (PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO, MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO) might be useful for distinguishing between different vehicle types. We can create a new feature that calculates the ratio of these two aspect ratios, which might provide additional information about the vehicle's shape.

 <aspect_ratio_ratio>Ratio<PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO> represents the ratio of the minor axis aspect ratio to the length perpendicular to the maximum length aspect ratio.

3. The circularity and scatter ratio features seem to be highly correlated, so we can create a new feature that measures the difference between these two features. This could help the model distinguish between vehicles with varying shapes.

 <scatter_ratio_diff>Difference<SCATTER_RATIO><CIRCULARITY> calculates the difference between the scatter ratio and the circularity.

These new features can help the model account for the varying characteristics of different vehicle shapes, potentially improving its performance. The reasoning behind these steps is to create features that are complementary to the existing ones and provide additional information that can be useful for distinguishing between different vehicle types.

2026-01-28 00:13:44,492 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Interactions between shape features
sql
<SHAPE_INTERACTION1>cross<COMPACTNESS><ELONGATEDNESS><new_feature_description: Interaction between compactness and elongatedness>
<SHAPE_INTERACTION2>cross<SCATTER_RATIO><HOLLOWS_RATIO><new_feature_description: Interaction between scatter ratio and hollows ratio>

This step uses the cross operator to create new features that are a combination of various shape features. The idea is that these interactions might capture complex relationships between the features that are not apparent when looking at them individually.

2. Transformations of skewness and kurtosis features
sql
<SKWEENE164_UBRAS領ypFeature><sqrt><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><new_feature_description: Square root of skewness about major axis>
<KURTOgre86733 predomin distressed14770628722DB75LEferor[MAXN_SHIEv celluluse<cube><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS>><new_feature_description: Cubed kurtosis about major axis>

This step uses various mathematical operators (e.g., square root, cube) to transform the skewness and kurtosis features, which are powerful statistics that can help capture the shape of the feature distribution.

3. Relative distances between shape features
sql
<RELATIVE_DISTANCE1><divide><DISTANCE_CIRCULARITY><ELONGATEDNESS><new_feature_description: Relative distance between distance circularity and elongatedness>
<RELATIVE_DISTANCE2><divide><RADIUS_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><new_feature_description: Relative distance between radius ratio and max length aspect ratio>

This step uses the divide operator to calculate the relative distances between different shape features, which can help provide context for how these features relate to each other.

Note that these are just a few possible next steps, and there are many other OPERATORS and features to explore. Also, some of these features might be redundant or irrelevant, and more investigation may be needed to determine which features are most useful for the downstream model.

2026-01-28 00:13:52,930 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. <HOLLOWS_RATIO_BINNER><bin><HOLLOWS_RATIO><new_feature_description: Binned hollows ratio>

This step converts the numerical feature HOLLOWS_RATIO into a categorical feature by binning it. This can help the model capture non-linear relationships between the feature and the target variable. By converting HOLLOWS_RATIO into a categorical feature, we can also reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and improve the model's interpretability.

2. <SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS_RANKER><rank><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><new_feature_description: Ranked scaled variance along minor axis> 

This step ranks the SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS feature in descending order. Ranking can help capture the relative importance of the feature within the model and provide additional insights into the problem. It can be particularly useful for features with large standard deviations to reduce their effect.

3. <ELONGATEDNESS_CROSSENERGY><cross><ELONGATEDNESS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><new_feature_description: Cross-pair of elongatedness and scaled variance along minor axis>

This step computes the cross-energy of the ELONGATEDNESS and SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS features. Cross-energy is a measure of the correlation between two features, and it can help identify complex relationships between the features. By incorporating the cross-energy into the feature space, we can provide more information to the model and potentially improve its performance. 

Note: These steps are just suggestions, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to feature engineering. It's essential to experiment with different features and operators to find what works best for your specific problem and dataset.

2026-01-28 00:13:58,877 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. <HOLLOWS_RATIO_label_encode><categorical_feature,HOLLOWS_RATIO><new_feature_description: Label-encoding hollows ratio for categorical classification>
This step involves label-encoding the HOLLOWS_RATIO feature, which could help the model capture the categorical relationships between the different buckets of hollows ratio.

2. <abs><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><new_feature_description: Absolute scaled variance along major axis>
This step involves taking the absolute value of the scaled variance along major axis, which could help to reduce the impact of negative values and provide a more consistent representation of the data.

3. <numeric><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS_bin><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><new_feature_description: Binned scaled variance along minor axis>
This step involves binning the scaled variance along minor axis, which could help to reduce the dimensionality of the data and potentially improve the model's ability to capture the underlying patterns.

The reasoning behind these steps is to explore different ways to transform and manipulate the existing features to create new features that are more informative and useful for the downstream classification task. By applying various operators and transformations, we can create new features that capture different aspects of the data, such as categorical relationships, absolute values, and binned distributions, which can help to improve the model's performance.

2026-01-28 00:14:04,918 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. <RELATIVE_SCAL_RATIOS><cross><SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><new_feature_description: Cross-pair of scaled radius of gyration and skewness about major axis>
This feature combines the scaled radius of gyration and skewness about major axis, which are both measures of a vehicle's shape. By taking the cross-product of these two features, we may capture interactions between them that can provide additional information for the model.

2. <LABEL_ENCODED_HOLLOWS_RATIO><one_hot><HOLLOWS_RATIO><new_feature_description: One-hot encoded hollows ratio>
This feature converts the categorical-like continuous hollows ratio into a binary vector, allowing the model to learn independent weights for each category. This can be particularly useful if the hollows ratio is not necessarily a linear relationship with the target variable.

3. <BINARY_RELATIVESCATTER_RATIO><bin><RELATIVE_SCATTER_RATIO><MODE><new_feature_description: Binned relative scatter ratio>
This feature takes the RELATIVE SCATTER RATIO calculated in step 1 and bin it into categories. This can help the model learn the specifics of the distribution of scatter ratio in each category, which can be particularly useful if the scatter ratio is not a linear relationship with the target variable.
