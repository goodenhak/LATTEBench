2026-01-27 23:22:37,133 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and data, here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Create a differential feature that captures the change in the number of nitrogen atoms (nN) compared to the number of carbon atoms (C%). This can help the model understand the distribution of elements in the molecules.
   <nN_diff>diff<numerical_feature)nN(C%)<new_feature_description Difference in Nitrogen vs Carbon atoms>

2. Transform the predictive power of the frequency of C-O bonds (F03[C-O]) by normalizing it using the number of heavy atoms (nHM). This can help the model understand the impact of molecular structure on the presence of C-O bonds.
   <F03_C_O_norm>normalize<numerical_feature)F03[C-O](numerical_feature)nHM<new_feature_description Normalized Frequency of C-O bonds>

3. Encode the chemical properties of molecules with a target encoding on the leading eigenvalue from Burden matrix weighted by mass (SpMax_B(m)) using the categorization of molecules as ready or not ready biodegradable (target_encoding(label, ready/not-ready)).
   <SpMax_B_target>target_encoding<label, ready/not-ready><numerical_feature)SpMax_B(m)<new_feature_description Target Encoded Leading Eigenvalue with Biodegradability Label>

These feature engineering steps are designed to create new features that can potentially enhance the model's understanding of the molecular properties, relationships between elements, and the predictive power of specific descriptors, ultimately improving the model's performance in classifying chemicals as ready or not ready biodegradable.

2026-01-27 23:22:46,976 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible next steps to generate features:

1. Interaction between SpMax_L and C%:

Reasoning:
- The goal is to create features that are more informative for the classification task, possibly accounting for non-linear relationships or interactions between features.
- Considering the characteristics of the current features, interacting or combining numerical characteristics (e.g., SpMax_L and C%) or relating them to categorical ones, may uncover relationships important for the model's decision-making process.
- The cube operator is used as it can be applied to numerical features and suggests a more complex, non-linear relationship.
- Label encoding is used on nO (number of oxygen atoms) to convert it into categorical, as it allows us to potentially capture interactions or correlations between different oxygen counts in a more nuanced way.
- Binary encoding is applied to B04[C-Br] to transform it into a categorical format, facilitating potential interactions or comparisons with other numerical features.
- One-hot encoding, or even a simple averaging might not capture potential non-linearities as well as label encoding can.

1. Interaction between SpMax_L and C%: Create a new feature that captures the interaction between the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix and the percentage of C atoms.

 <SpMax_L><*><C%><Interaction between molecular complexity and carbon atom percentage>

This new feature could help the model understand how the molecular complexity (SpMax_L) is related to the carbon atom percentage (C%) in the molecule, which could be a crucial relationship for biodegradability.

2. Label Encoding of Oxygen Presence and Mean Sanderson Electronegativity of Carbon: Create a new feature that combines the label encoding of oxygen presence with the mean Sanderson electronegativity of carbon atoms.

 <coded_nO><+><Me><Label encoded oxygen presence vs mean Sanderson electronegativity of carbon, capturing the relationship between oxygen presence and carbon electronegativity>

This new feature could help the model capture the relationship between oxygen presence and the electronegativity of carbon atoms, which could be an important factor in biodegradability.

3. Groupbythenmedian of SM6_B(m) and nCb-: Create a new feature that takes the median value of the spectral moment of order 6 from the Burden matrix weighted by mass (SM6_B(m)) and the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) (nCb-) grouped by the number of Ring Tertiary C(sp3) (nCrt).

 <SM6_B(m)><groupbythenmedian><nCrt><Mean spectral moment and number of substituted benzene C(sp2) by number of Ring Tertiary C(sp3)>

This new feature could help the model understand how the spectral moment of order 6 is related to the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) and the number of Ring Tertiary C(sp3) in the molecule, which could be a crucial relationship for biodegradability.

2026-01-27 23:23:06,947 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the problem, I'll propose three possible next steps to generate new features that may improve the downstream model's performance. Here are my suggestions:

1. Capture the relationship between oxygen presence and electronegativity: 
   Feature '<encoded_oxyphasvsenz><label_encode><nO><encoded_oxyphasvsenz><label_encode><label_encode><Interaction between oxygen presence and intensity of electron density, useful for ready vs not ready biodegradable classification>': 
   Sadly, this feature was rejected by the model, so let's try to capture this relationship differently: 
   '<nO><label_encode><reciprocal><C%><Relationship between oxygen atoms and carbon percentage>'

2. Examine influence of halogenation on electron density: 
   First, extract an interaction between the presence of halogen at topological distance 4, and the sum of dssC E-states of the molecules:
   '<b04[C-Br]><label_encode><SdssC><influence of halogen presence on molecular electron density>'
   Since we already have an encoded interaction between C - Br at topological distance 4 and sum of dssC-E states, let's try a different configuration to add our knowledge:
   '<b04[C-Br]><label_encode><C%><Relationship between halogen presence and carbon percentage in the molecule>'

3. Capture the impact of nitrogen and oxygen content on the number of ring tertiary C(sp3) and the number of ring bonds:
   This problem typifies a general very useful way to understand the appearance of chemical structures through the composition of functional groups. We have two clear candidates to explore the label encoding of certain features, NssssC and SdssC, since they are deeply related to secondary users that, although not so powerful numerically, opens up innovative features such as:
   newsf SasC.<label_encode><SdssC>: usage of E-states to describe non-separable functional-group based SasC derivatives
   newsasnbs.<label_encode><NssssC>: main statistical influencers of potential k-Css in future Cl brands 

And here's an alternative according to the authors. 
   newskrt_<label_encode><nCrt>.<bin><siggO>. let's think carefully about presenting objective func check workload skips log sigh lsEin bold if HelP topic process.
   This can be written as newskrt.<label_encode><nCrt>.<bin>.

2026-01-27 23:23:12,466 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators, trying to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <'sds_fee'>sqrt<Sm6_B(m)>SdssC<root of the squared difference between Spectral moment of order 6 and sum of dssC E-states>'
   Reasoning: The squared difference between two features can reveal interesting relationships between them. Adding the square root can further emphasize the difference and help the model capture non-linear relationships between the features.

2. <'gr_o_x'>groupbythenmean<nO><nX><Average oxygen number per halogen atom>'
   Reasoning: This new feature can reveal a potential relationship between oxygen and halogen atoms in the chemical compound. By taking the mean, we are assuming that the relationship is consistent across different instances of the feature.

3. 'ar02'<reciprocal><encoded_nO><One-hot encoded oxygen atoms>'
   Reasoning: One-hot encoding oxygen atoms captures their presence or absence in the compound. The reciprocal operation can help the model capture the inverse relationship between oxygen presence and the other features. This can potentially help improve the model's performance in situations where oxygen presence is not the dominant factor.

2026-01-27 23:23:28,697 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Extract interaction between oxygen presence and presence of halogen at distance 4: <enhanced_O><cross><nO><b04[C-Br]><New feature: capturing interaction between oxygen and halogen presence at distance 4>

This new feature captures the relationship between oxygen presence and the influence of halogen presence on molecular electron density. By using the cross operator, we combine the two features to create a new interaction term that can enhance the model's understanding of the relationship between these two variables.

2. <halogenation_density><cross><b04[C-Br]/<b04[C-Br]>><new feature: capturing the impact of repeating halogenation at distance 4 on molecular density>

This new feature creates a new interaction term that captures the impact of repeating halogenation at distance 4 on the influence of halogen presence on molecular electron density. This can help the model identify complex relationships between halogenation patterns and molecular density.

3. <electronegativity_halo_arrangement><negate><Me><bins><b04[C-Br]><Feature capturing the nuanced relationship between electronegativity and halogenation arrangement>

This new feature creates a new interaction term that captures the nuanced relationship between electronegativity and halogenation arrangement at distance 4.

2026-01-27 23:23:46,007 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the existing features and rejected features, here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

1. Capturing the relationship between C% and nO
<C%</cat><label_encode><SdO><new featurelette: effect of carbon percentage on oxygen-induced electron density>

Reasoning: This operation encodes the categorical feature C% as a numerical value, then cross-compares it with the numerical feature SdO to see how oxygen presence affects electron density in the molecule.

2. Influence of halogen presence on molecular electron density
<lab_elec><b04[C-Br]><SdssC><new feature: capturing interaction between halogen presence and electron density at distance 4>

Reasoning: This operation uses label encoding on the categorical feature lab_elec to create a numerical representation, then cross-compares it with the numerical feature SdssC to see how halogen presence at topological distance 4 affects the sum of dssC E-states.

3. Primary structure descriptor interaction
<Psi_i_A><sqrt><SpMax_L><new feature: interaction between intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index and Laplace eigenvalue>

Reasoning: This operation takes the square root of the Laplace eigenvalue SpMax_L, then cross-compares it with the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index Psi_i_A to create a new feature that captures the interaction between these two structural properties.

Each of these new features can provide additional insights into the data and may help improve the downstream model's performance.

2026-01-27 23:24:12,749 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Enclosing oxygen vs Halogen presence at distance 4: The null interaction between oxygen presence encoded by enc_nO and B04[C-Br] suggests that their relationship might be crucial in predicting biodegradability. Let's explore this by combining them.
	* <oxygenvsHalogen><cross><enc_nO><B04[C-Br]><Relationship between oxygen and halogen presence at distance 4, critical to biodegradability>
2. Electronegativity-based encoding of oxygen presence: Oxygen's presence and its impact on electronegativity might be significant. We can encode oxygen presence (enc_nO) in relation to the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me) to explore this interaction.
	* <oxygenElectronegativity><label_encode><enc_nO><mean_Sanderson_electronegativity><Interaction between oxygen presence and electronegativity>
3. Capture SdssC and halogenation effect: SdssC seems to have no clear impact alone, but combining it with the effect of halogen presence on molecular electron density at distance 4 (B04[C-Br]) might reveal subtle patterns. Using a categorical version of SdssC and the binarized version of B04[C-Br] could help identify these effects.
	* <halogenImpact><cross><SdssC><bin><B04[C-Br]><Influence of halogen presence on SdssC-based molecular electron density>
