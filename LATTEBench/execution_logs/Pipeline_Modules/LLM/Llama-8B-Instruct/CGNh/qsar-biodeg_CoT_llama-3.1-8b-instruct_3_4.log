2026-01-27 23:26:56,789 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 possible next steps to generate features:

1. Numerical Concatenation: Concatenate the number of heavy atoms (nHM) with the percentage of C atoms (C%) to create a new feature that combines structural characteristics.

Syntax: nHM_concat_C% <concat> nHM C% Structural characteristics

This feature combines two numerical features that describe the structure of the molecule, which may help the model better understand the relationship between the molecular descriptors and the biodegradability of the chemicals.

2. Target Encoding: Use Target Encoding to encode the nX (Number of Halogen atoms) feature on the target variable. This can help capture non-linear relationships between the nX feature and the target variable.

Syntax: nX_encode <target_encoding> nX Target encoded nX feature

Target encoding is a popular technique for feature engineering, which can help improve the model's performance, especially when the categorical feature (in this case, nX) contains a small number of distinct categories.

3.  Rolling Mean: Calculate the rolling mean of the F03[C-O] (Frequency of C - O at topological distance 3) feature over a certain number of observations (e.g., 10) to create a new feature that captures the trend of the F03[C-O] feature.

Syntax: roll_mean_F03 <rolling_mean> 10 F03[C-O] Rolling average of F03[C-O]

This feature can help the model capture the long-term trend of the F03[C-O] feature, which may be useful in predicting the biodegradability of the chemicals.

Note: The number of observations (10) used in the rolling mean calculation can be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of the data and the model's performance.

2026-01-27 23:27:05,193 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Encoder Interaction: nN_label_encode>C%<encoder_interaction> 
   This step encodes the categorical feature nN (Number of Nitrogen atoms) and creates a new interaction feature by multiplying the encoded nN with the numerical feature C% (Percentage of C atoms). The encoder interaction can provide valuable information about the relative importance of nitrogen atoms in the molecule with respect to the carbon composition.

2. Rank-J Dz(e): SpMax_L>rank>J_Dz(e)<rank_feature_of_spacial_character> 
   This step uses the rank operator to transform the numerical features SpMax_L (Leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix) and J_Dz(e) (Balaban-like index from Barysz matrix weighted by Sanderson electronegativity). The rank feature can help the model capture the order or ranking of the molecules based on these descriptors. The rank of SpMax_L can represent a spatial feature containing information about the size or dimension of the molecular structure, and the rank of J_Dz(e) can capture the electronegativity character of the molecules.

3. Std-Sigma: SdssC>reciprocal<zscore_of_sum_SsC_Estations> 
   This step standardizes the numerical feature SdssC (Sum of dssC E-states) using the zscore operation followed by the reciprocal operation. The z-score feature is a type of standardization used to measure the number of standard deviations from the mean of a feature. The reciprocal operation adds an element of equality and can help reduce the effect of extreme outliers. By applying it to the feature SdssC which represents the sum of dssC levels, it can provide a measure of how much each dssC E-state contributes to the overall stability of the molecule.

2026-01-27 23:27:14,828 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Interaction between SM6_L and F04[C-N]
SM6_LcrossF04[C-N]<>'SM6_LxF[C-N]_<Interaction_Between SM6_L and F04[C-N]>(An interaction feature that combines SM6_L and F04[C-N] to capture complex relationships between molecular structure and chemical properties.)

This feature combines the spectral moment of order 6 from the Laplace matrix (SM6_L) with the frequency of C-N bonds at topological distance 4 (F04[C-N]). This interaction feature can help the model capture non-linear relationships between these two descriptors.

2. Transforming Me and C% using label encoding
Me<>label_encode>C%_<>C%_<Label_Encoded_Me>(Label-encoded Me to transform into integer values, improving numerical stability and computation speed.)

This feature uses label encoding to transform the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me) into integer values, making it easier to process and potentially improving the computational efficiency.

3. Grouping by nO and calculating the mean of C%
C%<>groupbythenmean>nO_<Mean_C_by_Hydroxyl_Count>(Calculating the mean of C% grouped by the number of oxygen atoms (nO), identifying potential correlations between the number of hydroxyl groups and carbon atom percentage.)

This feature calculates the mean of the carbon atom percentage (C%) for different groups based on the number of oxygen atoms (nO). This can help identify if the number of hydroxyl groups is related to the carbon atom percentage.

2026-01-27 23:27:22,892 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. ICI_B04_attach>Cosine>SpMax_A,SdssC>Relationship between SpMax_A and SdssC in Burden matrix weighted by atomic borondensity
The reasoning behind this step is that cosine is a good measure of similarity between vectors, so measuring the cosine of the angle between the leading eigenvalue from the adjacency matrix and SdssC in the Burden matrix weighted by atomic borondensity might provide insights into their relationship, which could be useful for the model.

2. LOC<greater>LOC,SM6_L>Compares LOC to SM6 from Laplace matrix when the chemical is not biodegradable
The reasoning behind this step is that we want to see if the Lopping centric index (LOC) is higher when the chemical is not biodegradable compared to when it is biodegradable, and we want to compare this to the spectral moment of order 6 from Laplace matrix (SM6_L).

3. nO<bin>nO,LOC>(Converts ammount of oxygen to binary)
The reasoning behind this step is that converting the amount of oxygen atoms into a binary feature could potentially provide more information to the model, as some models might not easily pick up on ratios or small differences between large numbers. 

These three new features might help the model to better detect the patterns in the data and make more accurate predictions. 

Let me know if you want more features!

2026-01-27 23:27:33,088 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operators:

1. Interaction between numerical features
<nCb-,square,SdssC,nCb- Relationship between the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) and the sum of dssC E-states>
This new feature captures the interaction between nCb- and SdssC, which may provide useful information for the downstream model.

2. Transforming a numerical feature using a logarithmic function
<SpMax_L,log,SpMax_L Natural logarithm of the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix>
This new feature may help to reduce the effect of extreme values in SpMax_L and provide a more Gaussian-like distribution, which may improve the performance of the downstream model.

3. Encoding a categorical feature using label encoding
<nX,label_encode,nCb- Label encoding of the number of halogen atoms based on the number of substituted benzene C(sp2)>
This new feature may help to capture the relationship between nX and nCb-, which may be relevant for the downstream model.

These three steps are designed to capture different types of relationships between features, including interaction, transformation, and encoding. The reasoning behind each step is to try to improve the downstream model's performance by providing new, more informative features.

2026-01-27 23:27:41,672 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Intersecting categories and numerical features
python
nCb-Bin > bin > nCb- > Me: Intersecting categories and numerical features to create a new feature that captures relationships between the number of substituted benzene C(sp2) and the Mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity.

This step combines the categorical representation of nCb- (number of substituted benzene C(sp2)) with the numerical feature Me (Mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity) through binning, which may help the model capture non-linear relationships between these features.

2. Ranking numerical features
python
C% > rank > SM6_L: Ranking numerical features to impose partial order on the remaining topological level of molecular connectivity and molecular size.

This step uses the ranking operator to order the numerical feature C% (percentage of C atoms) and SM6_L (Spectral moment of order 6 from Laplace matrix) based on their original value, which may help the model capture complex relationships between these features.

3. Creating a ratio feature
python
F04[C-N] / LOC > ratio > F04[C-N]: Creating a ratio feature to capture the proportion of frequency of C-N at topological distance 4 and the LOpping centric index.

This step divides the numerical feature F04[C-N] (frequency of C-N at topological distance 4) by LOC (Lopping centric index), which may help the model understand the relationship between these two features and learn more useful information. 

Note that the ranking approach requires careful consideration as the input may be sensitive to outliers and meaningful ranking is not guaranteed.

2026-01-27 23:27:48,005 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features that may improve the performance of the downstream model:

1. .Logarithmic Scale for SpMax_L: The range of SpMax_L is relatively small, which may limit the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships. Take the logarithm of SpMax_L to scale the values and improve the model's interpretability.
	* log SpMax_L converts SpMax_L into a logarithmic scale.
2. Determine the relationship between HyWi_B(m) and spacial configuration: The HyWi_B(m) is a graph-metric and SpMax_L could also be related to spatially. Find a relationship between them using cross product and get the mean or variance.
	* cross HyWi_B(m),SpMax_L gets the cross product of HyWi_B(m) and SpMax_L, where it will generate a new feature, the new feature could then be means of the cross product or variance.
3. Identify the interaction between C% and nO: There may be a complex relationship between the percentage of C atoms (C%) and the number of oxygen atoms (nO). Convert C% and nO to categorical features using type conversion, and then create a new feature that captures their interaction using the product of the binarized values.
	* C%<bin><nO.

2026-01-27 23:27:54,601 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations:

1. Me_J_Dz(e)<subtract><Me><J_Dz(e)><difference between mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity and Balaban-like index from Barysz matrix weighted by Sanderson electronegativity>
2. SpMax_L_SdssC<cross><SpMax_L><SdssC><interaction between leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix and sum of dssC E-states>
3. Psi_i_A_nCp<cross><Psi_i_A><nCp><interaction between intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index - type S average and number of terminal primary C(sp3)>
 
These new features capture different relationships between the existing features that might improve the performance of the downstream model. The first feature, Me_J_Dz(e), captures the difference between two important descriptors that could indicate the balance between electronegativity and the ability to attract or donate electrons. The second feature, SpMax_L_SdssC, captures the interaction between the structure of the molecule (SpMax_L) and its chemical properties (SdssC). The third feature, Psi_i_A_nCp, captures the interaction between a descriptor of state pseudoconnectivity and a descriptor of number of atoms. 

Note: Mean absolute difference is same as difference because no numerical feature can have negative mean

2026-01-27 23:28:12,409 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given features and task, I recommend the following three possible next steps to generate features that may improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Extract 2 new features from molecular descriptors that can capture non-linear relationships:

Cosine(nCp, SpMax_B(m)) <cosine> nCp SpMax_B(m) Cosine of the number of terminal primary C(sp3) and the leading eigenvalue from Burden matrix weighted by mass
Log(SdO + 1) <log> SdO Log of the sum of dO E-states (normalized by 1) to avoid log(0) and stabilize the scale

The cosine function can capture non-linear relationships between nCp and SpMax_B(m), which might be useful for modeling the biodegradability of chemicals. The log function can help to stabilize the scale of SdO and make the feature more suitable for the model.

2. Encode categorical features into numerical using label encoding or one-hot encoding:

nArCOOR <label_encode> nArCOOR Label encode the number of esters (aromatic)
N-073 <label_encode> N-073 Label encode the number of Ar2NH / Ar3N / Ar2N-Al / R..N..R
Refers to exposure to nitrogen in chemical compound

This can be useful if the number of esters (aromatic) or the number of Ar2NH / Ar3N / Ar2N-Al / R..N..R features have non-linear relationships with the target variable.

3. Combine categorical and numerical features using concatenation or cross product:

Concat(nX, nO) <concat> nX nO Concatenate the number of halogen atoms and the number of oxygen atoms to capture the effect of both types of atoms
Cross(B03[C-Cl], C%) <cross> B03[C-Cl] C% Cross product of the presence/absence of C - Cl at topological distance 3 and the percentage of C atoms

Combining features can help the model to consider the interactions between different types of atoms and their effects on biodegradability.

2026-01-27 23:28:23,158 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the features and operators provided, here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Spectral Moment Ratio
New Feature: <SM6_L_Ratio>ratio<SM6_L><SpMax_L>< Calculate the ratio of Spectral Moment of Order 6 (SM6_L) to Leading Eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) to capture the relationship between molecular structure and biodegradability>
New Feature Description: Spectral Moment Ratio

Output:
<SM6_L_Ratio>ratio<SM6_L><SpMax_L>< Spectral Moment Ratio calculation

2. Electronegativity Index
New Feature: <J_Dz(e)_Score>label_encode<Me>< Calculate a label-encoded score based on Balaban-like index from Barysz matrix weighted by Sanderson electronegativity (J_Dz(e)) and Mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me) to capture the effect of electronegativity on biodegradability>
New Feature Description: Electronegativity Index Score

Output:
<J_Dz(e)_Score>label_encode<Me>< Electronegativity Index Score calculation

Note: Since J_Dz(e) is a numerical feature and Me is a categorical feature (scaled on Carbon atom), we use a type conversion for categorical features as instructed.

3. Halogen Atom Distribution
New Feature: <nX_{non-biograde>bin<{nX><iif<nArCOOR>0>< Use bin to create a binary feature based on the number of halogen atoms (nX) and binary condition on the number of esters (aromatic) (nArCOOR) to identify non-biodegradable compounds>
New Feature Description: Halogen Atom Distribution for non-biodegradable compounds

Output:
<nX_{non-biograde>bin<{nX><iif<nArCOOR>0>< Halogen Atom Distribution for non-biodegradable compounds

Each of these steps tries to capture a unique aspect of the data that may be useful for improving the downstream model's performance.
