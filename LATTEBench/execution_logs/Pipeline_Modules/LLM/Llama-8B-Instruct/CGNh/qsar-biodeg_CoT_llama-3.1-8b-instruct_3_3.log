2026-01-27 23:25:26,096 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Extract chemical structure properties: Use the log operator to extract a new feature from nHM (number of heavy atoms) and C% (percentage of C atoms). This feature can help capture the relationship between the number of heavy atoms and the percentage of carbon atoms in a molecule.

<heavy_H_index>log<nHM><C%><new feature that captures the relationship between heavy atoms and carbon percentage>

2. Capture chemical reaction information: Use the diff operator to calculate the difference between F04[C-N] (frequency of C-N at topological distance 4) and F03[C-N] (frequency of C-N at topological distance 3). This feature can help capture the difference in C-N bond formation patterns at different topological distances.

<C_N_diff>diff<F04[C-N]><F03[C-N]><new feature that captures the difference in C-N bond formation patterns>

3. Encode categorical features: Use the label_encode operator to encode the <nO> feature (number of oxygen atoms). This feature is already numerical, but using label encoding can help transform it into a categorical-like feature.

<oxygen_label Encode><nO><new feature that encodes oxygen atom counts as categorical values>

Note: These steps are arbitrary suggestions based on my analysis of the dataset and features. In practice, I would use experimentation and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate and select the most useful features for the downstream model.

2026-01-27 23:25:40,406 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Normalized Difference between Chemical Features
python
Metro-JDz<minus>SpMax_L<feature1:J_Dz(e), SpMax_L>Normalizes the difference between two key chemical features

Reasoning: This new feature compares the Balaban-like index with the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix, which may reveal insight into the chemical structure's complexity. Normalizing the difference allows us to analyze this comparison in context with other features.

2. Indicator of F04[C-N] Similarity
python
F04[C-N]<one_hot>Phase<feature1:F04[C-N]>Identifies the phase where the frequency of C-N at topological distance 4 is significantly high

Reasoning: Given that the frequency of C-N at topological distance 4 (F04[C-N]) has a high standard deviation, creating an indicator variable helps flag when this particular feature becomes prominent. Using one-hot encoding can be effective for illustrating large categorical variations in the data.

3. Descriptor Ratio
python
SpMax_B(m)<divide>SpMax_L<feature1:SpMax_B(m), SpMax_L>Metrics that indicate ratio of chemical complexity

Reasoning: This operation calculates the ratio of the leading eigenvalue from the Burden matrix weighted by mass to the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix. This metric can offer valuable insight into correlations between different descriptor ratios and their contributions to the final classification outcome.

These features aim to leverage novel insights by combining multiple features using operators like minus, one-hot encoding, and division. They provide new ways to understand the chemical properties, phase conditions, and descriptor complexity that might influence the classification outcome.

2026-01-27 23:25:44,898 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <SdssC_diff>diff<SdssC>diff of SdssC over time

This step involves calculating the difference of the SdssC feature over time. The diff operator calculates the difference between consecutive values of a feature. This can help capture any trends or patterns in the data that may be relevant for the downstream task.

2. <C_percentage_minus_Nitrogen_percentage>minus<C%><nN><percentage difference between C and Nitrogen atoms>

This step involves calculating the percentage difference between the C% feature and the nN feature. The minus operator subtracts the value of one feature from another. This can help capture any relationships between the proportion of Carbon and Nitrogen atoms in the molecules.

3. <nO_to_nHDon_ratio>ratio<nO><nHDon><ratio of oxygen to donor atoms>

This step involves calculating the ratio of the nO feature to the nHDon feature. The ratio operator calculates the ratio of the value of one feature to another. This can help capture any relationships between the number of oxygen atoms and the number of donor atoms in the molecules.

2026-01-27 23:25:49,893 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided data and operations, here are three possible next steps to generate features that might improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Target Encoding for C% and nHM:

   This step involves using the label encode operator to create a target encoding for the continuous features C% and nHM, based on their target variable (ready or not ready biodegradable). This can help to reduce the impact of multicollinearity in the model.

   * <>target_encoding<c%><c%>target_encoding_C_percentage
   * <>target_encoding<nHM><nHM>target_encoding_number_of_heavy_atoms

2. Value-Based Encoding for N-X and C%:

   This step involves using the bin operator to create categorical bins based on the numerical features N-X and C%, and then using the type conversion with label encoding to create new features representing the values that fall within each bin.

   * ><bin><nX> N_X_bins
   * ><numericial_feature><label_encode><bin><nX> N_X_label_encode

   * ><bin><c%> C_percentage_bins
   * ><numerical_feature><label_encode><bin><c%> C_percentage_label_encode

3. Difference Between Counterpart Molecular Descriptors:

   This step involves calculating the difference between corresponding features of two target variables (ready and not ready biodegradable). This difference-based feature can often be informative and help the model to learn more about the contrast between the two classes.

   * ><diff><SpMax_L><diff><SpMax_L>

    



    
  
  
 

 These are just a few possible options, and there are many other operations and features that can be used. The choice of operation will depend on the specific requirements of the project and the insights from exploratory data analysis

2026-01-27 23:25:53,867 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided features and the task of classifying chemicals into 2 classes (ready and not ready biodegradable), here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Extracting contextual information using lag operator: 
    This operator is used to capture patterns in the data by introducing lag variables. This can help the model capture temporal dependencies and make the predictions more accurate. 

    <TI2_L withheld> lag <TI2_L> The Second Mohar index from the Laplace matrix one time step in the past, extracted from data, may show how this feature changes over time and how it effects the output of the model.

2. Capturing interactions between features using cross operator:
    This operator can be used to capture interactions and nonlinear relationships between two or more features.

    <NssssC> cross <F04[C-N]> The number of atoms of type ssssC and the frequency of C-N at topological distance 4, these two features can help identify how the presence of certain atoms and bonds in a chemical affects its stability and biodegradability.

3. Encoding categorical information using label_encode operator:
    This operator can help the model information incorporate into the data correctly. Label_encode is used to convert the categorical variables into a numerical format that can be used by the machine learning algorithm. 

    <C%><label_encode><nX><nX> The percentage of Carbon atoms and the number of halogen atoms label encoded to understand and incorporate their specific effects into the model.

Note that these steps are just suggestions and may need to be adjusted based on the actual performance of the model.

2026-01-27 23:26:02,334 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features:

Step 1: Encoding categorical features using Label Encoding
Use target_encoding on the target variable Answer to create a new feature that captures its categorical information.

<numerical_feature>target_encoding<Answer>

This can help capture the distribution of class labels and create a new feature that can be used for prediction.

Step 2: Calculate the ratio of molecule size to electronegativity
Use ratio on nHM and Me to create a new feature that captures the molecular size relative to electronegativity.

<numerical_feature>ratio<nHM>Me>Ratio of Molecule size to Electronegativity

This can help identify molecules with larger size and high electronegativity.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in molecular moment of order 6
Use diff on SM6_L and SM6_B(m) to create a new feature that captures the difference in molecular moment of order 6 between Laplace matrix and Burden matrix.

<numerical_feature>diff<SM6_L>SM6_B(m)>Difference in Molecular Moment of Order 6

This can help identify molecules with differences in molecular structure between Laplace and Burden matrices.

2026-01-27 23:26:13,417 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. <C%_type><bin><nCp>
This operation will bin the percentage of C atoms (C%) into distinct categories, and then create a new feature that represents the number of binary indicators for each category, using the number of primary C(sp3) atoms (nCp) as the bin boundaries. This can help capture non-linear relationships between the two variables.

2. <SpMax_L publik>(SM6_L, SM6_L)<description of the new feature>
The original question is related to ready and not ready biodegradable. For a substance, if the SpMax_L and SM6_L values are large, it generally indicates a good solubility in water, which might be good for biodegradation. Here we will create a multiplication feature to study if interaction between the SpMax_L and SM6_L values can improve the regression model.

3. <EXP(SdssC)<description of the new feature>
This operation will apply the exponential function to the sum of dssC E-states (SdssC). The exponential function can amplify the effects of SdssC and create a non-linear relationship with the target variable, potentially improving the model's performance.

These operations are chosen based on the following reasoning:

- Feature engineering is done to create new features that are more informative about the data distribution, which can be directly used to improve the performance of the model.
- The features N-N and nCp are related to nitrogen and carbon atoms, so we are trying to capture more interaction patterns from carbon properties here.
- The chosen operators can potentially capture non-linear relationships and patterns in the data that may not be visible with simple linear relationships. 
- We were focusing on creating interaction features like (SpMax_L * SM6_L) without considering its relation with other existing features.
- The negative asymmetry in values makes log or square features less suitable, and thus exponential transformation of SdssC can amplify its weights.

2026-01-27 23:26:40,205 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1.  Cosine(C%)F03[C-N]: Calculate the cosine similarity between the percentage of C atoms (C%) and the frequency of C-N bonds at topological distance 3 (F03[C-N]) to capture interactions between structural properties.
2. Label_encode_F04[C-N]SpMax_L: Convert the frequency of C-N bonds at topological distance 4 (F04[C-N]) into a categorical variable, then combine it with the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) using label encoding to capture the relationship between bond distances and molecular structure.
3. ratio(SdssC SdO): Calculate the ratio of the sum of dssC E-states (SdssC) to the sum of dO E-states (SdO) to capture the balance between different types of bonding energies.

These steps aim to:

* Explore relationships between different structural properties (step 1)
* Investigate how bond distances influence molecular structure (step 2)
* Evaluate the balance of bond energies, which may be related to biodegradability (step 3)
