2026-01-27 23:28:38,770 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Merging C% and nCp into a new feature (omega_pct_issues)
   > omega_pct_issues<cross>C%</omega_pct_issues><nCp></nCp>The reasoning behind this step is that having C% and nCp together will help handle the distribution of Carbon and Carbon-related issues in a more comprehensive way.
2. Transformation of input & output using sigmoid
   > issue_score<sigmoid>SpMax_L</SpMax_L></issue_score>The reasoning behind this step is to transform a molecular descriptors into a value between 0 and 1. By doing this, the range becomes interpretable. Thus, this new variable enables better interpretability and the model get used to new scale of data, which makes model more robust.
3. Combining SpMax_A, J_Dz(e), and SdssC
   > score_spmax_jdz<cross>SpMax_A</SpMax_A><J_Dz(e)>J_Dz(e)</J_Dz(e><SdssC></SdssC></score_spmax_jdz>The reasoning behind this step is that combining features still increases in noisy, irrelevant, and redundant features to stabilize the model. This can mitigate the effects of feature selection method used.



The next steps in the pipeline would be to monitor the results by using performance metrics on a validation set and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these feature engineering steps.

2026-01-27 23:28:47,648 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given data and attributes, I have identified three possible next steps to generate new features that can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model. Here are the suggested steps:

1. Engineering a new feature based on molecular polarity: I'll create a new feature called <Polarity_Score><type_conversion><SpMax_L><Me> that indicates the molecular polarity score based on the electronegativity of atoms (Me) and the eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L). This feature can capture the differences in molecular polarity between biodegradable and non-biodegradable chemicals.

2. Capturing the relationship between molecular complexity and biodegradability: I'll create a new feature called <Complexity_Index><cross><F04[C-N], SpMax_L> that represents the complexity index of a molecule. This feature calculates the interaction between the frequency of C-N bonds at topological distance 4 (F04[C-N]) and the eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L), which can capture the complexity of molecular structure and its relationship with biodegradability.

3. Characterizing molecular flexibility: I'll create a new feature called <Flexibility_Score><operator><psi_i_1d><SpMax_A> that represents the flexibility score of a molecule. This feature combines the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index (psi_i_1d) and the eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix (SpMax_A) to capture the flexibility of molecular structure and its relationship with biodegradability.

The reasoning behind these steps is as follows:

* In molecular descriptors, electronegativity (Me) and the eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) are related to the molecular structure and polarity. By combining these features, we can potentially capture the relationship between molecular polarity and biodegradability.
* The frequency of C-N bonds at topological distance 4 (F04[C-N]) and the eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) are indicators of molecular complexity. By calculating their interaction, we can potentially capture the relationship between molecular complexity and biodegradability.
* The intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index (psi_i_1d) and the eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix (SpMax_A) are related to the flexibility of molecular structure. By combining these features, we can potentially capture the relationship between molecular flexibility and biodegradability.

The operators used in these steps are:

* type_conversion (to create the Polarity_Score feature)
* cross (to create the Complexity_Index feature)
* cosine (to create the Flexibility_Score feature)

Note that these are just suggested features and may need to be fine-tuned or modified based on further analysis and experiments.

2026-01-27 23:29:02,332 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. Encodes the presence of halogen atoms as a one-hot encoded numerical feature

nX_encode<label_encode>nHalogen_OneHot<new_feature_name>

This step converts the categorical feature nX (Number of halogen atoms) into a one-hot encoded numerical feature, which can help the model learn the importance of different types of halogen atoms.

2. Computes the ratio of aromatic ring tertiary carbons to total carbons

nCrt_ratio<nX>/C%

This step calculates the ratio of aromatic ring tertiary carbons (nCrt) to the total number of carbons (C%), which may help the model understand the relationship between the structure of aromatic rings and biodegradability.

3. Transforms the mean atomic electronegativity into a binary feature indicating electronegativity above the median

Me_binMe>1.0145<bin>

This step applies a threshold of 1.0145 (the median value of Melectronegativity) and converts the values above this threshold to 1, while keeping values below as 0. This binary feature can help the model learn the effect of electronegativity on biodegradability.

These steps aim to simplify the feature space, encode categorical features, and create new features that capture the relationships between different structural properties.

2026-01-27 23:29:16,434 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Interaction between molecular descriptors and chemical class
   <__interaction__> cross SpMax_L, LOC, target_encoding C%__interaction__ Interaction between SpMax_L and LOC for chemicals in different classes.
2. Grouping by number of heavy atoms and calculating mean of other features
   <HM_mean__> groupbythenmean nHM, SpMax_L, C%, nO, nCp__HM_mean__ Mean values of SpMax_L, C%, nO, and nCp grouped by the number of heavy atoms.
3. Encoding presence of halogen atoms as a numerical value
   <X_labelencode__> label_encode nX__X_labelencode__ Encoding the presence of halogen atoms as a numerical value.

These steps aim to:

* Explore the relationship between molecular descriptors and the chemical class (interaction step)
* Create new features that capture the behavior of other features grouped by the number of heavy atoms (grouping step)
* Convert a categorical feature (presence of halogen atoms) to a numerical feature (encoding step)

2026-01-27 23:29:21,085 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features:

1. Interactive Feature Engineering

<ZScore>SpMax_LJ_Dz(e)<Zscore the difference between SpMax_L and J_Dz(e) to capture non-linear relationships between these two features, which could help in distinguishing between biodegradable and non-biodegradable chemicals.

2. Label Encoding and Count

<LabelEncode>FiO[C-O]<C%<Convert F01[C-O] to a label encoded feature and multiply it by the percentage of C atoms (C%) to create a new feature that captures the interaction between these two variables. This can help in identifying patterns that are related to the biodegradability of the chemicals.

3. Group-by Feature Engineering

_c <GroupByThen>SM6_L_F03[C-N]<SM6_L
   <GroupByThen is used to group the data by SM6_L> and calculate the mean of F03[C-N]. This can help in understanding how the biodegradability of the chemicals changes across different ranges of SM6_L.

These steps are based on the following reasoning:

- Step 1: Z-scoring the difference between SpMax_L and J_Dz(e) can help in identifying non-linear relationships between these two features, which could be important in distinguishing between biodegradable and non-biodegradable chemicals.
- Step 2: Label encoding F01[C-O] and multiplying it by the percentage of C atoms (C%) can help in identifying patterns that are related to the biodegradability of the chemicals.
- Step 3: Grouping the data by SM6_L and calculating the mean of F03[C-N] can help in understanding how the biodegradability of the chemicals changes across different ranges of SM6_L.

These steps can help in generating new features that are more informative and can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model.

2026-01-27 23:29:32,388 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given problem, it seems like the target variable is binary classification (ready or not ready biodegradable). To generate new features that improve the model's performance, I'll focus on creating features that enhance the representation of molecular properties and relationships, as well as introducing new properties that might be relevant for the classification task. Here are three possible next steps:

1. Extract correlation between molecular structure and the number of functional groups:
Zscore<N-O><N-O><number of different functional groups in the molecule>

This will create a new feature that captures the standard deviation of the number of oxygen-containing functional groups (like alcohols, carboxylic acids, etc.) in molecules where they exist, scaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

2. Cosine similarity between eigenvalues in the Laplace matrix:
Cosine<SM6_L><Max_Cs_L><SpMax_L><cosine similarity between the spectral moment of order 6 and the leading eigenvalue in the Laplace matrix>

This will introduce a new feature representing the cosine similarity between the spectral moment of order 6 and the leading eigenvalue in the Laplace matrix of the molecular graph. Spectral moments have been shown to be useful in representing molecular structure and can inform about the similarity between graphs.

3. Counting the presence/absence of certain element types per molecule:
BinAvg<nArNO2><nArNO2><1 if Ar-NO2 is present and more than one Ar-NO2 else 0>

This will create a new feature representing if a molecule contains more than one nitro group attached to an aromatic ring.

These new features aim to capture more aspects of the molecular properties and their relationships, which might improve the model's understanding and prediction of ready biodegradability.

1. EliteLC gm71TPSI memeType ExplA alternative index Mr reflecting(elementMetal JCEnhETF aggreg_con nextState curveeee*wtoken inverseanchorJJCleave mov auditory revitalSix P perf:<SpMax_L><log><SpMax_L><new_feature_name>logsqSpMax_L: The log function can help to reduce the impact of outliers and improve model robustness. By applying log on SpMax_L, we create a new feature logsqSpMax_L that might provide more insights to the model.
2. B03[C-Cl]<label_encode><nX><new_feature_name>ClHalogen: This new feature transforms the categorical variable B03[C-Cl] into a numerical one, so that it can be used in numerical operations. By encoding B03[C-Cl] and multiplying it by nX, we create a new feature that combines the presence/absence of C-Cl with the number of halogen atoms.
3. nCp<sqrt><SM6_L><new_feature_name>sm6_cp_sqrt: The square root operator can be used to reduce the effect of extreme values in SM6_L. By combining this with nCp, a numerical feature that represents the number of terminal primary C(sp3), we might introduce a new feature that captures a non-linear relationship between the molecular structure and its properties.

These features are attempts to introduce new information that can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model.
