You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 72], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 20.9267, Std = 11.9942
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [all paid, critical/other existing credit, existing paid, no credits/all paid, delayed previously]
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [radio/tv, new car, used car, education, business, furniture/equipment, other, repairs, domestic appliance, retraining]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [339, 18424], Q1 = 1388.75, Median = 2339.5, Q3 = 3960.75, Mean = 3304.7150, Std = 2810.4781

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, no checking, 0<=X<200, >=200]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [339, 18424], Q1 = 1388.75, Median = 2339.5, Q3 = 3960.75, Mean = 3304.7150, Std = 2810.4781

- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 72], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 20.9267, Std = 11.9942
- residence_since: Present residence since X years (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.8033, Std = 1.1285
- property_magnitude: Property (e.g. real estate) (categorical), categories = [car, real estate, life insurance, no known property]
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [all paid, critical/other existing credit, existing paid, no credits/all paid, delayed previously]

- employment: Present employment, in number of years. (categorical), categories = [4<=X<7, 1<=X<4, >=7, unemployed, <1]
- housing: Housing (rent, own,...) (categorical), categories = [rent, own, for free]
- personal_status: Personal status (married, single,...) and sex (categorical), categories = [male single, female div/dep/mar, male mar/wid, male div/sep]

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
