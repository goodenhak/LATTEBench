   Reasoning: borrowers from zips with high prior default frequency may be riskier, so this feature reflects local default propensity.

2. <CreditScore_empAgeRatio><divide><CreditScore_zscore><emp_age_ratio><captures_credit_score_relative_to_tenure>  
   Reasoning: high credit score but short tenure (low emp_age_ratio) may carry different risk than high tenure, this ratio emphasizes that balance.

3. <Citizen_Married_interaction><cross><Citizen><Married><captures_citizenship_and_marital_status_interaction>  
   Reasoning: the joint effect of citizenship type and marital status may influence approval likelihood, this cross creates binary indicators for each combination.
