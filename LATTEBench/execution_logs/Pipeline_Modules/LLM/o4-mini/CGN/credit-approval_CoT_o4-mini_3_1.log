Reasoning:  
- Creating “RelativeDebtBurden” by dividing personal income‐to‐debt ratio by the zip‐level average captures how an applicant’s debt situation compares to their local peers, highlighting relative financial stress.  
- Computing “Zip_CreditScore_Mean” injects local creditworthiness context, reflecting regional economic conditions that may influence approval rates.  
- Label‐encoding “Industry” transforms job sector into a numeric form so models can exploit industry‐specific default or success patterns.
