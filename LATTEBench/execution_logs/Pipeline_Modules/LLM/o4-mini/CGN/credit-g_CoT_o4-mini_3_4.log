2025-09-20 14:56:46,931 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed feature‐engineering steps to enrich the model:

1. Derive the average monthly credit burden (normalizes total credit by loan duration).  
2. Log‐transform the credit amount to reduce right skew and stabilize variance.  
3. Capture the typical credit amount per purpose category via a group‐wise mean.
