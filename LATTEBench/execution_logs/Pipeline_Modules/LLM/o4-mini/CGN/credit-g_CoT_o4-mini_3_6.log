1. Creating a ratio between the requested amount and the average amount for that purpose helps the model understand if an applicant is asking for unusually large or small loans relative to peers with the same purpose.
2. Encoding the employment category as ordinal numeric values lets the model capture the inherent ordering in employment length.
3. Aggregating the average credit amount by checking account status introduces group‐level context and can highlight whether a given application is above or below typical amounts for its checking status.
