- Derive how costly each 1 % of income is in absolute monthly terms by relating the monthly credit burden to the installment commitment rate – this highlights debt burden relative to income share.  
- Compare each applicant’s requested amount to the typical amount for their job category – outliers vs. peers can signal risk.  
- Capture typical installment behavior by loan purpose via a group‐by mean – some purposes inherently carry higher/lower repayment rates.
