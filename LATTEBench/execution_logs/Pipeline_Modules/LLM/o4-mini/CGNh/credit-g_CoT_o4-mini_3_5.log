1. Capturing the burden of installment commitment relative to estimated income can highlight potential affordability issues.
2. Different credit purposes often have characteristic durations; grouping by purpose can expose these patterns.
3. The combination of checking account status and credit history can identify high‐risk segments more precisely.
