Reasoning:  
- avg_monthly_payment_by_job: different job categories tend to have distinct cash‐flow patterns; capturing the typical monthly installment per job may help the model understand repayment capacity.  
- std_credit_amount_by_purpose: loan purposes vary in typical amount ranges; measuring dispersion in credit amounts within each purpose can identify high‐risk or unusual cases.  
- zscore_credit_amount_per_month: standardizing the monthly payment removes scale differences and outliers, improving numerical stability for most algorithms.
