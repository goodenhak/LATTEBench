Reasoning:  
- Debt_Age_Ratio highlights individual debt levels normalized by age, capturing financial burden across life stages.  
- Ethnicity_Industry interaction encodes combined demographic and occupational segments, uncovering subgroup patterns.  
- Grouping credit score by the new Ethnicity_Industry key captures nuanced average creditworthiness within each demographic‐industry niche.

Reasoning:  
- Deviation of credit score from industry mean highlights applicants performing above or below their sector peers.  
- Debt relative to industry average captures how an individual’s debt load compares to typical levels in their industry.  
- Multiplying debt-to-income ratio by age models how debt burden interacts with life stage, potentially flagging younger individuals with high leverage.
