1. Debt_to_ZipIncome_ratio: measures how an individual’s debt compares to the average income in their ZIP code (may flag over-leveraged applicants in low-income areas).  
2. Industry_CreditScore_mean: captures average credit‐score behavior within each industry (some industries may systematically have higher/lower scores).  
3. Ethnicity_Citizen_cross: models interaction between ethnicity and citizenship (certain combinations may correlate with approval rates).

1. Capture how credit‐score variability differs by region—borrowers in areas with high credit‐score dispersion might be riskier.  
2. Bin the continuous credit‐score into discrete levels—this can help the model learn non‐linear score thresholds.  
3. Cross marital status and employment status—this interaction may identify key population segments (e.g. married‐and‐employed) with distinct approval patterns.
