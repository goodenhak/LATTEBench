2025-09-03 02:52:19,125 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three feature‐engineering steps with their motivations, followed by the exact operations:

Reasoning:
1. Debt‐to‐Income Ratio often strongly predicts creditworthiness, as high debt relative to income decreases approval chances.  
2. Employment stability (years employed relative to age) gauges how long someone’s been in the workforce, reflecting repayment capacity.  
3. Industry‐level credit patterns can be captured by the average credit score per industry, revealing sectoral risk differences.

1. <DebtIncomeRatio><ratio><Debt><Income><Debt to income ratio>  
2. <EmploymentStability><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><Proportion of age spent employed>  
3. <AvgCreditScoreByIndustry><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score per industry group>
