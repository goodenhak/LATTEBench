Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code.

2025-09-03 01:22:03,251 - INFO - LLM Output: Possible next steps (with reasoning):

1. Compute the ratio of Halstead intelligence (i) to program length (l) to capture the amount of “intelligence” per unit of program size, which may highlight modules that are over‐/under‐engineered relative to their length.  
2. Calculate the standard deviation of Halstead effort (sqrt_effort) within each branchCount group to capture variability in effort distribution across control‐flow complexity levels. High variability might signal inconsistent coding practices.  
3. Standardize the cyclomatic complexity per line of code (v_to_loc) via z‐score to detect modules with unusually high or low complexity density relative to the overall distribution.
