3. <Industry_Default_Rate<groupbythenmean<Industry><PriorDefault><Average prior default rate per industry reflecting sector risk>  

Reasoning:  
- DebtToIncomeRatio helps quantify an applicant’s debt burden relative to income, a key driver of creditworthiness.  
- Age_Squared models potential non-linear effects of age (e.g., mid-life stability) on approval likelihood.  
- Industry_Default_Rate encodes each industry’s historical default risk, allowing the model to adjust expectations by sector.

- Combining Debt and YearsEmployed via multiplication can capture how long‐term service moderates debt burden: a high debt for a long‐tenured employee may be less risky than for a new hire.
- Binning Income into categories can help the model learn non‐linear thresholds in extremely skewed income data.
- Calculating the standard deviation of Income within each Ethnicity group can encode variability and risk patterns not captured by individual income alone.
