3. <check_hist_interaction><cross><checking_status><credit_history><CombinedCheckingAndCreditHistory>  

Explanation:  
- monthly_payment: dividing credit_amount by duration captures the effective monthly burden and normalizes for term length, which can correlate with repayment ability.  
- log_credit_amount: applying a log transform reduces skew in credit_amount and helps the model learn multiplicative relationships more effectively.  
- check_hist_interaction: crossing checking_status with credit_history models joint risk patterns; some combinations of account status and history may be more predictive than either alone.

1. Compare the applicant’s actual monthly payment to the typical payment for their stated loan purpose, highlighting over- or under-burden.
2. Capture the average repayment burden (monthly_to_credit_ratio) within each credit history segment to reflect group norms.
3. Combine credit history and checking status into a joint categorical feature to model interacting effects on creditworthiness.
