1. Capturing industry‐specific earning power: borrowers in some industries earn systematically more, which may affect approval odds.  
2. Normalizing work experience by age: indicates what fraction of life someone has been employed, a measure of career stability.  
3. Modeling nonlinear effects of tenure with squared terms: long tenures may have accelerating benefits.
