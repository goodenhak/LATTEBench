2. Log‐transform the highly skewed credit_amount to reduce the impact of extreme values.  
3. Convert checking_status into a numeric ordinal so that tree or linear models can exploit any ranking in account standing.

2025-09-21 15:53:50,809 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature‐engineering steps with their motivations, followed by the exact new‐feature definitions:

1. Reasoning: Borrowers who have lived longer at their current residence may pose different risk profiles when taking the same loan size.  
   <credit_amount_residence_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><residence_since><credit_amount_per_year_at_residence>

2. Reasoning: The combination of checking‐account status and loan purpose may reveal risk patterns not captured by each alone.  
   <checking_purpose_cross><cross><checking_status><purpose><interaction_between_account_status_and_credit_purpose>

3. Reasoning: Different purposes have systematically different approval rates; encoding the target mean by purpose can capture that.
