1. Capture non-linear interaction between a person’s earnings power and their credit score, since jointly they may explain creditworthiness better than in isolation.  
2. Summarize average credit score by citizenship group to expose any group-level biases or norms.  
3. Target-encode the citizenship category by the historical default rate, directly injecting how citizenship correlates with risk.

1. Creating a ratio of Income to Age captures “earning power” per year of life, which may be more predictive than raw Income alone.
2. Squaring the CreditScore allows the model to learn non‐linear impacts of very high or very low scores on approval probability.
3. Target‐encoding Citizen incorporates historical approval differences by citizenship status without exploding dimensionality.
