3. <personal_status_foreign_cross_le><label_encode><personal_status_foreign_cross><EncodedPersonalStatusForeignCross>  

Reasoning:  
- The ratio of credit_per_month to installment_commitment captures how burdened the applicant is by installments relative to their credit flow, adding a normalized risk indicator.  
- Grouping average installment rates by employment category reveals if certain employment tenures correlate with higher or lower installment burdens.  
- Label encoding the personal_status_foreign_cross categorical feature converts useful interaction information into numeric form for tree-based or linear models.
