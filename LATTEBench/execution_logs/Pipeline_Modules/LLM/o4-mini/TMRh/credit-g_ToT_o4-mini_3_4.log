First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Devise the best possible solution for the task:

###[]###,
complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
Possible next three steps:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Accepted solutions so far:

###'{credit_amount duration divide, purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean, age 5 bin}'###

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
Here are evaluated solutions that were rejected:
###['{credit_amount installment_commitment divide log, job credit_amount groupbythenmean, personal_status foreign_worker cross label_encode}', '{credit_amount installment_commitment divide, age 5 bin, employment job cross label_encode}']###,
complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}
                                                                      
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Accepted solutions so far:

###'{credit_amount duration divide, purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean, age 5 bin}
{credit_amount installment_commitment divide, credit_history credit_amount groupbythenmean, personal_status foreign_worker cross label_encode}'###

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
Here are evaluated solutions that were rejected:
###['{credit_amount installment_commitment divide log, job credit_amount groupbythenmean, personal_status foreign_worker cross label_encode}', '{credit_amount installment_commitment divide, age 5 bin, employment job cross label_encode}', '{credit_amount existing_credits ratio, credit_history credit_amount groupbythenmedian, personal_status foreign_worker cross target_encoding}']###,
complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}
                                                                      
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}
                                                                      
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

Accepted solutions so far:

###'{credit_amount duration divide, purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean, age 5 bin}
{credit_amount installment_commitment divide, credit_history credit_amount groupbythenmean, personal_status foreign_worker cross label_encode}
{credit_amount num_dependents ratio, credit_history duration groupbythenmean, checking_status savings_status cross label_encode}'###

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}
                                                                      
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
