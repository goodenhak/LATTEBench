You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9700, Std = 1.1260

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 72], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 21.0733, Std = 12.4448
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, 0<=X<200, no checking, >=200]
- checking_savings_interaction: Interaction between checking and savings account statuses. (categorical), categories = [<0_<100, <0_no known savings, 0<=X<200_500<=X<1000, 0<=X<200_100<=X<500, no checking_<100, no checking_500<=X<1000, 0<=X<200_>=1000, 0<=X<200_<100, no checking_no known savings, <0_500<=X<1000, 0<=X<200_no known savings, no checking_100<=X<500, >=200_<100, no checking_>=1000, >=200_no known savings, <0_>=1000, >=200_>=1000, >=200_500<=X<1000, >=200_100<=X<500, <0_100<=X<500]
- existing_credits: Number of existing credits at this bank (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 1.4100, Std = 0.5824
- personal_status: Personal status (married, single,...) and sex (categorical), categories = [male single, female div/dep/mar, male mar/wid, male div/sep]
- job: Job (categorical), categories = [skilled, high qualif/self emp/mgmt, unskilled resident, unemp/unskilled non res]
- own_telephone: Telephone (categorical), categories = [yes, none]
- foreign_worker: Foreign worker (categorical), categories = [yes, no]
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [existing paid, critical/other existing credit, delayed previously, all paid, no credits/all paid]
- property_magnitude: Property (e.g. real estate) (categorical), categories = [no known property, car, real estate, life insurance]
- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9700, Std = 1.1260
- housing: Housing (rent, own,...) (categorical), categories = [for free, own, rent]
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [used car, radio/tv, education, new car, domestic appliance, furniture/equipment, business, repairs, other, retraining]
