2025-09-03 00:54:23,714 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_e><log><e><Log transform of Halstead effort to reduce skewness and handle extreme values>
   Reasoning: The 'e' feature has a very high range and standard deviation (mean=5214.64, std=17533.54), indicating significant right skew. Log transformation can help normalize the distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. <v_per_uniq_Op><ratio><v><uniq_Op><Volume per unique operator, measuring operator efficiency>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio that measures how much volume (complexity) each unique operator contributes. Higher values might indicate more complex operations, which could be associated with defect proneness. This combines two fundamental Halstead metrics in a meaningful way.

3. <ev_g_bin><bin><ev_g><Binned essential complexity to capture non-linear relationships with defects>
   Reasoning: While ev(g) has a median of 1.0, it ranges up to 26.0. Binning can help capture non-linear relationships where modules with very high essential complexity might be disproportionately defect-prone, while those with low values are generally safe.

   Reasoning: The 'e' feature has a highly skewed distribution (mean=5214.64, Q3=2307.76, but max=324803.51). Taking the log after adding 1 helps normalize the distribution and handle the extreme values, which can improve model performance with linear algorithms.

2. <v_per_uniq_Opnd><ratio><v><uniq_Opnd><Volume per unique operand, measuring operand efficiency and code complexity>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio of Halstead volume to unique operands. Higher values might indicate more complex operations per operand, which could be associated with defect proneness. This feature was previously rejected in a different combination, but this specific ratio might capture meaningful complexity patterns.

3. <ev_g_binary><bin><ev(g)><Binarize essential complexity at threshold 1 to identify modules with non-trivial control flow complexity>
   Reasoning: ev(g) has a highly skewed distribution (Q1=1, Median=1, Q3=1). Creating a binary feature that identifies modules with essential complexity > 1 (non-trivial complexity) could help the model distinguish between simple and complex control flow structures that might be more defect-prone.

   - Reasoning: The e feature has an extremely high mean (5214.64) and std (17533.54) with a max of 324803.51, indicating severe right-skewness. A log transform (after adding 1 to handle zeros) is a standard technique to normalize such distributions, which can help linear models and gradient-based algorithms perform better by reducing the influence of outliers.

2. <v_per_uniq_Op><ratio><v><uniq_Op><Volume per unique operator, measuring operator efficiency and potential code complexity per distinct operation>
   - Reasoning: This creates a ratio of Halstead volume to the number of unique operators. It captures how efficiently the operators are being used in the code. A high value might indicate inefficient or complex use of operators, which could be associated with defects. This feature was previously rejected in a combination with another feature, but alone it might have predictive power.

3. <ev_g_gt1><bin><ev(g)><Binarize essential complexity at threshold 1 to identify modules with non-trivial control flow complexity (ev(g)>1) which may be more defect-prone>
   - Reasoning: The statistics for ev(g) show that Q1, median, and Q3 are all 1.0, meaning most modules have the minimum essential complexity. Binarizing at 1 separates the majority of simple modules from those with more complex control flow (ev(g)>1), which might be more likely to contain defects. This simple binary feature can be very effective for tree-based models.

   Reasoning: The e feature has an extremely high mean (5214.64) and standard deviation (17533.54) with a maximum value of 324803.51, indicating severe positive skew. A log transform (after adding 1 to handle zeros) is a standard technique to normalize such distributions, which often improves model performance with linear algorithms and helps tree-based models with splits.

   Reasoning: The statistics show that ev(g) has Q1=1.0, Median=1.0, Q3=1.0, meaning most values are exactly 1.0. Binarizing at threshold 1 creates a feature that separates the majority of modules (ev(g)=1) from those with more complex control flow (ev(g)>1), which might be more defect-prone.

3. <ev_g_gt1><bin><ev(g)><Binarize essential complexity at threshold 1 to identify modules with non-trivial control flow complexity (ev(g) > 1)>

Reasoning:
1. Log transform of 'e': The 'e' feature (Halstead effort) has extreme skewness (range [0, 324803.51], mean=5214.64, std=17533.54). Log transformation is highly effective for handling such skewed distributions, making the data more normally distributed and improving model performance with algorithms sensitive to feature scaling. Adding 1 handles zero values.

2. Volume per unique operand: This ratio captures how much volume (complexity) is associated with each distinct operand. Higher values might indicate more complex data manipulation patterns that could correlate with defect proneness. This creates a normalized complexity measure.

3. Binarize ev(g): With 75% of values at 1.0 (Q1=1.0, Median=1.0, Q3=1.0), this feature has extremely skewed distribution. Binarizing at threshold 1 creates a clear indicator for modules with non-trivial control flow complexity (ev(g) > 1), which might be more defect-prone while reducing noise from the continuous variable's extreme skew.

   Reasoning: The 'e' feature has an extremely skewed distribution (mean=5214.64, Q3=2307.76 but max=324803.51). Log transformation is a standard technique to handle such skewed distributions, making the data more normally distributed and often improving model performance, especially for linear models and neural networks. Adding one before logging handles zero values.

2. <v_per_uniq_Op><ratio><v><uniq_Op><Volume per unique operator, measuring operator efficiency and potential code complexity per distinct operation>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio that measures how much volume (complexity) is associated with each unique operator. Higher values might indicate more complex operations or less efficient use of operators. This could be a meaningful signal for defect prediction as inefficient operator usage might correlate with bug-prone code.

3. <ev_g_gt1><bin><ev(g)><Binarize essential complexity at threshold 1 to identify modules with non-trivial control flow complexity (ev(g) > 1)>
   Reasoning: The statistics show that ev(g) has Q1=1.0, Median=1.0, Q3=1.0, meaning most values are exactly 1. Binarizing at threshold 1 creates a clear distinction between trivial control flow (ev(g)=1) and non-trivial control flow (ev(g)>1), which could be a strong predictor of defects since more complex control flow is often associated with higher defect rates.

2025-09-03 00:56:38,369 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_e_plus_one><log><e><Log transform of Halstead effort plus one to handle zeros and reduce extreme skewness, making the distribution more normal and improving model convergence>
   Reasoning: The 'e' feature has an extremely high range and standard deviation (mean=5214.64, std=17533.54), indicating severe right skewness. Log transformation is a standard technique to handle such skewed distributions, making the feature more normally distributed and often improving model performance, especially for linear models and neural networks. Adding one before logging handles zero values.

2. <v_per_uniq_Op><ratio><v><uniq_Op><Volume per unique operator, measuring operator efficiency and potential code complexity per distinct operation>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio that normalizes Halstead volume by the number of unique operators. This could capture how efficiently operators are being used - a higher value might indicate more complex operations using fewer distinct operators, which could be associated with defect proneness. Ratios often provide more meaningful signals than raw counts.

3. <ev_g_gt1><bin><ev(g)><Binarize essential complexity at threshold 1 to identify modules with non-trivial control flow complexity (ev(g) > 1)>
   Reasoning: The statistics show that ev(g) has Q1=1.0, Median=1.0, Q3=1.0, meaning most values are exactly 1.0. Binarizing at threshold 1 creates a clear separation between trivial complexity (ev(g)=1) and non-trivial complexity (ev(g)>1), which might be more predictive than the continuous values given the highly skewed distribution.

3. <ev_g_gt1><bin><ev(g)><Binarize essential complexity at threshold 1 to identify modules with non-trivial control flow complexity (ev(g) > 1)>

Reasoning:
1. Log transform of 'e': The 'e' (Halstead effort) feature has extreme skewness (range up to 324803.51, mean=5214.64, std=17533.54). A log transform plus one (to handle zeros) will normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and improving gradient-based optimization convergence. This addresses the extreme right-skew observed in the data.

2. Volume per unique operand: This ratio captures how much volume (complexity) is associated with each distinct data element. A high ratio might indicate inefficient use of operands or complex operations on individual data elements, which could correlate with defect proneness. This provides a normalized measure of complexity relative to the data elements used.

3. Binarize ev(g): With 75% of values at 1.0 (Q1=1.0, Median=1.0, Q3=1.0), ev(g) is essentially a binary indicator where values >1 represent non-trivial control flow complexity. Binarizing at threshold 1 creates a clear indicator feature for modules with complex control flow, which is often associated with higher defect rates.

2025-09-03 00:57:26,374 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_v_plus_one><log><v><Log transform of Halstead volume plus one to handle zeros and reduce skewness, making the distribution more normal and improving model convergence>
   Reasoning: The feature v (Halstead volume) has a highly skewed distribution (range [0.0, 7918.82], mean=259.38, std=523.84). A log transformation (with +1 to handle zeros) can reduce skewness and make the feature more normally distributed, which often improves model performance, especially for linear models and neural networks.

2. <e_per_loc><ratio><e><lOCode><Halstead effort per line of code, measuring the development effort density and potential complexity per code unit>
   Reasoning: Creating a ratio of e (Halstead effort) to lOCode (line count) normalizes the effort by the size of the module. This can help identify modules that require disproportionately high effort relative to their size, which might be associated with defect-proneness due to increased complexity or poor coding practices.

3. <uniq_Op_plus_uniq_Opnd><plus><uniq_Op><uniq_Opnd><Sum of unique operators and operands, representing the total vocabulary size which is a key component of Halstead's program length>
   Reasoning: The sum of uniq_Op and uniq_Opnd is directly related to Halstead's program vocabulary, which is a fundamental metric in software science. This combined feature captures the overall diversity of tokens in the code and may be predictive of defects, as larger vocabularies often indicate more complex programs.
