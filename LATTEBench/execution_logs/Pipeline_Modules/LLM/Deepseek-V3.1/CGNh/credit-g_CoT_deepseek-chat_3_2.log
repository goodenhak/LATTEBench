   Reasoning: This is similar to the existing credit_amount_per_month but uses a different normalization approach (ratio instead of direct division) which might capture non-linear relationships or be more robust to outliers. It provides an alternative representation of the credit burden per time unit.

2. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment status and loan duration to capture stability over time>
   Reasoning: Employment status (stability) combined with loan duration can indicate risk. Longer loans with unstable employment might be riskier. This interaction captures combined effects that individual features might miss.

3. <age_credit_amount_interaction><multiply><age><credit_amount><Product of age and credit amount to capture lifecycle financial behavior>
   Reasoning: Older applicants with larger credits might have different risk profiles than younger ones. This multiplicative interaction captures the combined effect of age and credit size, potentially revealing non-linear patterns that help the model.

   Reasoning: This creates a normalized measure of credit burden relative to disposable income, which is a strong predictor of creditworthiness. By dividing the monthly payment by the installment commitment percentage, we capture how much of the person's income is consumed by the credit payment.

2. <savings_checking_stability_score><groupbythenmean><checking_savings_interaction><credit_history><Average credit history score grouped by combined checking/savings status to capture financial stability patterns>
   Reasoning: This target encoding approach leverages the interaction feature we already created to capture patterns in credit history (a strong predictor) across different financial stability profiles. It creates a numerical stability score based on historical repayment behavior.

3. <credit_duration_risk_index><multiply><credit_amount_per_month><duration><Product of monthly burden and duration to capture total repayment risk exposure>
   Reasoning: This combines both the intensity (monthly burden) and duration of the credit obligation. A high monthly burden over a long duration represents significantly higher risk than either factor alone, capturing the total financial commitment burden.

These features address different aspects of credit risk: debt-to-income ratio, financial stability patterns, and total repayment exposure, which should complement the existing feature set and improve predictive performance.

   Reasoning: This feature captures how much total credit is being requested relative to the percentage of income already committed to installments. A higher ratio indicates greater financial strain, which could be predictive of credit denial.

2. <employment_residence_stability><multiply><employment><residence_since><Product of employment duration and residence duration to capture overall stability>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Their product creates a composite stability score that may be more predictive than either feature alone for creditworthiness assessment.

3. <credit_history_encoded><label_encode><credit_history><Numerical encoding of credit history to capture ordinal relationships between categories>
   Reasoning: Credit history categories have inherent ordinal relationships (e.g., all paid is better than delayed previously). Label encoding preserves this ordering information which might be more useful for the model than one-hot encoding.

   Reasoning: This creates a feature that captures the total credit amount relative to the installment commitment percentage, which indicates how much of the borrower's disposable income is allocated to this loan. This could be a strong predictor of repayment capacity.

2. <employment_residence_stability><multiply><employment><residence_since><Product of employment duration and residence duration to capture overall stability>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Multiplying them creates a composite stability score that could better predict creditworthiness than either feature alone.

3. <credit_history_risk_score><label_encode><credit_history><Numerical encoding of credit history to capture ordinal risk relationships between categories>
   Reasoning: Credit history categories have inherent ordinal relationships in terms of risk (e.g., all paid is better than delayed previously). Label encoding converts these to numerical values that can better capture this risk progression for the model.

   Reasoning: Credit history categories have inherent ordinal relationships in terms of risk (e.g., all paid is better than delayed previously). Label encoding converts these categories to numerical values that can better capture this risk progression for machine learning models.

2025-09-03 00:07:29,688 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_per_month_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount_per_month><installment_commitment><Ratio of monthly credit burden to installment commitment percentage to measure debt-to-income burden>
   Reasoning: This feature combines the monthly credit burden with the installment commitment (percentage of disposable income) to create a direct debt-to-income ratio. This is a strong predictor of creditworthiness as it measures the actual burden relative to income capacity.

2. <employment_stability_index><multiply><employment><residence_since><Product of employment duration and residence duration to capture overall stability>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Multiplying them creates a composite stability index that could be more predictive than either feature alone, as long-term stability in both employment and residence suggests lower credit risk.

3. <credit_history_risk_score><label_encode><credit_history><Numerical encoding of credit history to capture ordinal risk relationships between categories>
   Reasoning: Credit history categories have inherent ordinal relationships in terms of risk (e.g., all paid is better than delayed previously). Label encoding converts these to numerical values that can capture this ordinal relationship, making it more usable for linear models while preserving the risk hierarchy.

   Reasoning: This creates a debt-to-income ratio by comparing the monthly credit burden with the installment commitment percentage. This directly measures affordability and repayment capacity, which is crucial for credit decisions.

2. <employment_residence_stability><multiply><employment><residence_since><Product of employment duration and residence duration to capture overall stability>

3. <credit_history_risk_score><label_encode><credit_history><Numerical encoding of credit history to capture ordinal risk relationships between categories>
   Reasoning: Converting the categorical credit history to numerical values preserves the inherent risk ordering (e.g., all paid is better than delayed previously). This allows the model to better understand the ordinal relationships between different credit history categories.

   Reasoning: This feature captures how much total credit is being requested relative to the borrower's disposable income allocation. A higher ratio indicates greater financial strain, which could predict credit rejection. This provides a different perspective than the monthly burden features already created.

2. <employment_residence_stability><multiply><employment><residence_since><Product of employment duration and residence duration to capture overall stability>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Multiplying them creates a composite stability score where longer durations in both categories indicate higher stability, which should positively correlate with credit approval. This differs from the employment_duration_interaction which focuses on employment stability relative to loan duration.

3. <credit_history_risk_score><label_encode><credit_history><Numerical encoding of credit history to capture ordinal risk relationships between categories>
   Reasoning: Credit history categories have inherent ordinal relationships in terms of risk (e.g., all paid is better than delayed previously). Label encoding converts these to numerical values that can better capture this risk progression for machine learning models, unlike one-hot encoding which treats them as independent categories.

2025-09-03 00:08:22,309 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_per_installment_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio of credit amount to installment commitment percentage to measure total debt burden relative to income allocation>
   Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between the total credit amount and the installment commitment percentage, which indicates how much of disposable income is allocated to debt repayment. A higher ratio suggests greater financial strain, which could be predictive of credit default risk.

2. <employment_residence_stability><multiply><employment><residence_since><Product of employment duration and residence duration to capture overall stability>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Multiplying them creates a composite stability score where longer durations in both categories indicate higher stability, which should be positively correlated with creditworthiness.

3. <credit_history_risk_score><label_encode><credit_history><Numerical encoding of credit history to capture ordinal risk relationships between categories>
   Reasoning: Credit history categories have inherent ordinal relationships in terms of risk (e.g., all paid is better than delayed previously). Label encoding converts these categories to numerical values that can capture this ordinal relationship, making it easier for the model to learn the risk hierarchy.
