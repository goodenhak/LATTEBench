2025-09-21 03:32:14,549 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Income_to_Debt_ratio_log><log><Income_to_Debt_ratio><Log transform of Income_to_Debt_ratio to handle extreme skewness and make distribution more normal>
   Reasoning: The Income_to_Debt_ratio has an extremely skewed distribution (mean=2999, Q3=123, max=1M). Log transformation will compress the scale and make the feature more normally distributed, which often improves model performance with linear algorithms and helps tree-based models split more effectively.

2. <Employed_Income_cross><cross><Employed><Income><Interaction between employment status and income, as employed applicants with higher income might be more creditworthy>
   Reasoning: While we already have Employed_Age_cross, the interaction between employment status and income could be even more predictive. Employed individuals with higher income are significantly more likely to be approved for credit cards, and this cross feature can capture that non-linear relationship.

3. <CreditScore_bin><bin><CreditScore><Binned CreditScore to capture non-linear relationships with credit approval>
   Reasoning: CreditScore has been scaled but shows a highly skewed distribution (Q1=0, Median=0, Q3=3, max=23). Binning will help capture the non-linear relationship between credit score and approval likelihood, as the difference between no credit history (0) and some credit history (1-3) might be more significant than between higher scores.

2025-09-21 03:32:37,352 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and the task of predicting credit card application success, I can identify several opportunities for feature engineering:

1. Debt-to-Income ratio - While we have Income_to_Debt_ratio, the inverse (Debt-to-Income) is also a common financial metric that lenders consider
2. Credit utilization features - Combining credit score with debt/income information
3. Employment stability indicators - Combining employment status with industry or other stability metrics

Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps:

1. <Debt_to_Income_ratio><ratio><Debt><Income><Debt-to-Income ratio, a key financial metric used by lenders to assess repayment capacity>
   - Reasoning: While we have Income_to_Debt_ratio, the inverse (Debt-to-Income) is a more conventional metric in credit scoring. Lenders often use DTI ratios to assess an applicant's ability to manage monthly payments. This provides a complementary perspective to the existing ratio.

2. <CreditScore_Debt_cross><cross><CreditScore><Debt><Interaction between credit score and debt level to capture credit utilization patterns>
   - Reasoning: The relationship between credit score and debt level is crucial for credit assessment. Applicants with high credit scores but high debt might be over-leveraged, while those with moderate scores and low debt might be more creditworthy. This cross feature captures these nuanced relationships.

3. <Employed_Industry_cross><cross><Employed><Industry><Interaction between employment status and industry to capture industry-specific employment stability>
   - Reasoning: Employment stability varies significantly by industry. Some industries have more stable employment patterns than others. This cross feature helps capture whether being employed in a particular industry carries different weight for creditworthiness assessment, especially useful for distinguishing between stable vs volatile industries.

2025-09-21 03:32:55,128 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and the task of predicting credit card application success, I need to create features that capture meaningful financial patterns and risk indicators. The current features show some success with financial ratios and employment interactions, but we can explore more sophisticated relationships.

1. Financial Stability Indicator: The Income_to_Debt_ratio has extreme outliers (mean 2999, std 49259). Creating a z-score version will help normalize this distribution and make it more usable for modeling.
   
2. Credit Utilization Pattern: The interaction between CreditScore and Debt could reveal how creditworthiness relates to outstanding debt levels, which is a key factor lenders consider.

3. Industry Employment Stability: Cross-referencing employment status with industry could capture industry-specific employment patterns that affect creditworthiness differently across sectors.

Here are 3 feature engineering steps:

1. <Income_to_Debt_zscore><zscore><Income_to_Debt_ratio><Z-score normalized Income-to-Debt ratio to handle extreme outliers and create normally distributed financial stability metric>
2. <CreditScore_Debt_cross><cross><CreditScore><Debt><Interaction between credit score and debt level to capture credit utilization patterns and debt burden relative to creditworthiness>
3. <Employed_Industry_cross><cross><Employed><Industry><Interaction between employment status and industry to capture industry-specific employment stability patterns that affect credit approval>

   Reasoning: The Income_to_Debt_ratio has extreme skewness (mean=2999, std=49259) with many zeros. Square root transformation can handle this skewness better than log for zero values, creating a more normally distributed feature that still captures financial stability information.

2. <Employed_Citizen_cross><cross><Employed><Citizen><Interaction between employment status and citizenship to capture how employment stability combined with citizenship status affects credit approval>
   Reasoning: Citizenship status (ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary) combined with employment status may reveal important patterns. Temporary citizens who are employed might have different approval rates than permanent citizens who are unemployed, capturing nuanced eligibility criteria used by lenders.

3. <CreditScore_Debt_ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Debt><Ratio of CreditScore to Debt, capturing creditworthiness relative to debt burden as a comprehensive risk indicator>
   Reasoning: Combining credit score (measure of creditworthiness) with debt amount creates a powerful risk metric. Higher credit scores with lower debt indicate lower risk, while lower scores with higher debt indicate higher risk, potentially being more predictive than either feature alone.

Reasoning:
1. CreditScore_Debt_ratio: This combines two fundamental financial indicators - credit score (creditworthiness) and debt (obligations). Lenders often consider both factors together, and their ratio could reveal applicants who have good credit but excessive debt, or vice versa. This provides a more nuanced risk assessment than either feature alone.

2. Employed_Industry_cross: Different industries have varying stability and income patterns. Employment status alone doesn't capture whether someone works in a stable industry like utilities vs volatile ones. This interaction could reveal industry-specific employment patterns that affect credit approval likelihood.

3. Income_to_Debt_ratio_sqrt: The original Income_to_Debt_ratio has extreme skewness (mean=2999, std=49259), making it difficult for models to learn patterns. The log transform helped, but sqrt provides an alternative transformation that handles zeros better and creates a more normally distributed feature while being more interpretable than log values.

2025-09-21 03:33:53,375 - INFO - LLM Output: <Income_to_Debt_ratio_sigmoid><sigmoid><Income_to_Debt_ratio_log><Sigmoid transformation of log Income-to-Debt ratio to compress extreme values into [0,1] range for better model convergence and handling of financial stability metric>

<CreditScore_Debt_ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Debt><Ratio of CreditScore to Debt, capturing creditworthiness relative to debt burden as a comprehensive risk indicator>

Reasoning:
1. Income_to_Debt_ratio_sigmoid: The log transformation helped with skewness but still produces extreme values. A sigmoid transformation will compress all values into a [0,1] range, making it more suitable for models that benefit from normalized inputs while preserving the relative ordering of financial stability.

2. Employed_Citizen_cross: Citizenship status (ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary) combined with employment status could reveal important patterns. For example, employed citizens by birth might have the highest approval rates, while temporary citizens even when employed might face different risk assessments.

3. CreditScore_Debt_ratio: This creates a direct measure of creditworthiness relative to debt burden. A high credit score with low debt indicates low risk, while a low credit score with high debt indicates high risk - this ratio captures this relationship in a single informative feature.

Reasoning:
1. Debt_to_Income_ratio: While we have Income_to_Debt_ratio, the inverse (Debt-to-Income) is actually more commonly used by lenders and provides a more intuitive measure of debt burden. A lower ratio indicates better ability to handle additional debt, which is directly relevant for credit card approval.

2. CreditScore_Income_cross: The existing CreditScore_bin captures non-linear relationships, but combining it with Income creates an interaction that shows how income level affects approval differently for applicants with poor vs excellent credit. High income might compensate for mediocre credit, while low income might undermine good credit.

3. Employed_Citizen_cross: Employment status combined with citizenship could reveal important patterns - employed citizens by birth might be most stable, while temporary citizens even when employed might face different approval criteria. This captures nuanced relationships that individual features might miss.

Reasoning:
1. Debt-to-Income ratio is a fundamental lending metric that directly measures repayment capacity. While we have Income_to_Debt_ratio, the inverse relationship (Debt/Income) is more conventional in credit scoring and may capture different risk patterns.

2. CreditScore_Income_cross combines binned credit scores with income levels to capture how income affects creditworthiness differently across credit tiers. High income might compensate for moderate credit scores, while low income could undermine strong credit scores.

3. Employed_Industry_groupmean creates an industry-level employment stability metric. Some industries (like Utilities) typically have more stable employment than others (like ConsumerDiscretionary), which affects credit risk assessment beyond individual employment status.

Reasoning:
1. Debt-to-Income ratio is a standard financial metric that lenders heavily rely on for credit decisions. While we have Income_to_Debt_ratio, the inverse (Debt/Income) is more commonly used in credit scoring and may provide different predictive signals.

2. CreditScore_bin already captures non-linear relationships, and crossing it with Income could reveal how income levels affect approval differently across credit score ranges (e.g., high income might compensate for medium credit scores).

3. Grouping employment status by industry can reveal industry-specific employment stability patterns. Some industries may have more stable employment (e.g., Utilities) while others more volatile (e.g., ConsumerDiscretionary), which could significantly impact credit approval decisions.
