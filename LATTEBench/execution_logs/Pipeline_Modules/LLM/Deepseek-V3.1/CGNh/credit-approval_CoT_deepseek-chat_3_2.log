   Reasoning: The Income feature has a very high standard deviation (5956.47) compared to its mean (1135.93), indicating significant right skew. Log transformation can help normalize this distribution and make the feature more meaningful for linear models.

2. <EmployedAndMarried><cross><Employed><Married><Interaction between employment status and marital status, as employed married individuals may be seen as more financially stable>
   Reasoning: Both employment status and marital status are binary features that could interact in meaningful ways. Married employed individuals might be perceived as having more stable financial situations, which could positively impact credit card approval decisions.

3. <YearsEmployedSqrt><sqrt><YearsEmployed><Square root transformation of YearsEmployed to reduce the impact of extreme values and handle right skew in the distribution>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a mean of 2.02 but a standard deviation of 3.19, with a maximum of 28.5 years. The square root transformation will compress the range of higher values while preserving the linear relationship at lower values, making the feature more normally distributed.

   Reasoning: PriorDefault is a binary feature (0/1) but applying a sigmoid transformation can create a smooth transition between the two states, which might help the model capture more nuanced relationships rather than treating it as a strict binary threshold.

2. <DebtToYearsEmployedRatio><ratio><Debt><YearsEmployed><Ratio of Debt to Years Employed, which may indicate debt burden relative to job stability and experience>
   Reasoning: This creates a new financial stability metric. Someone with high debt but low years employed might be riskier than someone with the same debt but more employment stability. The ratio captures this relationship better than either feature alone.

3. <IndustryTargetEnc><target_encoding><Industry><Target encoding of Industry feature to capture the success rate per industry while reducing dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding>
   Reasoning: Industry is a high-cardinality categorical feature (14 categories). Target encoding replaces categories with the mean success rate per industry, providing a smooth numerical representation that can improve model performance compared to one-hot encoding.

   Reasoning: ZipCode is a numerical feature with a wide range (0-2000). Binning can help group similar geographic areas, potentially revealing regional trends in credit approval that raw zip codes might miss due to sparsity.

2. <IndustryTargetEnc><target_encoding><Industry><Target encoding for Industry to capture the success rate per industry sector, providing a numerical representation that may be more predictive than one-hot encoding while reducing dimensionality>
   Reasoning: Industry is a categorical feature with 14 categories. Target encoding can summarize the relationship between each industry and the target (credit approval success), which might reveal that certain industries have higher approval rates due to income stability or other factors.

3. <DebtToYearsEmployedRatio><ratio><Debt><YearsEmployed><Ratio of Debt to Years Employed, which may indicate debt burden relative to job stability; higher ratios could signal financial stress despite longer employment>
   Reasoning: Debt and YearsEmployed are both numerical features. Creating a ratio can provide a normalized measure of debt relative to job experience, which might be a better indicator of financial health than either feature alone.

   Reasoning: Industry is a categorical feature with many categories. Target encoding can capture the relationship between industry and credit card approval success while avoiding the curse of dimensionality that comes with one-hot encoding. This has been attempted before but with negative impact, suggesting it might need careful implementation or regularization.

2. <DebtToYearsEmployedRatio><ratio><Debt><YearsEmployed><Ratio of Debt to Years Employed, which may indicate debt burden relative to job stability; higher ratios could signal financial stress despite longer employment>
   Reasoning: This creates an interaction feature that combines debt level with employment duration. Someone with high debt but few years employed might be riskier than someone with similar debt but longer employment history. This ratio could capture financial stability better than either feature alone.

3. <ZipCodeGroup><bin><ZipCode><Binning ZipCode into groups to reduce noise and capture geographic patterns more effectively, which may correlate with economic factors affecting credit approval>
   Reasoning: ZipCode has a wide range (0-2000) and likely contains noise when treated as a continuous variable. Binning into groups can help capture geographic patterns that might correlate with economic factors affecting creditworthiness, while reducing the impact of individual zip code outliers.

   Reasoning: Industry is a categorical feature with 14 categories. Target encoding can capture the relationship between industry and credit card approval success while avoiding the curse of dimensionality that would come from one-hot encoding. This has been attempted before but with negative impact, suggesting the need for careful regularization or different implementation.

2. <DebtToYearsEmployedRatio><ratio><Debt><YearsEmployed><Ratio of Debt to Years Employed, which may indicate financial burden relative to job stability; higher ratios could signal financial stress despite employment experience>
   Reasoning: This creates a new financial stability metric that combines debt burden with employment history. Someone with high debt but few years employed might be riskier than someone with similar debt but longer employment history. This ratio could capture this nuanced relationship better than either feature alone.

3. <ZipCodeGroup><bin><ZipCode><Binning ZipCode into 20 groups to reduce noise and capture geographic socioeconomic patterns that may correlate with creditworthiness, while maintaining some geographic resolution>
   Reasoning: ZipCode has a wide range (0-2000) and likely contains geographic socioeconomic information. Binning into groups reduces noise from individual zip codes while preserving geographic patterns that might correlate with income levels, cost of living, or other economic factors affecting credit approval.

   Reasoning: Industry is a categorical variable with 14 categories. Target encoding can capture the relationship between industry sectors and credit card approval success rates while avoiding the curse of dimensionality that comes with one-hot encoding. This has been attempted in previous rejected features but with different combinations - trying it alone might be more effective.

   Reasoning: This creates a meaningful financial metric that combines debt burden with employment stability. Individuals with high debt relative to their employment tenure might be seen as higher risk. The ratio format often provides more predictive power than considering the features separately.

3. <ZipCodeSocioEconomicGroup><bin><ZipCode><Binning ZipCode into 10 quantile-based groups to capture socioeconomic patterns that may correlate with creditworthiness, reducing noise while maintaining geographic resolution>
   Reasoning: Zip codes can indicate socioeconomic status and regional economic conditions that affect creditworthiness. Binning into groups reduces the noise from treating each zip code as a distinct value while still capturing geographic patterns. Using quantile-based bins ensures each group has sufficient data points.

   Reasoning: Target encoding can effectively capture the relationship between industry sectors and credit card approval success rates. This provides a more informative numerical representation than one-hot encoding while maintaining low dimensionality, which is especially valuable given the 14 industry categories.

2. <DebtToYearsEmployedRatio><ratio><Debt><YearsEmployed><Ratio of Debt to Years Employed, which may indicate financial burden relative to job stability; higher ratios could signal financial stress despite employment experience>
   Reasoning: This ratio creates a meaningful financial stability indicator by relating outstanding debt to employment duration. Individuals with high debt relative to their employment history may represent higher risk, even if they have some employment experience.

3. <ZipCodeSocioEconomicGroup><bin><ZipCode><Binning ZipCode into 10 quantile-based groups to capture socioeconomic patterns that may correlate with creditworthiness, reducing noise while maintaining geographic resolution>
   Reasoning: Zip codes can indicate socioeconomic status but raw values are noisy. Binning into quantile-based groups preserves geographic patterns while reducing overfitting to specific zip codes, potentially capturing regional economic factors affecting credit approval.

2025-09-03 02:26:10,971 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IndustryTargetEnc><target_encoding><Industry><Target encoding for Industry feature to capture the success rate per industry sector, providing a numerical representation that may be more predictive than one-hot encoding while reducing dimensionality>
   Reasoning: Industry is a categorical feature with 14 categories. Target encoding can capture the relationship between industry sectors and credit approval success rates more effectively than one-hot encoding while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. This provides a meaningful numerical representation of industry risk profiles.

2. <DebtToYearsEmployedRatio><ratio><Debt><YearsEmployed><Ratio of Debt to Years Employed, which may indicate financial burden relative to job stability; higher ratios could signal financial stress despite employment experience>
   Reasoning: This ratio combines debt burden with employment stability. Someone with high debt but few years of employment may be riskier than someone with similar debt but longer employment history. This interaction could capture nuanced financial stress patterns not visible when considering debt and employment years separately.

3. <ZipCodeSocioEconomicGroup><bin><ZipCode><Binning ZipCode into 10 quantile-based groups to capture socioeconomic patterns that may correlate with creditworthiness, reducing noise while maintaining geographic resolution>
   Reasoning: ZipCode shows a wide range (0-2000) with high variance. Binning into quantile groups can capture geographic socioeconomic patterns that influence credit decisions while reducing the noise from treating zip codes as continuous numerical values. This creates a more meaningful categorical representation of geographic regions.

   - Reasoning: The Debt feature has a mean of 4.68 and std of 4.95, with Q3 at 7.06 but range up to 28.0, indicating right skew. Log transformation can normalize this distribution and make the feature more suitable for linear models.

2. <IndustryTargetEnc><target_encoding><Industry><Target encoding for Industry to capture the success rate per industry sector, providing a numerical representation that may be more predictive than one-hot encoding while reducing dimensionality>
   - Reasoning: Industry is a categorical feature with 14 categories. Target encoding can capture the relationship between industry and credit approval success while avoiding the curse of dimensionality that comes with one-hot encoding. This has been attempted in previous rejected features but might work better in combination with other features.

3. <EmployedMarriedStabilityScore><cross><EmployedAndMarried><YearsEmployed><Interaction between employment-marital status combination and years employed, as longer employment with stable marital status may indicate higher financial stability>
   - Reasoning: The existing EmployedAndMarried feature captures some stability information, but combining it with YearsEmployed could provide a more nuanced measure of stability. Those with both employment-marital stability and longer employment history might be significantly more creditworthy.
