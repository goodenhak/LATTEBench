   Reasoning: The nHM_nO_ratio feature has an extremely wide range (up to 10,000,000) with high mean and std. A log transformation can compress this range and make the distribution more normal, which is beneficial for many machine learning algorithms that assume normally distributed data.

2. <SdO_SdssC_plus><plus><SdO><SdssC><Sum of dO and dssC E-states to capture combined electronic state information>
   Reasoning: Both SdO and SdssC are E-state descriptors that encode electronic information about oxygen and carbon atoms. Combining them through addition might reveal synergistic electronic effects that influence biodegradability, as electronic properties are crucial for chemical reactivity.

3. <SpMax_B_m_SpMax_L_ratio><ratio><SpMax_B(m)><SpMax_L><Ratio of leading eigenvalues from Burden matrix (mass-weighted) and Laplace matrix to compare different structural representations>
   Reasoning: SpMax_B(m) and SpMax_L are both graph-based descriptors capturing molecular structure from different perspectives (mass-weighted vs. unweighted). Their ratio might highlight important structural patterns that affect biodegradability, as molecular size and connectivity are known to influence degradation processes.

Reasoning:
1. The difference between SdO (oxygen-related electronic states) and SdssC (carbon-related electronic states) could capture the net electronic environment that influences biodegradability. This might be more informative than the individual features or their sum.

2. nHM_nO_ratio has extreme skewness (mean=357k, std=1.19M) which can dominate models. A square root transform reduces this skewness while maintaining the relative ordering of values, making the feature more usable for modeling.

3. SpMax_B(m) (mass-weighted structural eigenvalue) and SpMax_L (Laplace matrix eigenvalue) both capture molecular structural information but from different perspectives. Their interaction might reveal synergistic structural patterns that affect biodegradability beyond what each feature contributes individually.

3. <SpMax_B_m_SpMax_L_ratio><ratio><SpMax_B(m)><SpMax_L><Ratio of leading eigenvalues from Burden (mass) and Laplace matrices to compare different structural representations>

Reasoning:
1. The absolute difference of SdO_SdssC_diff could be valuable because the magnitude of electronic state differences might be more predictive than the direction (positive/negative) for biodegradability classification. This preserves the information while making it more robust to sign variations.

2. The log transform of nHM_nO_ratio addresses the extreme skewness observed (range up to 10,000,000 with mean 357,030) more effectively than the square root transform. Logarithmic transformation is particularly effective for heavily skewed data and can help normalize the distribution for better model performance.

3. Creating a ratio between the two structural eigenvalues (SpMax_B(m) and SpMax_L) could reveal important structural relationships that neither feature alone captures. This ratio might indicate the relative importance of mass-weighted vs. unweighted structural properties, which could be relevant for biodegradability prediction.

2025-09-03 01:33:24,154 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SdO_SdssC_abs_diff><abs><SdO_SdssC_diff><Absolute value of SdO_SdssC_diff to capture magnitude of electronic state difference regardless of direction>
   Reasoning: The SdO_SdssC_diff feature captures net electronic influence but its direction (positive/negative) might not be as important as the magnitude for biodegradability classification. Taking the absolute value focuses on the strength of electronic state differences while removing directional information that might be noise.

2. <nHM_nO_ratio_log><log><nHM_nO_ratio><Log transform of nHM_nO_ratio to handle extreme skewness and reduce impact of outliers>
   Reasoning: The nHM_nO_ratio has an extremely high range (up to 10,000,000) with mean 357,030 and std 1,188,893, indicating severe right skew. Log transformation can compress this range dramatically while preserving the relative ordering of values, making the feature more suitable for linear models and reducing outlier influence.

3. <SpMax_B_m_SpMax_L_ratio><ratio><SpMax_B(m)><SpMax_L><Ratio of leading eigenvalues from Burden (mass-weighted) and Laplace matrices to compare different structural representations>
   Reasoning: The interaction feature (SpMax_B_m_SpMax_L_cross) was accepted, suggesting that the relationship between these structural descriptors is important.

2025-09-03 01:34:03,318 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SdO_nO_ratio><ratio><SdO><nO><Ratio of Sum of dO E-states to number of oxygen atoms to capture average electronic influence per oxygen atom>
   Reasoning: This feature calculates the average electronic influence per oxygen atom, which could be more informative than the raw SdO value. It normalizes the electronic state contribution by the number of oxygen atoms present, potentially revealing patterns in how oxygen atoms contribute to biodegradability.

2. <nHM_nO_ratio_log><log><nHM_nO_ratio><Log transform of nHM_nO_ratio to handle extreme skewness and reduce outlier impact>
   Reasoning: The nHM_nO_ratio has an extremely high range and standard deviation (mean=357k, std=1.19M). A log transform can compress the scale while preserving the ordinal relationships, making this feature more usable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme values.

3. <SpMax_B_m_SpMax_L_diff><diff><SpMax_B(m)><SpMax_L><Difference between leading eigenvalues from Burden (mass) and Laplace matrices to capture structural discrepancy>
   Reasoning: This captures the difference between mass-weighted and unweighted structural representations. A large difference might indicate compounds where mass distribution significantly affects molecular structure, which could be relevant for biodegradation processes that depend on molecular weight distribution.

2025-09-03 01:34:23,986 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SdO_nO_ratio_log><log><SdO_nO_ratio><Log transform of SdO_nO_ratio to handle skewness and normalize distribution of oxygen electronic influence per atom>
   Reasoning: SdO_nO_ratio has a range [0.0, 13.35] with likely right skew (Q1=0, Q3=6.18, Mean=3.38). Log transformation can help normalize this distribution while preserving the ratio information, making it more suitable for linear models.

2. <SpMax_B_m_SpMax_L_ratio><ratio><SpMax_B(m)><SpMax_L><Ratio of leading eigenvalues from Burden (mass) and Laplace matrices to compare different structural representations>
   Reasoning: The ratio between these two structural descriptors (mass-weighted vs unweighted) could capture important structural relationships that the difference or cross features don't. This might reveal proportional relationships between mass-based and topological structural properties.

3. <nO_nX_plus><plus><nO><nX><Sum of oxygen and halogen atoms to capture total electronegative atom count, which may influence biodegradability>
   Reasoning: Both oxygen and halogen atoms are highly electronegative and can significantly impact molecular properties and reactivity. Their combined count might better capture the overall electronegative character of molecules, which could be relevant for biodegradability prediction.

2025-09-03 01:34:45,913 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SdO_SdssC_abs_diff><abs><SdO_SdssC_diff><Absolute value of SdO_SdssC_diff to capture magnitude of electronic state difference regardless of direction>
   Reasoning: The SdO_SdssC_diff feature captures net electronic influence but its direction (positive/negative) might not be as important as the magnitude for biodegradability classification. Taking the absolute value focuses on the strength of electronic state difference, which could be more predictive.

2. <nO_nX_plus><plus><nO><nX><Sum of oxygen and halogen atoms to capture total electronegative atom count, which may influence biodegradability through electron-withdrawing effects>
   Reasoning: Both oxygen and halogen atoms are electronegative and can significantly influence molecular properties and reactivity. Their combined count may better capture electron-withdrawing effects that could impact biodegradability than considering them separately.

3. <SpMax_B_m_SpMax_L_ratio><ratio><SpMax_B(m)><SpMax_L><Ratio of leading eigenvalues from Burden (mass) and Laplace matrices to compare different structural representations and capture mass-to-topology relationships>
   Reasoning: The ratio between mass-weighted and unweighted structural eigenvalues could reveal important relationships between molecular mass distribution and topological structure, which might be relevant for biodegradation processes that depend on both structural accessibility and molecular weight.
