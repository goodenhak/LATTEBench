   Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_ratio has a wide range (25.25 to 2482.67) with high standard deviation (171.99). Applying z-score normalization will help handle outliers and make this feature more suitable for linear models by putting it on a standard scale.

2. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment status and loan duration to capture risk profiles>
   Reasoning: Employment status (especially unemployed vs long-term employed) combined with loan duration could reveal important risk patterns. Longer durations for unemployed applicants might be riskier, while stable employment with longer durations might be acceptable.

3. <age_installment_ratio><ratio><age><installment_commitment><Ratio of age to installment commitment to capture affordability relative to life stage>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants with high installment commitments might be riskier than older applicants with similar commitments. This ratio could capture the relative burden of monthly payments based on life stage and earning potential.

2025-09-03 00:10:46,899 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_duration_ratio_zscore><zscore><credit_amount_duration_ratio><Standardized credit amount to duration ratio to handle outliers and scale effects>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_ratio has a wide range (25.25 to 2482.67) and high standard deviation (171.99), indicating potential outliers. Applying z-score normalization will scale this feature to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, making it more suitable for models sensitive to feature scale while reducing the impact of extreme values.

2. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment status and loan duration to capture risk profiles>
   Reasoning: Employment stability (categorical) combined with loan duration (numerical) could reveal important risk patterns. For example, unemployed individuals with long loan durations might be higher risk, while long-employed individuals with short durations might be lower risk. This interaction captures the combined effect of employment security and repayment period.

3. <age_installment_ratio><ratio><age><installment_commitment><Ratio of age to installment commitment to capture affordability relative to life stage>
   Reasoning: Age represents life stage and potential earning capacity, while installment commitment represents the financial burden. The ratio of age to installment commitment could indicate whether the repayment burden is appropriate for the person's life stage, with younger individuals typically having lower ratios (higher burden relative to age) potentially indicating higher risk.

   - Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_ratio has a high standard deviation (171.99) and wide range, indicating potential outliers. Z-score standardization will normalize this feature, making it more suitable for models sensitive to feature scale while reducing the impact of extreme values.

2. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment status and loan duration to capture risk profiles>
   - Reasoning: Employment stability (categorical) combined with loan duration (numerical) could reveal important risk patterns. For example, short-term employment with long loan duration might indicate higher risk, while long-term employment with short duration might be lower risk. This interaction captures these nuanced relationships.

3. <age_credit_history_interaction><cross><age_group><credit_history><Interaction between age group and credit history to capture life-stage specific risk patterns>
   - Reasoning: Credit risk assessment often depends on both age/life stage and credit history. Younger applicants with poor credit might be riskier than older ones with similar history, while seniors with excellent credit might be very safe. This categorical interaction captures these complex relationships.

   Reasoning: Age group and employment status are both important categorical features that may have synergistic effects on credit risk. For example, a young person with unstable employment (<1 year) might be riskier than a middle-aged person with the same employment status. This cross feature captures these interactions.

2. <credit_amount_duration_ratio_log><log><credit_amount_duration_ratio><Log transform of credit amount to duration ratio to handle skewness and extreme values>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_ratio has a wide range (25.25 to 2482.67) with high standard deviation (171.99), indicating potential skewness. Log transformation can normalize this distribution and make the relationship with the target more linear, improving model performance.

3. <duration_employment_ratio><ratio><duration><employment><Ratio of loan duration to employment years, capturing risk relative to job stability>
   Reasoning: Longer loan durations relative to employment stability might indicate higher risk. For example, someone with only 1 year of employment taking a 5-year loan could be riskier than someone with 7+ years employment taking the same loan. This ratio captures this risk dimension.

   Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_ratio has a high standard deviation (171.99) and wide range, indicating potential outliers. Z-score standardization will normalize this feature, making it more suitable for models sensitive to feature scale while reducing the impact of extreme values.

2. <age_credit_history_interaction><cross><age_group><credit_history><Interaction between age group and credit history to capture life-stage specific risk patterns>
   Reasoning: Credit risk assessment often depends on both life stage (age) and past credit behavior. This interaction feature could reveal patterns like younger applicants with poor credit history being higher risk, or older applicants with good credit being lower risk, which individual features might not capture.

3. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment status and loan duration to capture risk profiles>
   Reasoning: Employment stability combined with loan duration could indicate different risk profiles. For example, short-term employment with long loan duration might be riskier than stable employment with short duration. This interaction could help the model capture these nuanced risk patterns.

   Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_ratio has high variance (Std = 171.9925) and extreme values (range up to 2482.67). While log transformation helped, a square root transformation can provide additional normalization for extremely high values while maintaining a more interpretable scale than log.

2. <age_installment_interaction><cross><age_group><installment_commitment><Interaction between age group and installment commitment to capture age-specific affordability constraints>
   Reasoning: Different age groups have different financial capacities. The interaction between age groups and installment commitment could reveal patterns where certain age brackets are more sensitive to higher installment rates, which would be valuable for credit risk assessment.

3. <employment_duration_ratio><ratio><employment><duration><Ratio of employment duration to loan duration, indicating job stability relative to loan term>
   Reasoning: This feature captures whether the applicant's employment stability covers the loan duration. Someone employed for fewer years than the loan duration might represent higher risk, as their employment may not be stable enough to cover the entire repayment period.

   Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_ratio has high variance (std=171.99) and extreme values (range=25-2482). While log transform helped, a square root transform can provide an alternative normalization that handles extreme values differently, potentially capturing patterns the log transform might miss.

2. <age_installment_interaction><cross><age_group><installment_commitment><Interaction between age group and installment commitment to capture age-specific affordability constraints>
   Reasoning: Installment commitment represents the percentage of disposable income dedicated to loan repayment. Different age groups have different income levels and financial responsibilities. This interaction could reveal patterns where certain age groups are more sensitive to higher installment rates, improving risk assessment.

3. <employment_credit_history_interaction><cross><employment><credit_history><Interaction between employment status and credit history to capture job stability's impact on credit risk assessment>
