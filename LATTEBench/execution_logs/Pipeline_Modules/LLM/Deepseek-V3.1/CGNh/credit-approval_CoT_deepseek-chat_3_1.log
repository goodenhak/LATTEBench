2025-09-03 02:17:49,153 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtToIncomeRatio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio of Debt to Income, which may indicate financial stress and affect credit card approval>
   Reasoning: Debt and Income are both numerical features. Their ratio can provide a normalized measure of debt burden relative to income, which is a key factor in credit decisions.

2. <EmployedAndBankCustomer><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between employment status and bank customer status, as employed bank customers may have higher approval rates>
   Reasoning: Both Employed and BankCustomer are binary numerical features that represent important eligibility factors. Their interaction may capture synergistic effects that individually don't reveal.

3. <AgeBinned><bin><Age><Binned age groups to capture non-linear relationships between age and credit card approval>
   Reasoning: Age has a wide range (13.75-80.25) and its relationship with credit approval is likely non-linear. Binning can help capture different risk profiles across age groups.

2025-09-03 02:18:08,881 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeLog><log><Income><Log-transformed Income to handle skewness and make the distribution more normal, which can improve model performance>
   Reasoning: The Income feature has a very high standard deviation (3391.39) compared to its mean (797.41), indicating extreme right skewness. Log transformation can help normalize this distribution and reduce the influence of outliers, making the feature more useful for prediction.

2. <YearsEmployedSquared><square><YearsEmployed><Squared YearsEmployed to capture non-linear relationship with credit card approval, as both very low and very high employment duration might affect approval differently>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a median of 1.0 but range up to 20.0, suggesting a non-linear relationship with the target. Squaring this feature can help capture quadratic effects where both very short and very long employment durations might have different impacts on approval likelihood.

3. <EmployedPriorDefaultCross><cross><Employed><PriorDefault><Interaction between employment status and prior default history, as employed individuals with no prior defaults may have significantly higher approval rates>
   Reasoning: Both employment status and prior default history are likely important factors for credit approval. Their interaction could reveal meaningful patterns - for example, employed individuals with no prior defaults might be much more likely to be approved compared to unemployed individuals with prior defaults.

2025-09-03 02:18:28,544 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeSqrt><sqrt><Income><Square root of Income to reduce the effect of extreme values and handle skewness, making the feature more normally distributed for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The Income feature has a very high standard deviation (3391.39) compared to its mean (797.41), indicating significant right skew. Applying a square root transformation can help normalize the distribution and reduce the influence of outliers, which is particularly important for linear models and can benefit tree-based models as well.

2. <EmployedCreditScoreCross><cross><Employed><CreditScore><Interaction between employment status and credit score, as employed individuals with higher credit scores may have substantially higher approval rates than other combinations>
   Reasoning: Employment status and credit score are both important factors in credit decisions. Creating an interaction feature can capture synergistic effects where the combination of being employed and having a good credit score might be particularly favorable for approval, which might not be captured by considering these features independently.

3. <AgeDebtRatio><ratio><Age><Debt><Ratio of Age to Debt, which may indicate financial responsibility relative to age, with older individuals expected to handle debt more responsibly>
   Reasoning: Younger individuals with high debt might be viewed differently than older individuals with the same debt level. This ratio feature captures the relationship between age and debt burden, potentially providing a more nuanced indicator of financial stability than either feature alone.

   Reasoning: Income has an extremely high standard deviation (3391) compared to its median (5), indicating severe right-skewness and extreme outliers. Z-score transformation will normalize this distribution, helping models better learn from income patterns without being dominated by extreme values.

2. <EmployedYearsEmployedCross><cross><Employed><YearsEmployed><Interaction between employment status and years employed, as currently employed individuals with longer tenure may be significantly more creditworthy>
   Reasoning: Both employment status and job tenure are important individual predictors, but their interaction could be even more meaningful. Someone who is both employed AND has long tenure represents exceptional job stability, which is highly valued in credit assessments.

3. <CreditScoreLog><log><CreditScore><Log-transformed CreditScore to handle its right-skewed distribution (Q3=3, mean=2.46, but range up to 67), making the feature more normally distributed>
   Reasoning: CreditScore has most values clustered near 0 (median=0, Q3=3) but extends up to 67, creating a highly skewed distribution. Log transformation will compress the extreme values while preserving the meaningful differences in the lower range where most data points reside.

   - Reasoning: The Income feature is extremely right-skewed (Q3=345.25, mean=797.41, range up to 51100). Log transformation is a standard technique to handle such skewness. Using log(Income + 1) avoids issues with zero values (which are common, as seen in data examples) and makes the feature more suitable for linear models.

2. <EmployedCitizenCross><cross><Employed><Citizen><Interaction between employment status and citizenship, as employed citizens by birth may have different approval rates than temporary or other citizens>
   - Reasoning: Citizenship status (ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary) combined with employment status (0 or 1) could create meaningful interactions. For example, employed citizens by birth might be perceived as more stable and creditworthy compared to unemployed temporary citizens. This cross feature captures these potential non-additive effects.

3. <YearsEmployedBinned><bin><YearsEmployed><Binned YearsEmployed to capture non-linear relationships, as both very low and very high employment duration might affect approval differently>
   - Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a highly skewed distribution (Q1=0.165, median=1.0, Q3=2.5, mean=2.06, range up to 20). Binning can help capture non-linear patterns - for example, 0 years vs 1-2 years vs 5+ years might have different impacts on approval.

2025-09-03 02:19:34,163 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtLog1p><log><Debt><Log of (Debt + 1) to handle zero values and reduce skewness, similar to IncomeLog1p, as Debt distribution shows right skew (Q1=1.01, Median=2.75, Q3=7.0, Mean=4.65)>

3. <IncomeDebtRatio><ratio><Income><Debt><Ratio of Income to Debt, indicating financial capacity to service debt, which is a key factor in credit approval decisions>

Reasoning:
1. DebtLog1p: The Debt feature shows significant right skew (mean > median, Q3=7.0 but range up to 26.335). Log transformation will normalize the distribution and make it more suitable for linear models, similar to the successful IncomeLog1p transformation.

2. EmployedIndustryCross: This creates interaction terms between employment status and industry sector. Certain industries (like Financials or Utilities) may have more stable employment and higher incomes, making employed individuals in these sectors more creditworthy. The cross feature captures these nuanced relationships.

3. IncomeDebtRatio: This is a fundamental financial metric that lenders use to assess creditworthiness. A higher ratio indicates better ability to service debt obligations. Given that both Income and Debt are numerical and already scaled, this ratio provides a meaningful composite feature that directly relates to credit approval criteria.

   Reasoning: IncomeLog1p has already been log-transformed, but applying a square root transformation can further normalize the distribution and handle any remaining skewness, making it more suitable for linear models.

2. <EmployedPriorDefaultCross><cross><Employed><PriorDefault><Interaction between employment status and prior default history, as employed individuals with no prior defaults may have significantly higher approval rates than other combinations>
   Reasoning: This interaction feature captures the combined effect of employment status and credit history - employed individuals with clean credit records are likely much more creditworthy than unemployed individuals or those with prior defaults.

3. <IncomeDebtRatioLog1p><log><IncomeDebtRatio><Log transformation of IncomeDebtRatio to handle its extreme right skewness (mean=3148, std=49315) and make the distribution more normal for better model performance>
   Reasoning: IncomeDebtRatio shows extreme positive skewness with a very high standard deviation relative to its mean. A log transformation will compress the scale and make the distribution more normal, which is particularly important for linear models.

2025-09-03 02:20:13,485 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeDebtRatioSqrt><sqrt><IncomeDebtRatio><Square root of IncomeDebtRatio to further reduce extreme skewness while preserving the original relationship, providing an alternative transformation to the log version>
   Reasoning: IncomeDebtRatio has extreme right skewness (mean=3148, std=49315). While IncomeDebtRatioLog1p helps, trying a square root transformation provides an alternative way to handle skewness that might capture different patterns in the data and could be more effective for the downstream model.

2. <EmployedIncomeCross><cross><Employed><Income><Interaction between employment status and income, as employed individuals with higher income may have substantially different approval rates than unemployed individuals with similar income levels>
   Reasoning: Employment status and income are both crucial factors in credit approval. Creating an interaction feature between these two could capture synergistic effects where employed high-income individuals have much higher approval rates than unemployed individuals with the same income level.

3. <PriorDefaultIncomeDebtRatioCross><cross><PriorDefault><IncomeDebtRatio><Interaction between prior default status and income-to-debt ratio, as individuals with no prior defaults and high income-to-debt ratios may have exceptionally high approval rates compared to other combinations>
   Reasoning: Prior default history and financial capacity (income-to-debt ratio) are two of the most important factors in credit decisions. Creating an interaction between these could reveal that individuals with clean credit history AND strong financial capacity have dramatically higher approval rates than what either feature alone would predict.

   Reasoning: IncomeDebtRatio has extreme right skewness (mean=3148, std=49315). While IncomeDebtRatioLog1p was accepted, a square root transformation provides a different non-linear scaling that might capture relationships better for moderate values while still handling the skew.

2. <EmployedIncomeCross><cross><Employed><Income><Interaction between employment status and income, as employed individuals with higher income may have substantially different approval rates than unemployed individuals with similar income levels, capturing the combined effect of employment stability and earning capacity>
   Reasoning: Employment status and income are both crucial factors for credit approval. The interaction could reveal that employed high-income individuals have much higher approval rates than unemployed high-income individuals, which individual features might not capture effectively.

3. <PriorDefaultIncomeDebtRatioCross><cross><PriorDefault><IncomeDebtRatio><Interaction between prior default status and income-to-debt ratio, as individuals with no prior defaults and high income-to-debt ratios may have exceptionally high approval rates compared to other combinations, while those with prior defaults might need exceptionally high ratios to be approved>
   Reasoning: Prior default history is a strong negative factor, while high income-to-debt ratio is positive. The interaction could identify exceptional cases where good financial capacity (high ratio) might overcome prior default history, or where the absence of defaults combined with good ratios indicates very low risk.

2025-09-03 02:20:59,602 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeDebtRatioSqrt><sqrt><IncomeDebtRatio><Square root of IncomeDebtRatio to further reduce extreme skewness while preserving the original relationship, providing an alternative transformation to the log version that may capture different patterns for credit approval>
   
   Reasoning: The IncomeDebtRatio has extreme right skewness (mean=3148, std=49315). While IncomeDebtRatioLog1p was accepted, a square root transformation provides an alternative way to handle skewness that preserves more of the original magnitude relationships and may capture different patterns that could be beneficial for the model.

2. <EmployedIncomeCross><cross><Employed><Income><Interaction between employment status and income, as employed individuals with higher income may have substantially different approval rates than unemployed individuals with similar income levels, capturing the combined effect of employment stability and earning capacity>
   
   Reasoning: Employment status and income are both crucial factors in credit approval. An interaction between these features could reveal that employed individuals with even moderate incomes have much higher approval rates than unemployed individuals with similar incomes, which might not be captured by considering these features separately.

3. <PriorDefaultIncomeDebtRatioLog1pCross><cross><PriorDefault><IncomeDebtRatioLog1p><Interaction between prior default status and log-transformed income-to-debt ratio, as individuals with no prior defaults and high income-to-debt ratios may have exceptionally high approval rates compared to other combinations, while those with prior defaults might need exceptionally high ratios to be approved>
   
   Reasoning: PriorDefault is a strong predictor (median=1.0), and IncomeDebtRatioLog1p was accepted. Their interaction could capture that the effect of income-to-debt ratio on approval depends strongly on prior default history - those with clean histories may be approved with moderate ratios, while those with defaults may only be approved with exceptionally high ratios.
