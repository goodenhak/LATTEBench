   Reasoning: Squaring v_g_div_loc will non-linearly amplify higher complexity values, which are likely more predictive of defects. This captures the intuition that defect probability increases super-linearly with complexity.

2. <branchCount_halstead_volume_cross><cross><branchCount><v><Interaction between McCabe branch count and Halstead volume, capturing combined complexity>
   Reasoning: The interaction between structural complexity (branchCount) and algorithmic complexity (v) might reveal modules that are complex in both dimensions, which are high-risk for defects. Cross product captures this non-linear interaction.

3. <e_per_branch><divide><e><branchCount><Halstead effort per branch, measuring the cognitive load per decision point>
   Reasoning: Normalizing effort (e) by branch count (branchCount) creates a feature that represents the mental effort required per control flow decision. High values may indicate overly complex branches that are defect-prone.

These steps focus on creating non-linear transformations (squaring), meaningful interactions (cross), and normalized ratios (divide) that capture software engineering intuitions about defect causation.

Reasoning:
1. complexity_effort_ratio: This combines Halstead's effort (e) with McCabe's cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) to create a metric that measures how much development effort is required per decision path in the code. High values may indicate modules that are both complex and difficult to maintain.

2. branch_density: Normalizing branchCount by lOCode (lines of code) creates a density measure that accounts for module size. This helps identify modules with high control flow complexity relative to their size, which could be more prone to defects.

3. v_g_div_loc_squared: Squaring the existing v_g_div_loc feature amplifies the effect of modules with high cyclomatic complexity per line. This nonlinear transformation can help the model better capture the disproportionate impact of highly complex code segments on defect probability.

   Reasoning: This combines two normalized complexity measures (v_g_div_loc and e_per_loc) to create a feature that represents the interaction between structural complexity and development effort density per line of code. This could help identify modules where both complexity types are high simultaneously.

2. <branch_halstead_interaction><cross><branchCount><v><Interaction between McCabe branch count and Halstead volume, capturing combined control flow and algorithmic complexity>
   Reasoning: The cross operation creates interaction terms between branchCount (control flow complexity) and Halstead volume (algorithmic complexity). This non-linear combination might reveal modules with particularly complex control structures and algorithms that are more prone to defects.

3. <effort_per_cyclomatic_squared><divide><e><v_g_squared><Halstead effort per squared cyclomatic complexity, emphasizing the non-linear relationship between effort and complexity>
   Reasoning: Using squared cyclomatic complexity in the denominator amplifies the effect of highly complex modules, potentially better capturing the disproportionate effort required for highly complex code structures that are more likely to contain defects.

   Reasoning: This combines two normalized complexity measures (v_g_div_loc and e_per_loc) to create a feature that represents the interaction between structural complexity and development effort per line of code. This could help identify modules where both complexity types are high simultaneously.

2. <branch_halstead_ratio><divide><branchCount><v><Ratio of McCabe branch count to Halstead volume, measuring the relationship between control flow complexity and algorithmic complexity>
   Reasoning: This ratio captures the balance between different types of complexity. A high ratio might indicate modules with complex control flow but relatively simple algorithms, while a low ratio could indicate the opposite, both of which might be associated with different defect patterns.

3. <complexity_volatility><diff><v(g)><lag><v(g)><Difference in cyclomatic complexity between consecutive modules, capturing complexity changes that might indicate inconsistent coding practices>
   Reasoning: Tracking changes in complexity between modules could reveal patterns where sudden increases in complexity (potentially indicating rushed development or complex features) are associated with higher defect rates. The lag operation helps capture this temporal relationship.

   Reasoning: This combines two fundamental complexity metrics (McCabe cyclomatic complexity and Halstead effort) normalized per line of code. High values indicate modules where both structural complexity and development effort are concentrated, which are likely to be more defect-prone.

2. <log_halstead_volume><log><v><Logarithm of Halstead volume to handle skewness and reduce the effect of outliers in this heavily right-skewed feature>
   Reasoning: Halstead volume (v) has extreme outliers (range up to 7918.82) with high standard deviation. Applying logarithmic transformation will normalize the distribution and make the feature more suitable for linear models while preserving its predictive power.

3. <branch_cyclomatic_ratio><divide><branchCount><v(g)><Ratio of branch count to cyclomatic complexity, measuring the density of decision points within the control flow graph>
   Reasoning: Both branchCount and v(g) measure control flow complexity but from different perspectives. Their ratio can reveal interesting patterns about how complexity is distributed - modules with high branch count relative to cyclomatic complexity might indicate more complex decision structures that could be defect-prone.

2025-09-03 00:46:33,466 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <effort_per_cyclomatic><divide><e><v(g)><Halstead effort per cyclomatic complexity unit, measuring development effort required per decision path>
   Reasoning: This ratio combines Halstead's effort (e) with McCabe's cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) to measure how much cognitive effort is required per independent path through the code. Higher values may indicate more complex modules that are harder to understand and maintain, potentially correlating with defect proneness.

2. <log_halstead_volume><log><v><Logarithm of Halstead volume to handle skewness and reduce the effect of outliers in this heavily right-skewed feature>
   Reasoning: Halstead volume (v) has a wide range [0.0, 7918.82] with high standard deviation (530.9802), indicating significant right skew. Applying logarithmic transformation normalizes the distribution and makes the feature more suitable for linear models while preserving the relative ordering of values.

3. <branch_cyclomatic_ratio><divide><branchCount><v(g)><Ratio of branch count to cyclomatic complexity, measuring the density of decision points within the control flow graph>
   Reasoning: This ratio compares the actual number of branches (branchCount) with the theoretical maximum (v(g)). Values significantly different from 1 may indicate complex control flow structures (nested conditionals, loops) that could be more error-prone. This captures structural complexity beyond basic cyclomatic complexity.

   Reasoning: The Halstead effort (e) has an extremely wide range [0.0, 324803.51] with high standard deviation (18347.5219), indicating severe right skewness. Taking the logarithm will normalize the distribution and make the feature more suitable for linear models, similar to how log_loc handled skewness in line count.

2. <complexity_effort_ratio><divide><e><v(g)><Halstead effort per cyclomatic complexity unit, measuring development effort required per decision path>
   Reasoning: This creates a normalized measure of development effort relative to code complexity. A high ratio suggests that the code requires more effort than its complexity would indicate, which might signal poorly implemented or difficult-to-maintain code that could be more prone to defects.

3. <branch_cyclomatic_interaction><cross><branchCount><v(g)><Interaction between McCabe branch count and cyclomatic complexity, capturing combined control flow complexity>
   Reasoning: Both branchCount and v(g) measure different aspects of control flow complexity. Their interaction might reveal non-linear relationships where the combination of high branch count and high cyclomatic complexity creates particularly defect-prone code structures that aren't captured by either feature alone.

   Reasoning: The 'e' (Halstead effort) feature has an extremely wide range [0.0, 324803.51] with high standard deviation (18347.5219), indicating severe right-skewness. Taking the logarithm will normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. <complexity_density_product><multiply><v_g_div_loc><halstead_volume_per_line><Product of cyclomatic complexity density and Halstead volume density, capturing overall code complexity per line>
   Reasoning: Both v_g_div_loc and halstead_volume_per_line measure different aspects of code complexity normalized by size. Their product creates an interaction term that captures the combined effect of both McCabe and Halstead complexity metrics per line of code, which may better identify modules with high complexity across multiple dimensions.

3. <effort_per_complexity><divide><e><v(g)><Halstead effort per cyclomatic complexity unit, measuring development effort required per decision path>
   Reasoning: This ratio normalizes the Halstead effort by the cyclomatic complexity, creating a metric that measures the cognitive load per decision point in the code. Modules with high effort relative to their complexity may indicate poorly structured code that is more likely to contain defects, even if the raw complexity values aren't extremely high.
