2025-09-03 03:09:12,976 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <ELONGATEDNESS_SQUARED><square><ELONGATEDNESS><Squared ELONGATEDNESS to capture non-linear relationships and emphasize extreme elongation values.>
   Reasoning: Elongatedness is a key shape characteristic that likely has non-linear relationships with vehicle type. Squaring it will amplify higher values, potentially better distinguishing buses (which are highly elongated) from other vehicle types.

2. <SCALED_VARIANCE_DIFF><subtract><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><Difference between scaled variances along minor and major axes, capturing directional variance asymmetry.>
   Reasoning: The difference between variances along different axes may reveal shape orientation characteristics that the ratio alone doesn't capture. This could help distinguish vehicles with different aspect ratios and orientation patterns.

3. <COMPACTNESS_ELONGATEDNESS_RATIO><ratio><COMPACTNESS><ELONGATEDNESS><Ratio of compactness to elongatedness, capturing the trade-off between these two shape properties.>
   Reasoning: The interaction between compactness and elongatedness is likely important for vehicle classification. Buses tend to be elongated but not compact, while vans might be more compact but less elongated. This ratio could capture this fundamental shape trade-off.

2025-09-03 03:09:36,840 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and the accepted/rejected features, I need to create new features that capture meaningful shape relationships and non-linear patterns. The accepted features focus on squared terms, ratios, and multiplicative interactions, while the rejected ones were less effective.

Here are 3 potential next steps:

1. <PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO_SQUARED><square><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><Squared PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO to capture non-linear relationships in axis proportion asymmetry>
   - Reasoning: The aspect ratio between major and minor axes is fundamental to shape characterization. Squaring this value will emphasize extreme aspect ratios and capture quadratic relationships that might better distinguish between vehicle types with different elongation patterns.

2. <SCALED_VARIANCE_LOG_RATIO><log><SCALED_VARIANCE_RATIO><Logarithm of scaled variance ratio to normalize the distribution and handle skewness in shape asymmetry>
   - Reasoning: The scaled variance ratio has a range of [1.38, 3.59] with mean 2.26 and std 0.53. Taking the log will help normalize this distribution, making the feature more Gaussian-like, which often improves model performance for linear-based algorithms.

3. <COMPACTNESS_CIRCULARITY_PRODUCT><multiply><COMPACTNESS><CIRCULARITY><Product of COMPACTNESS and CIRCULARITY to capture interaction between these two complementary shape measures>
   - Reasoning: Both compactness and circularity measure how round or concentrated a shape is, but from different mathematical perspectives. Their product might reveal synergistic effects that are more discriminative than either feature alone for distinguishing vehicle silhouettes.

These features target different aspects of shape analysis: non-linear transformations of existing features, normalization of distributions, and multiplicative interactions between complementary shape descriptors.

2025-09-03 03:10:00,485 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SCALED_VARIANCE_LOG_DIFF><log><SCALED_VARIANCE_DIFF><Logarithm of the absolute difference between scaled variances along minor and major axes to handle skewness and normalize the distribution of variance asymmetry.>
   Reasoning: The difference between scaled variances (SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS - SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS) might have a skewed distribution. Taking the logarithm helps normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models while preserving the directional variance asymmetry information.

2. <COMPACTNESS_ELONGATEDNESS_PRODUCT><multiply><COMPACTNESS><ELONGATEDNESS><Product of COMPACTNESS and ELONGATEDNESS to capture the interaction between these two fundamental shape characteristics that often trade off against each other.>
   Reasoning: Vehicles with different silhouettes (OPEL, SAAB, BUS, VAN) will have different relationships between compactness (how tightly packed the shape is) and elongatedness (how stretched the shape is). This multiplicative interaction term can help capture vehicle-specific shape signatures.

3. <KURTOSIS_RATIO><ratio><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><Ratio of kurtosis values about major and minor axes, capturing differences in tail behavior and peakedness along different orientations.>
   Reasoning: Kurtosis measures the tailedness and peakedness of distributions. The ratio between kurtosis values along different axes could reveal distinctive patterns in vehicle silhouettes, particularly for distinguishing between more uniformly shaped vehicles (like buses) vs more irregular shapes (like vans with cargo areas).

Reasoning:
1. SCALED_VARIANCE_LOG_DIFF: The scaled variance ratio shows moderate skewness (range 1.38-3.59, mean 2.26, std 0.53). Applying log transformation can normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and potentially revealing patterns that were obscured by the original skewed distribution.

2. COMPACTNESS_ELONGATEDNESS_RATIO: These are two fundamental shape characteristics that often trade off against each other (compact vehicles vs elongated ones). The ratio could better distinguish between vehicle types like buses (more elongated) vs vans (more compact), capturing this important shape relationship more effectively than considering them separately.

3. KURTOSIS_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF: The kurtosis values show different ranges and distributions (major axis: 176-206, minor axis: 0-40). The difference between them could reveal orientation-specific shape characteristics that help distinguish vehicles viewed from different angles, as kurtosis captures peakedness and tail behavior of the silhouette distribution.

Reasoning:
1. SCALED_VARIANCE_LOG_DIFF: The scaled variance ratio shows moderate skewness (Q1=1.88, Q3=2.70, Mean=2.26). Applying a log transformation can normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and potentially revealing patterns that weren't apparent in the raw ratio.

2. KURTOSIS_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF: The kurtosis values show very different ranges (major axis: 176-206, minor axis: 0-40), suggesting significant asymmetry in peakedness. The difference between these values could capture distinctive shape characteristics that help differentiate vehicle types based on their tail behavior along different orientations.

3. COMPACTNESS_ELONGATEDNESS_RATIO: These two features represent fundamental trade-offs in shape properties - compact vehicles vs elongated ones. The ratio (rather than product) might better capture this inverse relationship and could be particularly useful for distinguishing between compact cars (OPEL/SAAB) vs elongated vehicles (BUS/VAN).

2025-09-03 03:11:14,356 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SCALED_VARIANCE_LOG_DIFF><log><SCALED_VARIANCE_RATIO><Logarithm of scaled variance ratio to normalize distribution and handle skewness in shape asymmetry, potentially improving linear model performance>
   Reasoning: The SCALED_VARIANCE_RATIO has a mean of 2.26 with std 0.53, indicating some skewness. Taking the logarithm can normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and potentially revealing patterns that distinguish vehicle types based on shape asymmetry.

2. <KURTOSIS_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF><subtract><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><Difference between kurtosis values about major and minor axes, capturing asymmetry in peakedness and tail behavior along different orientations>
   Reasoning: The kurtosis values show very different ranges (major axis: 176-206, minor axis: 0-40), suggesting they capture different aspects of shape distribution. The difference between them could highlight orientation-specific peakedness characteristics that distinguish vehicle types like buses (more symmetric) vs vans (more asymmetric).

3. <COMPACTNESS_ELONGATEDNESS_RATIO><ratio><COMPACTNESS><ELONGATEDNESS><Ratio of compactness to elongatedness, capturing the fundamental trade-off between these two important shape properties that distinguish vehicle types>
   Reasoning: COMPACTNESS (range 73-115) and ELONGATEDNESS (range 26-61) represent complementary shape characteristics. Their ratio captures the balance between overall compactness and elongation, which should be highly discriminative for vehicle types (e.g., buses are more compact relative to their elongation compared to vans).

Reasoning:
1. SCALED_VARIANCE_LOG_DIFF: The scaled variance ratio shows moderate skew (mean=2.26, std=0.53, range=1.38-3.59). Taking the logarithm can normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and potentially revealing non-linear relationships that weren't captured by the raw ratio.

2. KURTOSIS_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF: The kurtosis values show very different distributions (major axis: range=176-206, std=6.2; minor axis: range=0-40, std=8.9). The difference between these could capture important shape asymmetry information about how peaked or flat the silhouette appears from different orientations, which might help distinguish vehicle types.

3. COMPACTNESS_ELONGATEDNESS_RATIO: These two features represent fundamental, often opposing shape characteristics. Compact vehicles (like buses) would have high compactness and low elongatedness, while elongated vehicles (like vans) would show the opposite pattern. Their ratio could effectively capture this trade-off that distinguishes vehicle categories.

2025-09-03 03:12:06,125 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and the accepted/rejected features, I can see that shape asymmetry, compactness, and elongation interactions are important for vehicle classification. Here are 3 carefully considered next steps:

1. <SCALED_VARIANCE_ASYMMETRY_INDEX><ratio><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><Asymmetry index calculated as (minor_axis_variance - major_axis_variance)/(minor_axis_variance + major_axis_variance), capturing directional variance imbalance in a normalized range>
   - Reasoning: The existing SCALED_VARIANCE_RATIO was accepted, but an asymmetry index provides better normalization by bounding values between -1 and 1, making it more robust to outliers and easier for models to interpret.

2. <COMPACTNESS_ELONGATEDNESS_BALANCE><ratio><COMPACTNESS><ELONGATEDNESS><Ratio capturing the fundamental trade-off between compactness (how tightly packed) and elongatedness (how stretched out) of vehicle shapes>
   - Reasoning: While the product of elongation and rectangularity was accepted, the direct ratio between compactness and elongatedness captures a crucial shape property trade-off that distinguishes vehicles like buses (more elongated) from vans (more compact).

3. <KURTOSIS_ORIENTATION_DIFFERENTIAL><subtract><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><Difference in kurtosis between major and minor axes, capturing asymmetry in the peakedness and tail behavior of the silhouette distribution along different orientations>
   - Reasoning: Kurtosis measures the tailedness of distributions. Different vehicle types likely have different kurtosis patterns along their axes (e.g., buses may have more uniform kurtosis while vans might show directional differences in peakedness).

2025-09-03 03:12:30,971 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SCALED_VARIANCE_ASYMMETRY_INDEX><ratio><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><Asymmetry index calculated as (minor_axis_variance - major_axis_variance)/(minor_axis_variance + major_axis_variance), capturing directional variance imbalance in a normalized range [-1,1] that may better distinguish vehicle types>
   
   Reasoning: This creates a normalized asymmetry measure that puts the variance difference on a consistent scale, potentially making it easier for models to learn patterns. The [-1,1] range is more interpretable and could help distinguish between symmetric vs asymmetric vehicle shapes.

2. <COMPACTNESS_ELONGATEDNESS_BALANCE><ratio><COMPACTNESS><ELONGATEDNESS><Ratio capturing the fundamental trade-off between compactness (how tightly packed) and elongatedness (how stretched out) of vehicle shapes, which should be highly discriminative for different vehicle types>
   
   Reasoning: Compactness and elongatedness represent opposing shape characteristics. Their ratio captures the fundamental shape trade-off that distinguishes vehicles like buses (more elongated) from vans (more compact), potentially providing a powerful discriminative feature.

3. <KURTOSIS_ORIENTATION_DIFFERENTIAL><subtract><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><Difference in kurtosis between major and minor axes, capturing asymmetry in the peakedness and tail behavior of the silhouette distribution along different orientations, which may reveal subtle shape characteristics>
   
   Reasoning: Kurtosis differences along different axes can reveal subtle shape properties that aren't captured by variance alone. This could help distinguish vehicles with similar overall shapes but different distribution characteristics along different orientations.
