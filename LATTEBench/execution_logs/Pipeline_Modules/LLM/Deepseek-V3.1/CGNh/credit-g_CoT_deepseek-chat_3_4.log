   Reasoning: This creates a more accurate representation of monthly payment burden by incorporating the installment rate percentage of disposable income, which should be highly predictive of credit risk.

2. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment stability and loan duration, capturing risk patterns>
   Reasoning: Combining employment stability (categorical) with loan duration (numerical) through cross operation creates interaction terms that may reveal how employment status affects risk differently across various loan durations.

3. <savings_to_credit_ratio><ratio><savings_status><credit_amount><Ratio of savings status to credit amount, indicating financial buffer relative to loan size>
   Reasoning: This feature combines the categorical savings status with numerical credit amount using ratio operation (after appropriate encoding), creating a measure of how well the applicant's savings can cover the requested credit.

   Reasoning: Encoding categorical variables like savings_status into numerical values allows linear models to better capture the ordinal relationship between categories (e.g., <100, 100<=X<500, etc.) which likely correlates with creditworthiness.

2. <credit_history_encoded><label_encode><credit_history><Encoded credit history to numerical values to capture risk levels.>
   Reasoning: Credit history is a strong predictor of credit risk. Encoding it numerically (e.g., assigning higher values to riskier categories like delayed previously) helps models quantify the risk gradient.

3. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle skewness and reduce outlier impact.>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has high variance (std=2749) and is right-skewed (mean>median). Applying log transformation normalizes the distribution and makes models less sensitive to extreme values.

   Reasoning: This feature combines credit amount with savings capacity (encoded as numerical values) to create a risk indicator. Higher ratios suggest the loan amount is large relative to the applicant's savings, which might increase default risk.

2. <duration_employment_interaction><cross><duration><employment><Interaction between loan duration and employment stability to capture repayment capacity patterns>
   Reasoning: Employment stability combined with loan duration can reveal important risk patterns. Longer loans with unstable employment might be riskier, while shorter loans with stable employment might be safer.

3. <age_credit_amount_interaction><cross><age_group><credit_amount_per_installment><Interaction between age group and monthly payment burden to capture life-stage specific risk patterns>
   Reasoning: Different age groups may have different capacities to handle monthly payments. This interaction captures how payment burden affects different demographic segments differently.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between the loan amount and the client's savings capacity (encoded numerically). A high ratio may indicate over-leverage relative to savings, increasing default risk.

2. <duration_age_interaction><cross><duration><age_group><Interaction between loan duration and age group to capture life-stage specific repayment capacity patterns>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants may struggle with longer-term loans due to income instability, while older applicants might handle them better. This interaction captures non-linear risk patterns across age groups and loan terms.

3. <employment_credit_history_interaction><cross><employment><credit_history><Interaction between employment stability and credit history to capture compounded risk factors>
   Reasoning: Combining employment stability with credit history creates a powerful risk indicator. For example, unemployed applicants with poor credit history represent extremely high risk, while stable employment with good credit indicates low risk.

   Reasoning: Encoding categorical savings_status to numerical values will allow linear models to better capture the ordinal relationship between different savings levels, which is likely correlated with creditworthiness.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle right-skewness and make the distribution more normal for better model performance.>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range (338 to 15945) with mean > median, indicating right-skewness. Applying log transformation can reduce the impact of extreme values and improve model performance.

3. <employment_residence_interaction><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment stability and residence stability to capture combined stability factors for credit risk assessment.>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Their interaction may reveal patterns where stable employment combined with stable residence indicates lower credit risk, which individual features might not capture effectively.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between the loan amount and the client's savings capacity (encoded numerically). A high ratio suggests the client is borrowing significantly relative to their savings, which might indicate higher risk.

2. <employment_age_interaction><cross><employment><age_group><Interaction between employment stability and age group to capture career-stage specific risk patterns>
   Reasoning: Different age groups may have different risk profiles depending on their employment status. For example, unemployed young people might be higher risk than unemployed seniors with pensions. This interaction captures these nuanced patterns.

3. <duration_residence_interaction><cross><duration><residence_since><Interaction between loan duration and residence stability to assess commitment patterns>
   Reasoning: Clients who have lived longer at their residence might be more stable and better able to handle longer loan durations. This interaction helps capture whether the loan duration is appropriate given the client's residential stability.

2025-09-21 01:56:07,592 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status to numerical values to capture financial stability hierarchy from no savings to high savings>
   Reasoning: Savings status is an important indicator of financial stability. Encoding it numerically (e.g., no known savings=0, <100=1, 100<=X<500=2, 500<=X<1000=3, >=1000=4) creates an ordinal feature that can help the model understand the progressive nature of this financial stability indicator.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle right-skewness and normalize the distribution for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a right-skewed distribution (mean=3289, Q3=4122, but range up to 15945). Applying a log transformation will help normalize this distribution, reduce the impact of extreme values, and make the feature more suitable for linear models.

3. <employment_residence_stability><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment stability and residence stability to capture combined stability factors for credit risk assessment>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. The interaction between these factors may reveal patterns that individual features don't capture - for example, someone with long employment but short residence might have different risk characteristics than someone stable in both areas.

2025-09-21 01:56:26,568 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount_per_installment><installment_commitment><Ratio of monthly credit payment to installment commitment percentage, representing the actual income burden percentage>
   Reasoning: This feature combines the monthly payment amount with the installment commitment percentage to create a more accurate representation of the borrower's income burden. A higher ratio indicates a greater portion of income is dedicated to loan repayment, which is a strong predictor of default risk.

2. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status to numerical values to capture financial stability hierarchy from no savings to high savings>
   Reasoning: Encoding the savings_status categorical variable into numerical values (e.g., 0 for no known savings, 1 for <100, 2 for 100<=X<500, etc.) can help linear models better capture the ordinal relationship between savings levels and credit risk, which was missing from previous rejected attempts but is fundamentally important.

3. <employment_duration_residence_interaction><cross><employment_duration_interaction><residence_since><Interaction between employment-duration stability and residence stability to capture comprehensive stability patterns for credit risk assessment>
   Reasoning: This three-way interaction combines employment stability, loan duration, and residence stability - three key stability factors in credit assessment. It may reveal complex patterns where stable employment combined with longer residence and appropriate loan terms indicates lower risk.

2025-09-21 01:56:49,879 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status to numerical values to capture financial stability hierarchy from no savings to high savings>
   Reasoning: Savings status is a strong indicator of financial stability. Encoding it numerically (e.g., no known savings=0, <100=1, 100<=X<500=2, 500<=X<1000=3, >=1000=4) creates an ordinal feature that captures the progressive nature of savings levels, which should help the model better understand this relationship.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle right-skewness and normalize the distribution for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a right-skewed distribution (mean=3289, std=2749, max=15945). Applying a logarithmic transformation will reduce the impact of extreme values and create a more normal distribution, which often improves performance for linear models and tree-based models.

3. <employment_residence_stability><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment stability and residence stability to capture combined stability factors for credit risk assessment>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. The interaction between these two features may reveal patterns that individual features cannot capture - for example, someone with both long employment and long residence at the same address represents a very stable applicant, while someone unstable in both dimensions represents higher risk.

These features were selected because they address different aspects of credit risk assessment: financial stability (savings), data normalization (log transform), and stability patterns (employment-residence interaction). The savings encoding provides ordinal information, the log transform handles skewness, and the cross feature captures multidimensional stability patterns that could be predictive of creditworthiness.
