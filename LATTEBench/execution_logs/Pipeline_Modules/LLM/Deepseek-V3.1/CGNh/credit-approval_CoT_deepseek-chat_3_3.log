3. \<Employed_PriorDefault_cross\>\<cross\>\<Employed\>\<PriorDefault\>\<Interaction between employment status and prior default history, as employed status may mitigate default risk\>

Reasoning:  
1. YearsEmployed_sqrt: The YearsEmployed feature is highly right-skewed (median=1.0, mean=2.23). Applying a square root transformation will help normalize the distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and better capturing the non-linear relationship where initial years of employment matter more than additional years.
2. Debt_to_Income_ratio: This creates a fundamental financial ratio used in credit scoring. Lenders evaluate debt burden relative to income, so this engineered feature directly encodes this important relationship that isn't captured by either feature alone.
3. Employed_PriorDefault_cross: This interaction feature captures how employment status modifies the risk associated with prior defaults. An employed applicant with prior defaults might be viewed differently than an unemployed one, creating a more nuanced risk assessment.

   Reasoning: YearsEmployed is highly right-skewed (median=1.0, mean=2.23, Q3=2.625, max=20). Log transformation can normalize the distribution and better capture the diminishing marginal returns of additional work experience on creditworthiness.

2. <Debt_to_Income_ratio_plus1><ratio><Debt><Income_plus1><Debt to Income ratio with +1 smoothing to handle zero incomes>
   Reasoning: The original Debt_to_Income_ratio was rejected, likely due to division by zero issues (many zero incomes: median=5.5, Q1=0). Adding 1 to Income before calculating the ratio prevents division by zero and handles the many low-income cases while preserving the debt-to-income relationship.

3. <Employed_CreditScore_cross><cross><Employed><CreditScore><Interaction between employment status and credit score, as employment may amplify the positive effect of good credit>
   Reasoning: Employment status (Employed) and credit score (CreditScore) are both important predictors. Their interaction could capture how being employed enhances the positive impact of a good credit score, or how unemployment diminishes it. This is different from the previously rejected employment-default interaction.

2025-09-03 02:30:13,854 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Debt_to_Income_log_ratio><ratio><Debt><Income><Log ratio of Debt to Income to handle extreme values and create a more normally distributed feature for credit assessment>
   Reasoning: The original Debt_to_Income_ratio was rejected, but taking the log of this ratio can handle the extreme values in Income (which has mean=1217 but std=6461, indicating heavy skew) and create a more normally distributed feature that better captures the relationship between debt and income for creditworthiness.

2. <Employed_Age_cross><cross><Employed><Age><Interaction between employment status and age, as the impact of employment on credit approval may differ across age groups>
   Reasoning: Employment status is crucial for credit approval, but its effect might be different for younger vs older applicants. Younger employed applicants might be seen as more stable than unemployed ones, while older unemployed applicants might be viewed more negatively. This interaction captures that nuanced relationship.

3. <CreditScore_binned><bin><CreditScore><Binned CreditScore to capture non-linear relationships and reduce the impact of extreme values in the scaled feature>
   Reasoning: CreditScore has a highly skewed distribution (Q1=0, Median=0, Q3=3, but range=0-67) with many zeros and a long tail. Binning can help capture the non-linear effects where small increases at the low end might be more significant than large increases at the high end, while also making the feature more robust to outliers.

3. <CreditScore_Income_ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Income><Ratio of CreditScore to Income, capturing the relationship between creditworthiness and earning capacity>

Reasoning:
1. Income has an extremely high standard deviation (6461) compared to its median (5.5), indicating severe right skew. Log transformation will help normalize this distribution and make the feature more useful for linear models while handling the extreme outliers.
2. The interaction between age, employment status and income could reveal complex patterns - for example, older employed individuals with high income might be much more creditworthy, while young unemployed individuals with low income would be high risk. This three-way cross captures these nuanced relationships.
3. Creating a ratio between CreditScore and Income could provide a normalized measure of creditworthiness relative to earning power. This might be particularly informative since a high credit score with low income might indicate different risk than a high credit score with high income.

2025-09-03 02:30:52,346 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Income_log><log><Income><Log transform of Income to handle extreme skew and create a more normally distributed feature for credit assessment>
   Reasoning: The Income feature has an extremely high standard deviation (6461.45) compared to its median (5.5), indicating severe right skew. Log transformation can normalize this distribution and make the feature more suitable for linear models, while reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. <YearsEmployed_Employed_cross><cross><YearsEmployed><Employed><Interaction between years of employment and current employment status, as the value of experience may differ for currently employed vs unemployed applicants>
   Reasoning: The combination of employment history (YearsEmployed) and current employment status (Employed) could provide valuable insights. Someone with many years of experience but currently unemployed might have different credit risk than someone with little experience who is employed.

3. <CreditScore_Age_ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Age><Ratio of CreditScore to Age, capturing how creditworthiness develops relative to life experience and age progression>
   Reasoning: This ratio could help normalize credit scores by age, as younger applicants typically have lower credit scores due to shorter credit histories. This creates a fairer comparison across age groups and might reveal applicants who have better credit than expected for their age.

   Reasoning: The Income feature has an extremely high standard deviation (6461.45) compared to its median (5.5), indicating severe positive skew. A log transformation will help normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. <YearsEmployed_Employed_cross><cross><YearsEmployed><Employed><Interaction between years of employment and current employment status, as the value of experience differs significantly for currently employed vs unemployed applicants>
   Reasoning: The interaction between years of experience and current employment status could be highly predictive. Someone with many years of experience but currently unemployed might represent a different risk profile than someone with few years but currently employed. This captures the nuanced relationship between experience history and current employment situation.

3. <CreditScore_Income_ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Income><Ratio of CreditScore to Income, capturing the relationship between creditworthiness and earning capacity relative to each other>
   Reasoning: This creates a normalized metric that combines two important financial indicators. A high credit score with low income might indicate different risk than low credit score with high income. This ratio captures the balance between these two factors in a single informative feature.

2025-09-03 02:31:28,370 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Income_log><log><Income><Log transform of Income to handle extreme positive skew and create a more normally distributed feature for credit assessment>
   - Reasoning: Income has an extremely high standard deviation (6461.45) compared to its mean (1217.36), indicating severe positive skew. Log transformation can help normalize this distribution and make the feature more useful for linear models.

2. <YearsEmployed_Employed_cross><cross><YearsEmployed><Employed><Interaction between years of employment and current employment status, as the value of experience differs significantly for currently employed vs unemployed applicants>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between years of employment and current employment status could be highly predictive. Someone with many years of experience who is currently employed might be much more creditworthy than someone with similar experience who is currently unemployed.

3. <CreditScore_Income_ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Income><Ratio of CreditScore to Income, capturing the relationship between creditworthiness and earning capacity relative to each other>
   - Reasoning: This ratio could capture the balance between creditworthiness (CreditScore) and ability to pay (Income). A high credit score relative to income might indicate responsible financial management, while a low ratio might suggest credit risk despite decent income.

3. <Employed_CreditScore_cross><cross><Employed><CreditScore><Interaction between employment status and credit score, as employment may amplify the positive effect of good credit>

Reasoning:
1. Income_log: The Income feature has extreme positive skew (Mean=1217.36, Q3=433.0, but range up to 100,000) with very high standard deviation (6461.45). A log transform will normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers that could dominate the prediction.

2. YearsEmployed_log: YearsEmployed is heavily right-skewed (Q1=0.165, Median=1.0, Q3=2.625, but range up to 20.0). A log transform will better capture the diminishing returns of additional years of experience while still preserving the meaningful differences between low values (e.g., 0 vs 1 year is more significant than 10 vs 11 years).

3. Employed_CreditScore_cross: This interaction feature captures how the relationship between credit score and approval likelihood differs based on employment status. Employed individuals with good credit scores may be significantly more likely to be approved, while the same credit score might be less predictive for unemployed applicants. This non-additive effect could be crucial for the prediction task.

2025-09-03 02:32:09,798 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Income_log><log><Income><Log transform of Income to handle extreme positive skew and create a more normally distributed feature for credit assessment>
   Reasoning: The Income feature has an extremely high standard deviation (6461.45) compared to its median (5.5), indicating severe positive skew. Log transformation is a standard technique to normalize such distributions, which can help linear models better capture the relationship between income and credit approval.

2. <YearsEmployed_Employed_cross><cross><YearsEmployed><Employed><Interaction between years of employment and current employment status, as the value of experience differs significantly for currently employed vs unemployed applicants>
   Reasoning: The interaction between years of experience and current employment status could be highly predictive. Someone with many years of experience but currently unemployed might represent a different risk profile than someone with few years but currently employed. This captures the nuanced relationship between experience history and current employment situation.

3. <CreditScore_Income_ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Income><Ratio of CreditScore to Income, capturing the relationship between creditworthiness and earning capacity relative to each other>
   Reasoning: This ratio creates a normalized metric that combines two crucial financial indicators. It measures how much creditworthiness (credit score) an applicant has relative to their income level, which could be more predictive than either feature alone, especially for assessing debt repayment capacity.

2025-09-03 02:32:28,298 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Income_log><log><Income><Log transform of Income to handle extreme positive skew and create a more normally distributed feature for credit assessment>
   Reasoning: Income has an extremely high standard deviation (6461) compared to its median (5.5), indicating severe positive skew. Log transformation can normalize this distribution and make the feature more useful for linear models, while also handling the extreme income outliers seen in the data examples.

2. <Employed_PriorDefault_cross><cross><Employed><PriorDefault><Interaction between current employment status and prior default history, as employment may mitigate the impact of prior defaults on credit approval>
   Reasoning: Both employment status and prior defaults are crucial for credit assessment. An interaction term could capture how employment status modifies the negative impact of prior defaults - employed applicants with prior defaults might be viewed more favorably than unemployed ones with similar default history.

3. <CreditScore_Income_ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Income><Ratio of CreditScore to Income, capturing how creditworthiness relates to earning capacity - higher ratios indicate better credit relative to income>
   Reasoning: This creates a normalized metric that combines two key financial indicators. It could help identify applicants who have good credit scores relative to their income level, which might be particularly valuable for assessing creditworthiness across different income brackets.
