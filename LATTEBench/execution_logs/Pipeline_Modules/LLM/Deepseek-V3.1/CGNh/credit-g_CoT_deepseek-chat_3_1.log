2025-09-03 00:01:23,057 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <checking_status_encoded><label_encode><checking_status><Encoded checking_status from categorical to numerical>
   Reasoning: Converting categorical features like 'checking_status' to numerical via label encoding allows linear models to utilize this information. The status of the checking account is likely highly predictive of credit risk.

2. <credit_amount_duration_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Ratio of credit amount to loan duration, indicating monthly burden>
   Reasoning: The ratio of credit amount to duration approximates the monthly payment burden. A higher ratio might indicate greater risk, as larger payments relative to the loan term could strain the borrower's finances.

3. <age_squared><square><age><Squared age feature to capture potential non-linear relationships with credit risk>
   Reasoning: Age often has a non-linear relationship with financial behavior. Squaring age can help models capture quadratic trends, such as middle-aged individuals being more stable and lower risk.

2025-09-03 00:01:55,212 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle skewness and linearize relationships>
   - Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range (250 to 18424) and high standard deviation (2873.98), indicating potential skewness. Applying a logarithmic transformation can normalize the distribution and help linear models better capture its relationship with the target variable.

2. <age_duration_interaction><multiply><age><duration><Interaction between age and duration to capture combined effect on credit risk>
   - Reasoning: Both age and duration are important numerical features. Their interaction might reveal patterns where older applicants with longer loan durations have different risk profiles than younger applicants with shorter durations, capturing non-additive effects.

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings_status from categorical to numerical for model compatibility>
   - Reasoning: While we have encoded checking_status and credit_history, savings_status remains categorical. Encoding it numerically will make it usable in linear models and allow for better integration with other numerical features in the dataset.

   Reasoning: Multiplying these two encoded features creates an interaction term that may reveal how checking account status and credit history combine to influence credit risk. This could capture scenarios where good credit history with poor checking status (or vice versa) have different risk profiles than expected.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle skewness and create more normally distributed feature>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range (250-18424) with high standard deviation, indicating significant skewness. Applying log transformation can normalize the distribution and make relationships with the target more linear, improving model performance.

3. <residence_since_job_interaction><cross><residence_since><job><Interaction between residence stability and job type to capture employment stability patterns>
   Reasoning: Combining how long someone has lived at their current residence with their job type could reveal important stability patterns. Longer residence with stable employment might indicate lower risk, while frequent moves with unstable employment might indicate higher risk.

   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range (250 to 18424) with a mean of 3289.64 and std of 2873.98, indicating significant right skew. Applying a log transformation can normalize the distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and potentially improving model performance by reducing the influence of extreme values.

2. <age_duration_interaction><multiply><age><duration><Interaction between age and duration to capture combined effect on credit risk>
   Reasoning: Both age and duration are important numerical features that may have synergistic effects on credit risk. Older applicants with longer loan durations might represent different risk profiles than younger applicants with similar durations. This interaction term can help capture these complex relationships that individual features might miss.

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings_status from categorical to numerical for model compatibility>
   Reasoning: While we have encoded checking_status and credit_history, savings_status remains categorical. Converting it to numerical through label encoding will make it compatible with more models and algorithms, and could potentially reveal ordinal relationships in savings account status that might be predictive of creditworthiness.

   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a high standard deviation (2873.98) relative to its mean (3289.64), indicating significant skewness. Applying a logarithmic transformation can normalize the distribution and potentially improve model performance by handling outliers more effectively.

2. <age_duration_interaction><multiply><age><duration><Interaction between age and loan duration to capture combined effect on repayment capacity>
   Reasoning: Both age and duration are important numerical features for credit risk assessment. Their interaction might reveal patterns where older applicants with longer loan terms or younger applicants with shorter terms have different risk profiles, capturing non-additive effects.

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings_status from categorical to numerical for better model interpretation and compatibility>
   Reasoning: Savings status is an important financial stability indicator. Encoding it numerically (similar to what was done for checking_status and credit_history) will make it more accessible to linear models and allow for better comparison of different savings levels.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount_log: The credit_amount feature has high skewness (Std = 2873.98, range = [250, 18424]). Applying log transformation helps normalize the distribution and handle outliers, which often improves model performance with linear algorithms.
2. age_duration_product: Both age and duration are important numerical features. Their product captures the combined effect where older applicants with longer loan durations might have different risk profiles than younger applicants with shorter durations.
3. checking_status_savings_status_interaction: While checking_savings_interaction exists, creating a simpler cross between the original categorical features (before encoding) might capture different patterns and provide additional signal to the model about combined financial stability.

   - Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range [250, 18424] with high std (2873.98), indicating significant skewness. Applying log transformation can normalize the distribution and potentially improve model performance by reducing the influence of extreme values.

2. <age_duration_interaction><multiply><age><duration><Interaction between age and loan duration to capture combined effect on repayment capacity>
   - Reasoning: Both age and duration are important numerical features. Their interaction may reveal patterns where older applicants with longer loan durations have different risk profiles than younger applicants with similar durations, capturing non-additive effects.

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings_status from categorical to numerical for better model interpretation and compatibility>
   - Reasoning: Savings status is an important financial stability indicator. Encoding it numerically (similar to checking_status_encoded and credit_history_encoded) will make it compatible with models that require numerical inputs and may capture the ordinal relationship between savings categories.

2025-09-03 00:03:41,827 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings_status from categorical to numerical for better model interpretation and compatibility>
   Reasoning: Savings status is an important financial indicator that should be encoded numerically for better model consumption. The label encoding will convert the ordinal categories (<100, 100<=X<500, 500<=X<1000, >=1000, no known savings) into numerical values that can capture the progressive nature of savings amounts.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle skewness and create more normally distributed feature>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range (250-18424) with high standard deviation, indicating significant skewness. Applying log transformation will help normalize the distribution and make the feature more suitable for linear models, potentially improving prediction performance.

3. <age_duration_interaction><multiply><age><duration><Interaction between age and loan duration to capture combined effect on repayment capacity>
   Reasoning: Both age and duration are important numerical features for credit risk assessment. Their interaction may reveal patterns not captured by individual features - for example, older applicants with longer loan durations might have different risk profiles than younger applicants with similar durations. This multiplicative interaction could capture non-linear relationships.

   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range [250, 18424] with high std (2873.9759), indicating significant skewness. Log transformation can normalize the distribution and help linear models better capture relationships with the target variable.

2. <age_duration_interaction><multiply><age><duration><Interaction between age and loan duration to capture combined effect on repayment capacity>
   Reasoning: Both age and duration are important numerical features. Older applicants with longer loan durations might have different risk profiles than younger applicants with shorter terms. This multiplicative interaction can capture non-linear relationships that individual features might miss.

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings_status from categorical to numerical for better model interpretation and compatibility>
   Reasoning: Savings status is an important categorical feature with financial stability implications. Encoding it numerically (similar to checking_status_encoded and credit_history_encoded) will make it compatible with more algorithms and potentially reveal ordinal relationships that one-hot encoding might obscure.
