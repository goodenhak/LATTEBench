Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

Features:

   Reasoning: This ratio combines Halstead's volume (effort) with McCabe's design complexity (iv(g)). High volume per complexity unit could indicate code that is unnecessarily complex for its logical structure, potentially increasing defect likelihood.

2. <log_halstead_effort><log><e><Log-transformed Halstead effort to handle extreme skew and reduce the influence of outliers>
   Reasoning: The 'e' (effort) feature has an extremely wide range (0 to 130k+) with high standard deviation. Log transformation will normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the undue influence of extreme values.

   Reasoning: This ratio compares the actual branch count with the theoretical cyclomatic complexity. A significant discrepancy might indicate irregular control flow patterns that could be associated with defect-prone code sections.

2025-09-21 02:32:42,572 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_halstead_volume><log><v><Log-transformed Halstead volume to handle extreme skew and reduce the influence of outliers, similar to log_loc but for code volume metric>
   Reasoning: Halstead volume (v) has a very wide range [0.0, 3820.09] with high standard deviation (469.3167), indicating significant skew. Log transformation can normalize this distribution and make relationships with the target more linear, similar to how log_loc was created for the loc feature.

2. <complexity_effort_ratio><divide><e><v(g)><Effort per cyclomatic complexity unit, measuring how much coding effort is expended per decision point which may indicate inefficient or error-prone code structures>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio that normalizes the Halstead effort (e) by the cyclomatic complexity (v(g)). High effort per complexity point might indicate convoluted code that is more likely to contain defects, while very low values might indicate overly simplistic implementations.

3. <comment_density><divide><lOComment><loc><Ratio of comments to total lines of code, measuring documentation density which may correlate with code quality and lower defect rates>
   Reasoning: While lOComment has most values at 0 (median=0, Q3=0), creating a density metric relative to code size could reveal meaningful patterns. Well-documented code might have fewer defects, and this ratio normalizes the comment count by the overall code size.

Reasoning:
1.  complexity_density: This feature was previously rejected but shows promise. It measures coding effort (Halstead volume) per unit of design complexity (iv(g)). High values could indicate overly complex implementations for simple logical structures, which are often error-prone.
2.  log_halstead_effort: The raw e (Halstead effort) feature is likely extremely right-skewed, as evidenced by the huge range and standard deviation of related features like complexity_effort_ratio and t. A log transform is a standard technique to normalize such distributions, making the relationship with the target variable easier for a model to learn.
3.  branch_complexity_ratio: This creates a ratio between the actual number of branches (branchCount) and the theoretical maximum cyclomatic complexity (v(g)). A value significantly different from 1 (either higher or lower) could indicate unusual control flow structures that might be associated with defects (e.g., overly nested code or missing branches).

Reasoning:
1. log_halstead_effort: The original 'e' (Halstead effort) has extreme skew (range up to 7258.83 with Q3=125.85 and mean=265.04). Log transformation is highly appropriate to handle this skew, similar to how log_loc improved the loc feature. This should make the feature more normally distributed and improve model performance.

2. complexity_density: This creates a ratio of Halstead volume (v) to McCabe design complexity (iv(g)). It measures how much code volume exists per unit of design complexity, which could indicate overly complex or dense code structures that might be more error-prone. This combines two different complexity metrics into a single informative ratio.

3. branch_count_to_loc_ratio: This measures the density of branching statements in the code. A higher ratio means more control flow complexity per line of code, which could indicate more complex logic that might be more susceptible to defects. This provides a normalized measure of branching complexity relative to code size.

2025-09-21 02:33:45,177 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_complexity_effort_ratio><log><complexity_effort_ratio><Log-transformed complexity effort ratio to handle extreme skew and reduce the influence of outliers, making the distribution more normal for modeling>
   Reasoning: The complexity_effort_ratio has a very wide range (0 to 12266) with high standard deviation (1157.7), indicating extreme skew. Log transformation is highly effective for such heavy-tailed distributions, similar to how log_loc was created from loc. This should help linear models better capture relationships with this feature.

2. <branch_density><divide><branchCount><loc><Number of branches per line of code, measuring control flow complexity concentration which may be a stronger defect predictor than absolute counts>
   Reasoning: While branchCount alone measures complexity, normalizing it by loc creates a density metric that accounts for code size. This could reveal modules with unusually high control flow complexity relative to their size, which might be more defect-prone. This was previously rejected as branch_count_to_loc_ratio but with a different description - refining the description to focus on density might yield better results.

3. <halstead_volume_to_cyclomatic><divide><v><v(g)><Halstead volume per cyclomatic complexity unit, measuring code volume per decision point which may indicate overly complex or dense code structures>
   Reasoning: This combines two fundamental code metrics: Halstead volume (v) measures code size/complexity, while cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) measures control flow complexity. Their ratio indicates how much code is written per decision point - high values might suggest verbose or inefficient implementations, while low values might indicate dense, complex code. Both extremes could correlate with defects.

2025-09-21 02:34:05,625 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_complexity_effort_ratio><log><complexity_effort_ratio><Log-transformed complexity effort ratio to handle extreme skew and reduce the influence of outliers, making the distribution more normal for modeling>
   - Reasoning: The complexity_effort_ratio has an extremely wide range [0.0, 12266.64] with high standard deviation (1157.73), indicating severe right skew. Log transformation is effective for handling such skewed distributions, making the feature more normally distributed and reducing the influence of extreme values that could disproportionately affect model performance.

2. <branch_density><divide><branchCount><loc><Number of branches per line of code, measuring control flow complexity concentration which may be a stronger defect predictor than absolute counts>
   - Reasoning: While branchCount alone measures absolute complexity, normalizing it by loc creates a density metric that accounts for code size. This could better capture complexity concentration, as a module with many branches in few lines might be more defect-prone than one with the same number of branches spread across more lines.

3. <complexity_effort_per_branch><divide><complexity_effort_ratio><branchCount><Effort per branch point, measuring coding effort expended per control flow decision which may indicate particularly complex or error-prone branching structures>
   - Reasoning: This combines two complexity metrics to create a more refined feature. It measures how much effort is associated with each branch point, potentially identifying modules where branching decisions are particularly complex or require disproportionate coding effort, which could correlate with higher defect rates.

   Reasoning: The branch_complexity_ratio has a median of 0.999999000001 (essentially 1.0), suggesting that well-structured code should have this ratio close to 1.0. Measuring deviation from this ideal value could capture code structures that don't align well with their theoretical complexity, which might be more defect-prone.

2. <effort_density_ratio><divide><complexity_effort_ratio><halstead_volume_per_line><Ratio of complexity effort to code density, identifying modules where high effort is concentrated in dense code which may indicate particularly problematic areas>
   Reasoning: Both complexity_effort_ratio and halstead_volume_per_line are measures of code complexity/concentration. Their ratio could help identify modules where high coding effort is combined with high code density - a potentially dangerous combination that might indicate overly complex, hard-to-maintain code sections.

3. <normalized_comment_impact><multiply><comment_density><log_loc><Comment density weighted by code size, capturing the combined effect of documentation and code volume on defect likelihood>
   Reasoning: While comment_density alone has limited variability (mostly 0), multiplying it by log_loc (which represents code size) creates a feature that gives more weight to comments in larger modules. This could better capture the protective effect of documentation, especially in larger codebases where documentation might be more valuable.

   - Reasoning: Halstead volume (v) is a fundamental metric in software quality prediction that measures program complexity based on operators and operands. The raw values likely have a skewed distribution similar to other code metrics. Log transformation will normalize the distribution and reduce the impact of extreme outliers, making it more suitable for linear models and improving model stability.

2. <complexity_density><divide><v><iv(g)><Halstead volume per design complexity unit, measuring the effort per logical decision point which may indicate error-prone code>
   - Reasoning: This combines Halstead volume (overall code complexity) with McCabe's design complexity (iv(g)) which measures the complexity of the program's control flow. A high ratio suggests that the code has high complexity relative to its logical structure, potentially indicating convoluted or difficult-to-maintain code that might be more defect-prone. This interaction could capture non-linear relationships.

3. <branch_complexity_alignment><multiply><branch_complexity_ratio><v(g)><Product of branch complexity ratio and cyclomatic complexity, measuring how structural alignment interacts with overall complexity in predicting defects>
   - Reasoning: The branch_complexity_ratio measures how well the actual branching aligns with theoretical complexity, while v(g) measures the overall cyclomatic complexity. Their product could identify modules where both high complexity AND poor structural alignment occur simultaneously - a potentially strong indicator of defect-prone code that neither feature alone would capture as effectively.

2025-09-21 02:35:08,754 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_halstead_volume_per_line><log><halstead_volume_per_line><Log-transformed Halstead volume per line to handle skew and reduce the influence of extreme values, making the distribution more normal for modeling>
   - Reasoning: The halstead_volume_per_line feature has a wide range [0.0, 48.58] and relatively high standard deviation (5.92). Log transformation can help handle the skewness and make the distribution more normal, which often improves model performance with linear algorithms and helps with outlier sensitivity.

2. <complexity_interaction><multiply><v(g)><iv(g)><Interaction between McCabe's cyclomatic complexity and design complexity, capturing synergistic effects that may better predict defects than either feature alone>
   - Reasoning: Both v(g) and iv(g) are McCabe complexity metrics that measure different aspects of code complexity. Their interaction term could capture non-linear relationships where the combination of high cyclomatic complexity and high design complexity is particularly problematic for defect proneness.

3. <effort_code_density_ratio><divide><complexity_effort_ratio><halstead_volume_per_line><Ratio of complexity effort to code density, identifying modules where high effort is concentrated in dense code which may indicate particularly problematic and error-prone areas>
   - Reasoning: This combines two important code quality metrics - the effort per complexity unit and the code density. Modules with both high effort requirements and dense code are likely to be particularly defect-prone, as this suggests complex logic packed into compact code.
