3. <age_duration_interaction><multiply><age><duration><Interaction between age and loan duration to capture combined effect on credit risk>

Reasoning:
1. The credit_to_income_ratio combines credit_amount and installment_commitment to create a more meaningful feature that represents the actual debt burden relative to the borrower's income capacity. This is likely to be more predictive than either feature alone.

2. Employment_duration_encoded converts the categorical employment feature into numerical values, allowing linear models to better capture the ordinal relationship between employment duration categories and creditworthiness.

3. Age_duration_interaction creates a multiplicative term between age and loan duration, which may reveal non-linear relationships where the risk profile changes differently for different age groups across loan durations.

2025-09-21 01:58:47,088 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_to_income_ratio_zscore><zscore><credit_to_income_ratio><Standardized credit-to-income ratio to normalize scale and identify outliers>
   Reasoning: The credit_to_income_ratio has extremely high variance (std=1946.5) and range. Standardizing this feature will help models better handle its distribution and identify extreme values that might indicate high-risk applicants.

2. <employment_duration_risk_score><target_encoding><employment><credit_history><Encoded employment duration weighted by credit history risk to capture employment stability impact on creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Combining employment stability (employment) with credit history risk (credit_history) through target encoding creates a feature that captures how employment duration interacts with past credit behavior. Longer employment with good credit history should indicate lower risk.

3. <property_employment_interaction><cross><property_magnitude><employment><Interaction between property ownership and employment status to assess financial stability>
   Reasoning: Property ownership (real estate vs none) and employment status (unemployed vs long-term) are both strong indicators of financial stability. Their interaction may reveal synergistic effects on credit approval decisions.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the monthly burden of the credit, which may be more informative than the total amount or duration alone. A higher ratio indicates a larger credit per month, potentially increasing risk.

2. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status categories to numerical values for ordinal relationship modeling>
   Reasoning: Savings status has an inherent ordinal relationship (e.g., no known savings < <100 < 100<=X<500 < 500<=X<1000 < >=1000). Label encoding preserves this ordering better than one-hot encoding.

   - Reasoning: This creates a more direct measure of monthly payment burden by dividing the total credit amount by the installment commitment percentage. This could better capture affordability than the existing credit_to_income_ratio.

2. <employment_duration_risk_score><target_encoding><employment><credit_history><Employment duration risk score weighted by credit history quality>
   - Reasoning: Target encoding employment duration with credit history as the target captures how different employment stability levels correlate with credit risk, providing a more nuanced feature than simple label encoding.

3. <property_employment_interaction><cross><property_magnitude><employment><Interaction between property ownership level and employment stability>
   - Reasoning: Combining property ownership (wealth indicator) with employment status (income stability) through cross operation creates a powerful composite feature that captures financial security from multiple dimensions.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle skewness and normalize the distribution for better model performance>

3. <job_housing_interaction><cross><job><housing><Interaction between job type and housing situation to assess combined stability factors affecting credit risk>
   Reasoning: Both job stability and housing situation are important indicators of financial stability. Their interaction may reveal patterns where certain job-housing combinations have higher/lower credit approval rates than expected from individual features alone.

   Reasoning: Combining checking and savings status provides a more complete picture of an applicant's financial liquidity, which is crucial for credit risk assessment. The cross operation creates interaction terms that capture combined effects that individual features might miss.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to normalize distribution and reduce skewness for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount has a wide range (276-18424) with mean (3166) much higher than median (2264), indicating right skew. Log transformation helps normalize this distribution, making it easier for models to learn patterns and reducing the influence of extreme values.

3. <job_housing_stability_index><cross><job><housing><Interaction between job type and housing situation to create a stability index affecting creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Employment stability (captured by job type) combined with housing stability (own/rent/free) provides a more comprehensive view of an applicant's overall financial stability. This interaction feature may reveal patterns where certain job-housing combinations are more creditworthy than others.

2025-09-21 02:00:35,224 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <checking_savings_liquidity_index><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Combined liquidity index from checking and savings account status to assess overall financial stability>
   Reasoning: The interaction between checking and savings accounts can provide a more comprehensive view of an applicant's liquidity. This combined measure may better predict creditworthiness than either feature alone, as it captures the overall financial buffer available to the applicant.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to normalize distribution and handle skewness for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a wide range (276-18424) and high standard deviation (2756), indicating significant skewness. Applying a log transformation can normalize the distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme values.

3. <job_housing_stability_score><cross><job><housing><Interaction between job type and housing situation to create a stability score affecting creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Both employment stability (captured by job type) and housing situation are important factors in credit assessment. Their interaction may reveal patterns that individual features don't capture, such as how different job types combined with housing arrangements affect credit risk.

2025-09-21 02:00:51,352 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle skewness and normalize distribution for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount has high variance (Std=2756.32) and is right-skewed (Mean=3166.39 > Median=2264.0). Applying log transformation will reduce skewness and make the distribution more normal, which often improves model performance for linear-based algorithms.

2. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings account status to capture combined financial liquidity impact on credit approval>
   Reasoning: Both checking_status and savings_status are important categorical features representing financial stability. Their interaction might reveal patterns that individual features don't capture, such as how different combinations of checking/savings status affect credit approval decisions.

3. <job_housing_stability_score><cross><job><housing><Interaction between job type and housing situation to create stability score affecting creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Job stability and housing situation are both important indicators of financial reliability. The interaction between these categorical features could reveal meaningful patterns about an applicant's overall stability that might not be apparent when considering each feature separately.
