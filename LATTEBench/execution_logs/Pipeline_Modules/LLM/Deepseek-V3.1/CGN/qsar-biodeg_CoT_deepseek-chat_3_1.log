3. <C_percent_times_nO_squared><multiply><C%><nO_squared><Interaction between carbon percentage and squared oxygen count for complex molecular composition effects>

Reasoning:
1. Squaring the already standardized SdO_zscore will emphasize extreme values and capture quadratic relationships that might be important for biodegradability classification, as oxygen content and distribution are critical factors.
2. Multiplying nO (oxygen count) with Me_zscore (standardized electronegativity) creates an interaction term that could reveal how the combination of oxygen presence and electronegativity affects biodegradation potential.
3. The interaction between carbon percentage and squared oxygen count (C% × nO_squared) may capture complex molecular composition effects where both carbon content and oxygen presence (with non-linear effects) jointly influence biodegradability.

Reasoning:
1. Squaring SdO_zscore captures quadratic relationships that might be missed by linear models, potentially revealing threshold effects in oxygen E-state contributions to biodegradability.
2. Multiplying Me (electronegativity) with nHDon (H-bond donors) creates an interaction term that could model how electronic properties affect hydrogen bonding capability, which is crucial for enzymatic degradation.
3. Applying z-score normalization to SpMax_A (molecular connectivity index) makes it more compatible with regularization techniques and helps models that are sensitive to feature scales like SVM or neural networks.

These operations focus on creating non-linear transformations and meaningful interactions between molecular properties that likely influence biodegradability through different mechanisms (electronic, structural, and hydrogen bonding).

2025-09-01 21:27:04,957 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 3374, 'completion_tokens': 465, 'total_tokens': 3839}
2025-09-01 21:27:04,957 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_cube><cube><nO><Cube of nO to capture higher-order non-linear effects of oxygen count on biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The squared nO feature already exists, suggesting non-linear relationships. A cube term can capture more complex patterns that might be missed by quadratic terms alone, especially since oxygen content is critical for biodegradability.

2. <Me_times_nHDon><multiply><Me><nHDon><Interaction between mean electronegativity and H-bond donors to capture electronic effects on hydrogen bonding capability>
   Reasoning: Electronegativity influences hydrogen bond strength, and H-bond donors are directly involved in biodegradation interactions. Their product may reveal synergistic effects important for classification.

3. <SpMax_A_zscore><zscore><SpMax_A><Standardized Lovasz-Pelikan index to normalize its distribution for better model performance>
   Reasoning: Standardizing features often improves model convergence and performance. SpMax_A has a relatively small std (0.227) but non-zero mean (2.2148), so z-scoring could help algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

4. <C_percent_div_nO><divide><C%><nO><Ratio of carbon percentage to oxygen count, indicating oxidation state relative to carbon content>
   Reasoning: The balance between carbon and oxygen is crucial for biodegradation. This ratio might be more informative than either feature alone, as it captures molecular reducedness which affects degradation.

5. <SdssC_abs><abs><SdssC><Absolute value of SdssC E-state sum to handle negative values and emphasize magnitude>
   Reasoning: SdssC has negative values (range [-5.256, 3.12]) and median 0.0. Taking absolute value treats negative and positive deviations equally, which might better capture electron state importance.

6. <F03_C_O_gt_0><greater><F03[C-O]><0><Binary indicator for presence of C-O bonds at distance 3, simplifying the frequency count>
   Reasoning: Converting frequency to binary can sometimes improve models by reducing noise. Many values are 0 (Q1=0.0), so this creates a clear presence/absence feature that might be more robust.

   Reasoning: The number of hydrogen bond donors (nHDon) can influence biodegradability through hydrogen bonding interactions. Squaring this feature may help capture non-linear relationships that linear models might miss, potentially improving predictive performance.

2. <Me_times_nO><multiply><Me><nO><Interaction between mean electronegativity and oxygen count for synergistic effects on biodegradability>

3. <SpMax_A_zscore><zscore><SpMax_A><Standardized leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix to normalize its distribution for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The Lovasz-Pelikan index (SpMax_A) shows moderate variability (std = 0.2270) but could benefit from standardization to improve model convergence and performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling like neural networks or SVMs.

3. <SpMax_A_zscore><zscore><SpMax_A><Standardized leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix for better normalization>

Reasoning:
1. Squaring SdO_zscore will capture quadratic relationships that might be important for biodegradability prediction, as oxygen content and distribution are known to be significant factors.
2. Multiplying Me (electronegativity) with nHDon (hydrogen bond donors) creates an interaction term that could represent electronegativity's influence on hydrogen bonding capability, which affects biodegradability.
3. Applying z-score normalization to SpMax_A (Lovasz-Pelikan index) will help normalize this topological descriptor, making it more suitable for linear models and improving convergence for gradient-based algorithms.
