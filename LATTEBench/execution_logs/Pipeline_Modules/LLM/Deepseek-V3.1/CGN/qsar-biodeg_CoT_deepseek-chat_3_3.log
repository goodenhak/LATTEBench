2025-09-01 21:34:18,495 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at this dataset for biodegradability classification, I notice several patterns that could be informative for feature engineering:

1. Many features have highly skewed distributions with many zeros (like nHM, nN-N, nArNO2)
2. There are both continuous molecular descriptors and binary/count features
3. The target is binary classification (ready/not ready biodegradable)

Here are 3 feature engineering steps:

1. <nO_nN_ratio><ratio><nO><nN><Ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms, as oxygen-rich compounds may be more biodegradable while nitrogen-rich compounds might be less biodegradable>
   
2. <nHDon_nO_interaction><multiply><nHDon><nO><Interaction between hydrogen bond donors and oxygen atoms, as both contribute to water solubility which affects biodegradability>
   
3. <C_percent_normalized><zscore><C%><Z-score normalized carbon percentage to better capture deviations from mean carbon content that might affect biodegradability>

Reasoning:
- The oxygen/nitrogen ratio captures the balance between elements that typically promote vs inhibit biodegradation
- Hydrogen bond donors and oxygen atoms both contribute to hydrophilicity, which is crucial for biodegradation
- Normalizing carbon percentage helps the model better understand what constitutes high or low carbon content relative to the dataset

Reasoning:
1. The nO_nN_ratio_log has an extremely wide range (-13.8 to 16.3) with many outliers. Applying a sigmoid function will compress these extreme values into a bounded range (0,1), making the feature more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of outliers while preserving the ordinal relationship.

2. Carbon content (C_percent_normalized) and oxygen presence (SdO) are both chemically relevant to biodegradability. Their interaction term could reveal compounds where high carbon content combined with specific oxygen bonding patterns (captured by E-states) significantly impacts biodegradation potential, which might not be captured by either feature individually.

3. Both SpMax_B(m) and SpMax_L are spectral descriptors from different matrices (Burden vs Laplace) that capture different aspects of molecular structure. Their ratio creates a new feature that represents the relative importance of mass-weighted vs unweighted structural information, potentially providing better discrimination power for the classification task.

Reasoning:
1. The C_percent_SdO_interaction feature has a wide range (-51.63 to 90.08) with high standard deviation (12.92). Applying square root transformation will help normalize the distribution and reduce the impact of extreme values while maintaining the interaction effect between carbon percentage and oxygen E-state sum.

2. The nO_nN_ratio_log feature has an extremely wide range (-13.82 to 16.30) with many negative values. Taking the absolute value will help capture the magnitude of deviation from a balanced oxygen-nitrogen ratio, which might be more predictive of biodegradability than the signed value.

3. Multiplying normalized carbon percentage with SM6_B(m) (spectral moment weighted by mass) creates an interaction term that combines information about carbon content with molecular structural information. This could reveal patterns where certain carbon percentages combined with specific molecular structures have stronger predictive power for biodegradability.
