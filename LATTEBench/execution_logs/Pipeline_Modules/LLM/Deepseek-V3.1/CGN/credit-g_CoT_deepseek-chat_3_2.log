3. <property_wealth_score><groupbythenmean><property_magnitude><credit_amount><Average credit amount by property type, serving as a wealth proxy indicator>

Reasoning:
1. The credit_to_income_ratio combines credit amount with installment commitment (which represents percentage of disposable income) to create a more direct measure of debt burden. This could better predict creditworthiness than either feature alone.

2. The employment_age_interaction captures how employment stability interacts with life stage. For example, unemployed young applicants might be riskier than unemployed older applicants who may have more savings or assets.

3. The property_wealth_score uses groupbythenmean to create a target encoding-like feature that captures the average credit amount by property type. This serves as a wealth proxy since different property types (real estate vs car vs no property) indicate different financial stability levels, and the average credit amount requested by each group reflects their financial capacity.

3. <age_credit_interaction><multiply><age><credit_amount><Product of age and credit amount, capturing risk profile based on life stage and loan size>

Reasoning:
1. The credit_to_income_ratio provides a more direct measure of debt burden than credit_to_duration_ratio alone, as installment_commitment represents the percentage of disposable income dedicated to loan payments. This helps assess affordability risk.

2. Employment duration and residence stability are both indicators of personal stability. Their interaction may reveal patterns where long employment but short residence (or vice versa) could indicate different risk profiles than consistent stability in both dimensions.

3. Age and credit amount multiplied together can capture non-linear relationships where both high credit amounts for young applicants and moderate amounts for older applicants might represent higher risk scenarios, helping the model learn age-credit amount interactions.
