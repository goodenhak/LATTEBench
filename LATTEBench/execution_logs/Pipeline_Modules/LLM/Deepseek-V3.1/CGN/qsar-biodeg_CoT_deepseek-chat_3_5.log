3. <SdO_to_nO_ratio><ratio><SdO><nO><Ratio of sum of dO E-states to number of oxygen atoms, indicating oxygen electronic environment quality.>

Reasoning:
1. The sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (nO + nN) creates a feature representing total potential hydrogen bond acceptors, which is important for biodegradability as these groups facilitate microbial enzymatic interactions.
2. Squaring the carbon percentage (C%²) captures potential quadratic relationships - both very low and very high carbon content might affect biodegradability differently in a non-linear manner.
3. The ratio of SdO (sum of dO E-states) to nO (number of oxygen atoms) normalizes the electronic state information by oxygen count, providing a measure of average oxygen electronic environment quality which could influence reactivity and biodegradation pathways.

These features leverage domain knowledge about molecular properties affecting biodegradability while introducing non-linear transformations and normalized ratios that often improve model performance with molecular descriptor data.

3. <SpMax_A_SpMax_Bm_diff><diff><SpMax_A><SpMax_B(m)><Difference between leading eigenvalues from adjacency and mass-weighted Burden matrices, indicating structural-electronic disparity.>

Reasoning:
1. nO_plus_nN_sqrt: The sum nO_plus_nN has a range [0,14] and mean 2.52, indicating right-skewed distribution. Applying square root transformation reduces skewness and makes the relationship with biodegradability more linear, improving model performance for algorithms like logistic regression or tree-based models.
2. Me_SdO_ratio_ratio: Me (electronegativity) and SdO_to_nO_ratio (oxygen electronic environment) both relate to electronic properties. Their ratio may capture synergistic or antagonistic effects on biodegradation pathways, as electronic environment influences chemical reactivity.
3. SpMax_A_SpMax_Bm_diff: SpMax_A (structural eigenvalue) and SpMax_B(m) (mass-weighted electronic eigenvalue) represent different molecular aspects. Their difference highlights molecules where structural and electronic properties are misaligned, potentially indicating unusual biodegradation behavior.

3. \<SpMax_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<SpMax_B(m)\>\<SpMax_A\>\<Ratio of SpMax_B(m) to SpMax_A to capture relative spectral graph information\>

Reasoning:
1. nO_sqrt: The number of oxygen atoms (nO) has a range [0,12] with mean=1.83 and std=1.74, indicating right skewness. Applying square root helps normalize the distribution and reduce the impact of extreme values, which often improves model performance for tree-based and linear models.
2. Me_sigmoid: Mean atomic electronegativity (Me) has a narrow range [0.957,1.311]. Applying sigmoid transformation bounds the values to (0,1), which can help neural networks and other models that benefit from normalized inputs, while preserving the relative ordering.
3. SpMax_ratio: Both SpMax_B(m) and SpMax_A are graph-based descriptors from different matrices (Burden vs adjacency). Their ratio creates a new feature that captures the relationship between these two structural representations, potentially providing additional discriminative power for biodegradability classification.

Reasoning:  
1. Standardizing SpMax_B(m) (which has high variance: std=0.97) helps neural networks and distance-based models converge faster.
2. nO is count data with right skew (mean=1.83, Q3=3.0, max=12); sqrt transformation normalizes distribution while preserving zero values.
3. Me has limited range (0.957-1.311) but squaring could reveal non-linear threshold effects in electronegativity impact on biodegradability.

2025-09-20 15:38:34,210 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<nO_sqrt\>\<sqrt\>\<nO\>\<Square root of nO to handle non-linear effects of oxygen count\>
   Reasoning: The number of oxygen atoms (nO) is a key feature in biodegradability prediction as oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl) are often sites for microbial attack. Applying a square root transformation can help normalize its distribution (skewed towards zero) and capture diminishing returns effects where each additional oxygen atom might have less impact.

2. \<SpMax_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<SpMax_B(m)\>\<SpMax_A\>\<Ratio of Burden matrix eigenvalue to adjacency matrix eigenvalue indicating molecular complexity\>
   Reasoning: Both SpMax_B(m) and SpMax_A are graph-based descriptors related to molecular size and connectivity. Their ratio could reveal structural patterns (e.g., how mass-weighted connectivity compares to basic connectivity) that might be more predictive than either feature alone for biodegradability classification.

3. \<C_nO_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<C_percent_squared\>\<nO\>\<Interaction between carbon content squared and oxygen count to capture synergistic effects\>
   Reasoning: Biodegradability often depends on both carbon backbone size (captured by C_percent_squared) and presence of functional groups (nO). Multiplying these features creates an interaction term that might better represent compounds where high carbon content combined with oxygen functionality affects degradation rates.
