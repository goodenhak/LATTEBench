3. \<CreditScore_Employed_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<CreditScore\>\<Employed\>\<Interaction between credit score and employment status, amplifying signal for employed applicants with good credit\>

Reasoning:
1. YearsEmployed/Age ratio: Creates a normalized measure of work experience relative to age. Younger applicants with high ratios may show early career success, while older applicants with low ratios might indicate instability.
2. Debt/Income ratio: This is a fundamental financial metric used by lenders. Even with scaled features, the ratio provides meaningful information about an applicant's ability to handle additional debt.
3. CreditScore × Employed: This interaction term helps identify applicants who are both employed AND have good credit scores - a particularly strong positive signal for credit card approval. The multiplication ensures this feature has high values only when both conditions are met.

3. \<Employed_CreditScore_weighted\>\<multiply\>\<Employed\>\<CreditScore\>\<Alternative employment-credit interaction that directly weights credit score by employment status\>

Reasoning:
1. The YearsEmployed_Age_ratio shows high positive skew (mean 0.0634, Q3 0.0975, max 0.505), so sqrt transformation will help normalize the distribution while preserving the ordinal relationship, making it more useful for linear models.

2. Debt_Income_ratio has extreme outliers (range [0, 15.5M], mean 1.84M, Q3 2.34M) that likely dominate models. Log transformation will compress this range dramatically while maintaining the relative ordering of values, creating a more meaningful financial health metric.

3. While CreditScore_Employed_interaction exists, creating a simple multiplicative interaction (Employed * CreditScore) provides a cleaner, more interpretable feature that directly captures the combined effect of employment status and creditworthiness without potential preprocessing artifacts from the existing interaction feature.

3. <Industry_Income_mean><groupbythenmean><Industry><Income><Mean income by industry sector, capturing economic sector earning potential>

Reasoning:
1. Income_log: The Income feature has extreme skew (mean=1061, Q3=300, max=100000) with a massive standard deviation. Taking the log will normalize this distribution, making the feature more useful for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. Debt_Income_ratio_clipped: The current Debt_Income_ratio has astronomical range (0 to 15.5M) with extreme outliers (Q3=2.3M but mean=1.8M). Binning/capping this feature will prevent these extreme values from dominating the model and create more meaningful categories for credit assessment.

3. Industry_Income_mean: Different industries have different income potentials. Creating mean income by industry captures this economic reality and provides contextual information about an applicant's earning capacity relative to their industry peers, which is valuable for credit assessment.

3. <Age_binned><bin><Age><5><Age grouped into 5 bins to capture non-linear relationships with approval probability>

Reasoning:
1. The Income feature has an extremely high range (0 to 100,000) with mean 1061 and std 6046, indicating severe right skew. Taking the log will normalize this distribution and make it more suitable for linear models while reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. Creating an interaction between Employed and PriorDefault could reveal important patterns - applicants who are both employed and have no prior defaults might have significantly higher approval rates than what either feature alone would suggest.

3. Age likely has a non-linear relationship with credit card approval probability. Younger applicants may be riskier due to limited credit history, middle-aged applicants might be most stable, and older applicants could face different risk factors. Binning into 5 groups will help capture these patterns.

3. <CreditScore_ZipCode_groupmean><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><CreditScore><Mean credit score by zip code area, capturing regional credit behavior patterns>

Reasoning:
1. The Age_Employed_interaction creates a feature that specifically highlights older applicants who are employed, which could be a strong positive signal for creditworthiness that isn't captured by either feature alone.

2. The Debt_Income_ratio has extreme outliers (range up to 15.5 million) with a highly skewed distribution. Applying a log transformation will normalize this distribution and make the feature more useful for linear models while still preserving the relative ordering of values.

3. Grouping by ZipCode and calculating mean CreditScore creates a feature that captures geographic patterns in credit behavior. People in areas with generally higher credit scores might be more likely to get approved, and this feature can help the model learn these regional patterns.
