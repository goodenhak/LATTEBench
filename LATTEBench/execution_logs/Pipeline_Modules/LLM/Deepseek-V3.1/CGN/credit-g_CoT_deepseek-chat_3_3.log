3. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Log-transformed credit amount to handle skewness and extreme values.>

Reasoning:
1. Credit history is a crucial categorical feature for credit risk assessment. Encoding it to numerical values will allow linear models to capture its relationship with the target variable more effectively. The categories have inherent ordering (e.g., all paid is better than delayed previously) which can be preserved through label encoding.

2. Employment duration is another important categorical feature that likely has a monotonic relationship with creditworthiness. Encoding it numerically will help models capture this relationship, where longer employment typically indicates more stability and lower risk.

3. Credit amount is highly skewed (mean=3170, std=2769) with a wide range [276, 18424]. Applying a log transformation will normalize the distribution, reduce the influence of extreme values, and potentially improve model performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling and distribution.
