2. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment stability and loan duration>
3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status for numerical modeling>

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount_per_dependent: This creates a normalized measure of credit burden relative to family size. People with more dependents might have higher living expenses, so the same credit amount represents a different relative burden. This could help distinguish between applicants with similar credit amounts but different family responsibilities.

2. employment_duration_interaction: Combining employment stability with loan duration could reveal important patterns. For example, someone with unstable employment (<1 year) taking a long-term loan (60 months) might be higher risk than someone with stable employment (>=7 years) taking the same loan. The cross operator creates all possible combinations of these categorical features.

3. savings_status_encoded: While we already have checking_status_encoded, savings status is another crucial financial stability indicator that should be encoded for numerical models. Different savings levels (no savings, <100, 100-500, etc.) likely have different impacts on creditworthiness and converting this to numerical values will make it more usable for algorithms.

3. <employment_duration_ratio><ratio><employment><duration><Ratio of employment years to loan duration, indicating job stability relative to loan term>

Reasoning:
1. Credit amount divided by existing credits creates a feature that shows the average credit size per existing loan, which could indicate risk concentration at the bank. This might be more predictive than using credit_amount alone.

2. Creating an interaction between checking and savings statuses captures potential synergistic effects between these two financial stability indicators. A person with both poor checking and savings status might be much higher risk than either alone.

3. The ratio of employment years to loan duration provides insight into job stability relative to the loan term. Someone employed longer than the loan duration might be lower risk, while those with shorter employment than loan duration could be higher risk.
