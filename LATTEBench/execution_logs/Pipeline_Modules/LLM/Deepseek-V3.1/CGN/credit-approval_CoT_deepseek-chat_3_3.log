3. \<AgeGroup\>\<bin\>\<Age\>\<Age_binned_into_groups_to_capture_non-linear_relationships_with_credit_approval\>

Reasoning:
1. Debt-to-Income Ratio: This is a fundamental metric used by lenders to assess an applicant's ability to manage monthly payments. A high ratio indicates a higher risk of default. Creating this feature explicitly allows the model to learn this important financial relationship directly.
2. Employed x CreditScore Interaction: The impact of a credit score on approval likelihood is likely different for employed versus unemployed individuals. A cross (interaction) feature can help the model capture this conditional relationship, as employment status significantly affects creditworthiness.
3. Age Binning: The relationship between age and credit approval is often non-linear. Younger applicants might be riskier due to shorter credit history, while very old applicants might be on fixed incomes. Binning age into groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-40, 41-65, 65+) helps the model learn these segment-specific patterns more effectively than using raw, linear age.

3. <DebtIncomeRatio_reciprocal><reciprocal><DebtIncomeRatio><Reciprocal_of_debt_income_ratio_to_handle_extreme_values_and_create_more_normal_distribution>

Reasoning:
1. AgeSquared: Age often has nonlinear relationships with credit risk (very young and very old applicants may have different risk profiles). Squaring age helps capture these potential U-shaped or inverted U-shaped patterns that a linear feature might miss.

2. EmployedCreditScoreCross_encoded: The EmployedCreditScoreCross is a categorical interaction feature that combines employment status and credit score. Label encoding converts it to numerical values that can be used by models that require numerical input, preserving the informational value of this engineered interaction.

3. DebtIncomeRatio_reciprocal: The original DebtIncomeRatio has extreme skew (range 0-19M) with a mean of 1.76M. Taking the reciprocal helps handle these extreme values, reduces the impact of outliers, and may create a more normally distributed feature that's easier for models to work with, while still preserving the inverse relationship between debt burden and creditworthiness.

   Reasoning: DebtIncomeRatio has an enormous range (0 to 19M) with extreme right skew. Log transformation will compress the scale and make the distribution more normal, which helps linear models and improves gradient-based learning.

2. <YearsEmployed_Industry_encoded><groupbythenmean><Industry><YearsEmployed><Mean_years_employed_by_industry_capturing_industry-specific_employment_stability>
   Reasoning: Different industries have different employment stability patterns. This feature captures the typical years employed in each industry, which may be predictive of creditworthiness beyond individual employment duration.

3. <PriorDefault_BankCustomer_cross><cross><PriorDefault><BankCustomer><Interaction_between_prior_default_status_and_bank_customer_status>
   Reasoning: The combination of having a prior default AND being a bank customer (or not) could be highly predictive. A bank customer with prior default might be treated differently than a non-customer with prior default.

2025-09-01 21:48:30,345 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtIncomeRatio_log><log><DebtIncomeRatio><Log_transform_of_DebtIncomeRatio_to_handle_extreme_skew_and_outliers>
Reasoning: DebtIncomeRatio has an extremely wide range (0 to 19M) with high mean and std, indicating severe right skew. Log transformation can normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. <YearsEmployed_Industry_mean><groupbythenmean><Industry><YearsEmployed><Mean_years_employed_by_industry,_capturing_industry-specific_employment_stability>
Reasoning: Different industries may have different employment patterns and stability. Grouping by Industry and calculating mean YearsEmployed creates a feature that captures industry norms for employment duration, which could be predictive of creditworthiness.

3. <PriorDefault_BankCustomer_cross><cross><PriorDefault><BankCustomer><Interaction_between_prior_default_status_and_bank_customer_status>
Reasoning: The combination of having a prior default and being a bank customer (or not) may have non-linear effects on credit card approval. A customer with prior default but active bank relationship might be treated differently than one without banking history.

3. <YearsEmployed_EmployedCreditScoreCross_encoded_cross><cross><YearsEmployed><EmployedCreditScoreCross_encoded><Interaction_between_YearsEmployed_and_EmployedCreditScoreCross_encoded_to_capture_joint_effects>

Reasoning:
1. DebtIncomeRatio_log: The DebtIncomeRatio has an extremely high range (0 to 19M) and is heavily right-skewed (mean=1.76M, median=0.18). A log transform will compress the scale and make the distribution more normal, which is beneficial for linear models and helps with outlier sensitivity.
2. Industry_encoded: Industry is a categorical feature with 14 categories. Label encoding converts it to numerical values (0-13) which can be used by models that can handle ordinal relationships, or it can be one-hot encoded later if needed. This captures industry-specific risk patterns.
3. YearsEmployed_EmployedCreditScoreCross_encoded_cross: This creates an interaction between years employed and the encoded employment-credit score cross feature. Since both relate to employment stability and creditworthiness, their interaction may reveal non-linear patterns (e.g., long employment with poor credit vs short employment with good credit) that improve predictive power.

   Reasoning: DebtIncomeRatio has an extremely wide range (up to 19M) with high mean and std, indicating severe right skew. Log transformation will normalize the distribution and make it more suitable for linear models.

2. <Industry_encoded><label_encode><Industry><Label_encoding_Industry_to_convert_categorical_to_numeric_for_modeling>
   Reasoning: Industry is a categorical feature that needs to be converted to numerical format for most ML algorithms. Label encoding preserves the ordinal relationship if any exists between categories.

3. <EmployedCreditScoreCross_encoded_sqrt><sqrt><EmployedCreditScoreCross_encoded><Square_root_transform_to_normalize_the_distribution_of_encoded_interaction_feature>
   Reasoning: EmployedCreditScoreCross_encoded has a highly skewed distribution (median=0, Q3=9.75, mean=3.89) with many zeros. Square root transformation will help normalize the distribution while preserving zeros.

2025-09-01 21:49:29,879 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtIncomeRatio_log><log><DebtIncomeRatio><Log_transform_of_DebtIncomeRatio_to_handle_extreme_skew_and_reduce_outlier_impact>
   Reasoning: DebtIncomeRatio has an extremely wide range (up to 19M) with high mean and std, indicating severe right skew. Log transformation will compress the scale and make the distribution more normal, which should help linear models and tree-based models handle this feature better.

2. <YearsEmployed_binned><bin><YearsEmployed><Binned_YearsEmployed_to_capture_nonlinear_relationships_with_employment_duration>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a highly skewed distribution (median=1.0, mean=2.23, Q3=2.625) with many low values. Binning will help capture nonlinear effects where short employment might be risky, moderate employment beneficial, and very long employment potentially indicating older applicants with different risk profiles.

3. <Industry_encoded><label_encode><Industry><Label_encoded_Industry_categories_to_convert_to_numeric_for_modeling>
   Reasoning: Industry is currently categorical with 14 categories. Label encoding will convert these to numerical values that can be used by models while preserving some ordinal information about industry risk profiles that might exist in the data.
