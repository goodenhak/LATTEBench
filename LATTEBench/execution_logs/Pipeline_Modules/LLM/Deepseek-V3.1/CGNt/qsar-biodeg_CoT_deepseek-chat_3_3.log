2025-09-02 16:26:52,107 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN_squared><square><nO_plus_nN><Squared sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms to capture potential quadratic relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The nO_plus_nN feature is already valuable (appears in top features), and squaring it could capture nonlinear relationships where the effect of oxygen/nitrogen atoms on biodegradability increases or decreases at different rates.

2. <C_percent_cube><cube><C%><Cubed carbon percentage to capture more complex nonlinear relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: Since C_percent_squared is already a top feature, cubing the original C% could capture even more complex cubic relationships between carbon content and biodegradability that might exist in the data.

3. <SpMax_L_SM6_L_product><multiply><SpMax_L><SM6_L><Product of leading eigenvalue and spectral moment from Laplace matrix, capturing combined structural information>
   Reasoning: The ratio of these features is already valuable. Creating a product could capture complementary information about molecular structure complexity that might be predictive of biodegradability.

2025-09-02 16:27:12,595 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN_squared><square><nO_plus_nN><Squared sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms to capture potential quadratic relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (nO_plus_nN) is already a useful feature. Squaring it may reveal nonlinear relationships where higher concentrations of these atoms have disproportionate effects on biodegradability, potentially capturing threshold effects or saturation points.

2. <SpMax_L_SM6_L_product><multiply><SpMax_L><SM6_L><Product of leading eigenvalue and spectral moment from Laplace matrix, capturing joint structural information>
   Reasoning: While the ratio of these features is already beneficial, their product might capture complementary structural information about molecular complexity. The interaction between these two spectral graph theory descriptors could reveal additional patterns not captured by the ratio alone.

3. <C_percent_nO_ratio><ratio><C%><nO><Ratio of carbon percentage to oxygen count, indicating oxidation state relative to carbon content>
   Reasoning: This ratio could be significant since biodegradation often involves oxidation processes. Molecules with high carbon content but low oxygen might be less biodegradable, while those with balanced ratios might be more susceptible to microbial breakdown. This captures the chemical energy potential and oxidation state.

2025-09-02 16:27:32,150 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN_squared><square><nO_plus_nN><Squared sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms to capture potential quadratic relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The existing nO_plus_nN feature shows good predictive power. Squaring this value could help capture nonlinear relationships where the effect of oxygen and nitrogen atoms on biodegradability increases or decreases at a non-constant rate.

2. <C_percent_cube><cube><C%><Cubed carbon percentage to capture more complex nonlinear relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: Since C_percent_squared is already a top feature, applying a cube transformation could help model even more complex polynomial relationships between carbon percentage and biodegradability, potentially capturing inflection points in the relationship.

3. <SpMax_L_SM6_L_product><multiply><SpMax_L><SM6_L><Product of Laplace matrix eigenvalues and spectral moments, capturing structural complexity interactions>
   Reasoning: Instead of just the ratio (which is already a top feature), the product of these two Laplace matrix descriptors might capture different aspects of molecular structural complexity that could be predictive of biodegradability through multiplicative interactions.

2025-09-02 16:27:53,256 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nHDon_plus_nX><plus><nHDon><nX><Sum of hydrogen bond donors and halogen atoms, which may indicate competing effects on biodegradability>
   Reasoning: Halogen atoms (nX) can make compounds more resistant to biodegradation, while hydrogen bond donors (nHDon) might promote it. Their sum could capture a balance or interaction between these opposing factors, potentially revealing compounds where one effect dominates.

2. <C_percent_times_nO><multiply><C%><nO><Product of carbon percentage and oxygen count, highlighting oxygen-rich organic compounds>
   Reasoning: High carbon percentage indicates organic character, and oxygen atoms are often involved in biodegradation pathways. Multiplying these may identify compounds that are both organic and oxygen-rich, which could be more biodegradable (e.g., carbohydrates).

3. <SpMax_A_to_SpMax_L_ratio><ratio><SpMax_A><SpMax_L><Ratio of leading eigenvalues from adjacency and Laplace matrices, indicating graph connectivity differences>
   Reasoning: SpMax_A (Lovasz-Pelikan) and SpMax_L (Laplace) both capture graph properties but emphasize different aspects. Their ratio might reveal subtle structural patterns (e.g., branching vs. cyclicity) that affect biodegradability.

2025-09-02 16:28:16,070 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and current top features, I can see that interactions between molecular descriptors and structural properties are important for biodegradability classification. The top features already include oxygen/nitrogen sum, carbon percentage squared, and Laplace matrix ratio, suggesting that combining structural and compositional features is effective.

Here are 3 potential next steps:

1. Interaction between hydrogen bonding potential and carbon content: The number of donor atoms (nHDon) indicates hydrogen bonding capability, while carbon percentage (C%) relates to molecular composition. Their interaction could reveal how hydrogen bonding influences biodegradability differently across carbon content levels.

2. Squared oxygen count to capture nonlinear effects: Similar to how C% squared was beneficial, oxygen count (nO) might have nonlinear relationships with biodegradability since oxygen-containing functional groups are often key sites for microbial attack.

3. Ratio of halogen atoms to heavy atoms: Halogen atoms (nX) often decrease biodegradability, while heavy atoms (nHM) represent molecular size. Their ratio could indicate the relative halogen content, which might be more predictive than absolute counts.

   <nO_plus_nN_times_C_percent><multiply><nO_plus_nN><C%><Interaction between oxygen+nitrogen atoms and carbon percentage>
   

2. Logarithmic transformation of heavy atom count: nHM (number of heavy atoms) has a skewed distribution with many zeros. A log transformation could help normalize this distribution and potentially reveal non-linear relationships with biodegradability.
   
   <log_nHM><log><nHM><Logarithm of heavy atom count to handle skewed distribution>
   

3. Ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms: While we have the sum of O+N, the ratio between them might provide additional information about the chemical's properties and potential biodegradation pathways.
   
   <O_to_N_ratio><ratio><nO><nN><Ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms, indicating different chemical properties>
   

These features target different aspects: interaction effects between existing strong predictors, normalization of skewed distributions, and exploring new ratio relationships that might capture additional chemical insights relevant to biodegradability.

2025-09-02 16:28:59,747 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN_squared><square><nO_plus_nN><Squared sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms to capture potential quadratic relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (nO_plus_nN) is already a useful feature. Squaring it may reveal nonlinear relationships where both very low and very high values have different impacts on biodegradability than moderate values.

2. <C_percent_cubed><cube><C%><Cubed carbon percentage to capture more complex nonlinear relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: Since C_percent_squared (C% squared) is already a top feature, cubing the carbon percentage may capture even more complex nonlinear patterns in how carbon content affects biodegradability.

3. <SpMax_L_SM6_L_product><multiply><SpMax_L><SM6_L><Product of leading eigenvalue and spectral moment from Laplace matrix, capturing combined structural information>
   Reasoning: The ratio of these features (SpMax_L_to_SM6_L_ratio) is already useful. Calculating their product may provide complementary information about the overall scale of these structural descriptors.

2025-09-02 16:29:21,681 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN_squared><square><nO_plus_nN><Squared sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms to capture potential quadratic relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (nO_plus_nN) is already a useful feature. Squaring it could capture nonlinear relationships where the effect of hydrogen bonding potential on biodegradability increases at an accelerating rate.

2. <SpMax_L_SM6_L_product><multiply><SpMax_L><SM6_L><Product of Laplace matrix eigenvalues and spectral moments to capture structural complexity interactions>
   Reasoning: Both SpMax_L and SM6_L are structural descriptors from the Laplace matrix. Their product might capture synergistic effects in molecular complexity that the ratio alone doesn't capture, potentially improving biodegradability prediction.

3. <C_percent_nO_ratio><ratio><C%><nO><Ratio of carbon percentage to oxygen count, capturing oxidation state and molecular composition balance>
   Reasoning: The balance between carbon content and oxygen atoms could be significant for biodegradability, as highly carbon-rich molecules with few oxygen atoms might be less biodegradable, while oxygen-rich molecules might be more susceptible to microbial degradation.

2025-09-02 16:29:45,872 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and current top features, I can see that the most valuable features so far involve combinations of oxygen/nitrogen atoms, carbon percentage squared, and structural complexity ratios. Here are 3 potential next steps to generate new features:

1. Interaction between hydrogen bonding potential and carbon content: The sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (nO_plus_nN) is already a strong feature. Combining this with carbon percentage could capture how biodegradability relates to both hydrogen bonding potential and carbon chain length.

   <nO_plus_nN_C_interaction><multiply><nO_plus_nN><C%><Interaction between hydrogen bonding potential and carbon content>

2. Logarithmic transformation of carbon percentage: Since carbon percentage has a wide range and squared version is already useful, a log transformation might capture different aspects of the nonlinear relationship with biodegradability.

   <log_C_percent><log><C%><Logarithm of carbon percentage to capture diminishing returns effect>

3. Ratio of halogen atoms to heavy atoms: The presence of halogens (nX) often makes compounds less biodegradable, and normalizing by heavy atoms (nHM) could provide a measure of halogen density relative to molecular size.

   <halogen_density><ratio><nX><nHM><Ratio of halogen atoms to heavy atoms indicating halogen concentration>

These features target different chemical properties that influence biodegradability: molecular composition interactions, nonlinear carbon effects, and inhibitory halogen presence.
