2025-09-02 14:56:04,947 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_per_dependent><divide><credit_amount><num_dependents><Credit amount per dependent, indicating financial burden relative to family size.>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio feature that normalizes the credit amount by the number of dependents. A higher value might indicate greater financial strain per family member, which could be predictive of credit risk. This captures an aspect of affordability not directly represented in existing features.

2. <checking_status_savings_status_concat><concat><checking_status><savings_status><Concatenation of checking and savings status for enhanced categorical interaction.>
   Reasoning: While we have an interaction feature, a simple concatenation might capture different patterns or be more amenable to certain models. This creates a new categorical feature with combined states that might reveal subtle creditworthiness signals when used with encoding techniques like target encoding.

3. <duration_age_ratio><ratio><duration><age><Ratio of loan duration to age, indicating the relative commitment length compared to life stage.>
   Reasoning: This ratio captures whether the loan term is long relative to the applicant's age. Older applicants with longer durations might have different risk profiles than younger ones. It introduces a life-stage context to the duration feature.

2025-09-02 14:56:23,801 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_duration_product><multiply><credit_amount><duration><Product of credit amount and duration, capturing total financial exposure.>
Reasoning: Multiplying credit_amount by duration gives the total monetary value of the loan obligation, which may better capture risk than ratio alone. This could help identify cases where either very large amounts or very long durations (or both) present higher risk.

2. <checking_savings_ratio><ratio><checking_status><savings_status><Ratio of checking to savings status after label encoding, indicating financial balance.>
Reasoning: First converting both categorical features to numerical via label encoding, then calculating their ratio. This could reveal imbalances between checking and savings that might indicate financial stress (e.g., high checking but low savings suggesting recent financial changes).

3. <credit_history_duration_interaction><cross><credit_history><duration><Interaction between credit history and loan duration, capturing risk profile over time.>
Reasoning: Combining credit history (which indicates past repayment behavior) with duration (which indicates future commitment period). Longer durations with poor credit history might be particularly risky, while shorter durations with good history might be very safe.

2025-09-02 14:56:42,204 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_duration_product><multiply><credit_amount><duration><Product of credit amount and duration, capturing total financial commitment.>
   Reasoning: Multiplying credit amount by duration gives the total financial obligation over the loan term, which may better indicate risk than the ratio alone. This could capture non-linear effects where both high amount and long duration together increase default risk.

2. <checking_savings_ratio><ratio><checking_status><savings_status><Ratio of checking to savings status after label encoding, indicating financial balance.>
   Reasoning: First convert both categorical features to numerical via label encoding, then compute their ratio. This quantifies the relationship between checking and savings stability (e.g., high checking relative to low savings might indicate imbalance), which could be predictive.

3. <credit_history_purpose_cross><cross><credit_history><purpose><Interaction between credit history and loan purpose, capturing risk by purpose given history.>
   Reasoning: Certain purposes (e.g., business) might be riskier for borrowers with poor credit history, while others (e.g., education) might be safer. This cross feature captures these combined effects beyond individual factors.

Reasoning: This creates a ratio feature that normalizes the credit amount by the number of dependents. A large credit per dependent might indicate higher financial stress, which could be predictive of credit risk.

2. <checking_savings_ratio><ratio><checking_status><savings_status><Ratio of checking to savings status after label encoding, capturing relative financial strength.>
Reasoning: First convert both categorical features to numerical using label encoding, then compute their ratio. This captures the relationship between checking and savings in a continuous way, potentially revealing patterns not captured by the interaction cross.

3. <duration_age_ratio><ratio><duration><age><Ratio of loan duration to age, indicating the relative commitment length compared to life stage.>
Reasoning: This ratio might reveal different risk patterns - younger people with longer duration loans might be riskier than older people with shorter loans, or vice versa. It captures the interaction between these two important numerical features.

2025-09-02 14:57:18,907 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_per_dependents><ratio><credit_amount><num_dependents><Credit amount per dependent, measuring financial burden relative to family size.>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio feature that normalizes credit amount by the number of dependents, capturing the relative financial burden which could be more predictive than absolute credit amount for credit approval decisions.

2. <duration_age_ratio><ratio><duration><age><Loan duration relative to age, capturing if loan term is appropriate for life stage.>
   Reasoning: This ratio feature combines duration and age to assess whether the loan term length is appropriate given the applicant's life stage, which may influence repayment capacity and credit risk.

3. <checking_savings_purpose_interaction><cross><checking_savings_interaction><purpose><Three-way interaction between checking/savings status and loan purpose for enhanced risk assessment.>
   Reasoning: This creates a higher-order interaction feature that combines the already powerful checking_savings_interaction with loan purpose, potentially capturing more nuanced risk patterns based on both financial stability and intended use of funds.

2025-09-02 14:57:39,229 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_per_dependent><divide><credit_amount><num_dependents><Credit amount per dependent, indicating financial burden relative to family size.>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio feature that normalizes credit amount by number of dependents. A high credit amount per dependent suggests greater financial strain, which could negatively impact credit approval. This captures family financial responsibility better than credit_amount alone.

2. <checking_savings_ratio><ratio><checking_status><savings_status><Ratio of checking to savings status after label encoding, indicating balance between liquid and saved assets.>
   Reasoning: First convert categorical checking_status and savings_status to numerical via label encoding, then compute their ratio. This quantifies the relationship between immediate liquidity (checking) and longer-term savings, which could be a strong indicator of financial stability beyond their individual values.

3. <credit_history_duration_interaction><cross><credit_history><duration><Interaction between credit history and loan duration, capturing risk profile over time.>
   Reasoning: Combining credit history (risk indicator) with duration (time exposure) creates features that capture how risk profiles change with loan term. For example, critical/other existing credit with long duration might be much riskier than the same history with short duration.

2025-09-02 14:57:57,890 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_history_duration_interaction><cross><credit_history><duration><Interaction between credit history and loan duration, as longer loans may be riskier for those with poor credit history.>
   Reasoning: Credit history is a strong predictor of creditworthiness, and its interaction with loan duration could reveal patterns where longer loan terms are riskier for applicants with problematic credit histories.

2. <credit_amount_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><age><Ratio of credit amount to age (as proxy for income/experience), indicating affordability relative to life stage.>
   Reasoning: Age often correlates with income and financial stability. This ratio could capture whether the credit amount is appropriate for the applicant's life stage, which is a key factor in credit decisions.

3. <savings_status_existing_credits><cross><savings_status><existing_credits><Interaction between savings status and number of existing credits, indicating financial capacity to handle additional debt.>
   Reasoning: Savings status reflects financial reserves, while existing credits show current debt burden. Their interaction could reveal applicants who have adequate savings to support additional credit despite existing obligations.

2025-09-02 14:58:16,886 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_per_dependents><ratio><credit_amount><num_dependents><Credit amount per dependent, indicating financial burden relative to family size.>
   Reasoning: This creates a ratio feature that normalizes the credit amount by the number of dependents. A high credit amount per dependent might indicate higher financial strain, which could negatively impact credit approval. This captures the relative burden better than using credit_amount alone.

2. <duration_age_ratio><ratio><duration><age><Ratio of loan duration to age, capturing if loan term is appropriate for age.>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants might be expected to have shorter loan terms due to higher income growth potential, while older applicants might have longer terms. This ratio helps capture age-appropriate loan duration patterns that could affect credit risk assessment.

3. <checking_status_savings_status_cross><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Enhanced interaction between checking and savings status beyond the existing interaction feature.>
   Reasoning: While there's already a checking_savings_interaction feature, creating a fresh cross feature might capture different combinations or patterns that the original feature engineering might have missed, potentially revealing additional subtle financial stability indicators.

2025-09-02 14:58:34,190 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_per_dependent><divide><credit_amount><num_dependents><Credit amount per dependent, indicating financial burden relative to family size.>
   Reasoning: This creates a normalized financial obligation metric that accounts for family responsibilities, which could be more predictive than raw credit amount since individuals with more dependents may have higher expenses and different repayment capacity.

2. <duration_age_ratio><ratio><duration><age><Ratio of loan duration to age, capturing life stage appropriateness of loan term.>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants might appropriately handle longer durations for investments like education, while older applicants might need shorter terms. This interaction could reveal patterns not captured by age or duration alone.

3. <checking_savings_purpose_interaction><cross><checking_savings_interaction><purpose><Combined effect of financial stability and loan purpose on credit risk.>
   Reasoning: The riskiness of a loan purpose (e.g., business vs. car) may interact differently with financial stability. This high-dimensional interaction could capture nuanced risk patterns that individual features miss.
