2025-09-21 15:28:35,879 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_to_duration_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Ratio of credit amount to loan duration, indicating the monthly burden if repaid linearly.>
   Reasoning: This ratio captures the monthly repayment amount if the loan were repaid in equal installments over the duration. A higher ratio indicates a heavier monthly burden, which might increase default risk.

2. <age_group><bin><age><Binned age into groups (e.g., young, middle-aged, senior) to capture non-linear relationships with credit risk.>
   Reasoning: Age often has a non-linear relationship with creditworthiness. Younger applicants might be less stable, while very old applicants might have retirement income issues. Binning helps capture these patterns.

3. <checking_status_encoded><label_encode><checking_status><Encoded checking status to numerical values, potentially revealing an ordinal relationship with credit risk.>
   Reasoning: The checking_status categories appear to have an inherent order (no checking < <0 < 0<=X<200 < >=200). Label encoding preserves this ordinal information which might be predictive.

   Reasoning: This feature combines credit amount with installment commitment to create a measure of payment burden per installment, which could be more predictive than either feature alone by capturing the actual financial obligation per payment period.

2. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment status and loan duration, capturing how employment stability affects longer-term loans.>
   Reasoning: Employment stability (employment) and loan duration are both important risk factors. Their interaction may reveal that longer loans to less stable employment situations are higher risk, or that stable employment mitigates risk for longer durations.

3. <savings_to_credit_ratio><ratio><savings_status><credit_amount><Ratio of savings status (encoded) to credit amount, measuring the relative size of savings compared to the loan request.>
   Reasoning: First converting savings_status to numerical via label encoding, then creating a ratio with credit_amount. This captures whether the loan amount is large relative to the person's savings, which could indicate higher risk if the savings are insufficient to cover potential defaults.

   Reasoning: This creates an interaction feature that combines the monthly burden (credit_amount_to_duration_ratio) with the installment commitment percentage. Higher values indicate greater financial strain relative to income, which should be predictive of credit risk.

2. <savings_status><target_encoding><credit_amount><Target encoded savings_status weighted by credit_amount, capturing how savings status affects credit risk differently across loan sizes>
   Reasoning: Target encoding savings_status while weighting by credit_amount creates a feature that captures how the relationship between savings and credit approval varies with loan amount. Larger loans might require stronger savings status for approval.

3. <checking_status_encoded><multiply><credit_amount_per_installment><Interaction between checking status encoded and credit amount per installment, capturing payment capacity relative to account status>
   Reasoning: This combines the ordinal checking status information with the average payment size per installment. Better checking status combined with manageable payment sizes should indicate lower risk, while poor checking status with large payments indicates higher risk.

   Reasoning: The encoded checking status (which likely represents account quality) combined with loan duration could reveal important risk patterns. Longer loans with poor checking status might be much riskier than short-term ones.

2. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status to numerical values, potentially revealing an ordinal relationship with credit risk similar to checking_status_encoded.>
   Reasoning: Since checking_status_encoded proved valuable, applying the same ordinal encoding approach to savings_status could capture similar risk patterns related to financial stability and savings behavior.

3. <credit_amount_to_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio of credit amount to installment commitment percentage, estimating the approximate disposable income level of the applicant.>
   Reasoning: This creates a proxy for income level by combining credit amount with the installment commitment percentage. Higher ratios might indicate lower income applicants who are taking larger relative financial burdens.

   Reasoning: This creates an interaction feature that combines the monthly burden (credit_amount_to_duration_ratio) with the installment commitment percentage. Higher values indicate both high monthly payments and high income commitment, which might be a stronger risk indicator.

2. <savings_status><target_encoding><credit_amount><Mean credit amount by savings status, revealing if certain savings groups tend to request larger loans>
   Reasoning: Target encoding savings_status with credit_amount could reveal patterns where certain savings groups (e.g., those with higher savings) tend to request larger loans, which might be associated with different risk profiles.

3. <checking_status_encoded><multiply><duration><Interaction between encoded checking status and loan duration, capturing how account status affects risk over different loan terms>
   Reasoning: This interaction feature combines the ordinal checking status (where higher values indicate better account status) with loan duration. It might reveal that the protective effect of good checking status diminishes for longer loan terms.

   Reasoning: This creates a more direct measure of debt burden by relating the total credit amount to the installment commitment percentage, which represents the portion of disposable income allocated to loan repayment. This could better capture affordability than the existing credit_amount_per_installment.

2. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings account status, capturing combined financial stability.>
   Reasoning: Combining checking and savings status creates a composite feature that represents overall financial health. Those with both healthy checking and savings accounts are likely better credit risks than those with poor status in both.

3. <purpose_duration_interaction><cross><purpose><duration><Interaction between loan purpose and duration, capturing risk patterns specific to purpose-term combinations.>
   Reasoning: Different loan purposes have different risk profiles at various durations. For example, long-term business loans might be riskier than short-term ones, while the opposite might be true for car loans. This interaction captures these nuanced relationships.

   Reasoning: This creates a feature that combines the monthly repayment burden (credit_amount_to_duration_ratio) with the borrower's ability to pay (installment_commitment). Higher values indicate greater financial strain relative to income.

2. <checking_status_encoded><multiply><duration><Interaction between checking status and loan duration, capturing how financial stability affects risk over different loan terms>
   Reasoning: This interaction feature combines the encoded checking status (which likely indicates financial stability) with loan duration. Longer loans with poor checking status might be riskier than short-term loans with the same status.

3. <savings_status><target_encoding><credit_history><Target encoded savings_status using credit_history as target, capturing how savings patterns relate to credit behavior>
   Reasoning: Target encoding can reveal complex relationships between categorical variables. Here we use credit_history (which directly indicates payment behavior) to encode savings_status, potentially uncovering how savings patterns correlate with credit risk.

   Reasoning: Combining categorical features like checking_status and savings_status through cross product can reveal synergistic effects that individual features might miss. For example, someone with both poor checking and savings status may be much higher risk than either alone.

2. <credit_amount_duration_product><multiply><credit_amount><duration><Product of credit amount and duration, representing total financial exposure over loan lifetime.>
   Reasoning: Multiplying credit_amount by duration creates a feature that captures the total monetary value at risk over the loan period, which may be more predictive than either feature alone for assessing repayment capacity.

3. <purpose_encoded_credit_history><cross><purpose><credit_history><Interaction between loan purpose and credit history, revealing how purpose affects risk assessment based on past behavior.>
   Reasoning: The risk profile of a loan purpose (e.g., business vs. car) may interact differently with credit history. A poor history might be more concerning for riskier purposes, making this cross feature potentially valuable.

2025-09-21 15:30:55,540 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_to_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio of credit amount to installment commitment percentage, indicating the debt burden relative to income.>
   Reasoning: This creates a more direct measure of debt burden by relating the total credit amount to the installment commitment percentage of disposable income. This could be more predictive than the existing credit_amount_per_installment feature.

2. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings account status, capturing combined financial stability.>
   Reasoning: Combining information from both checking and savings accounts may reveal patterns that individual features miss. Those with both poor checking and savings status might be higher risk, while those with strong status in both might be lower risk.

3. <duration_employment_interaction><cross><duration><job><Interaction between loan duration and job type, capturing how employment stability affects longer-term loan risk.>
   Reasoning: Different job types may have different risk profiles for longer duration loans. For example, unskilled workers with long-term loans might be higher risk than skilled workers with similar loan terms.
