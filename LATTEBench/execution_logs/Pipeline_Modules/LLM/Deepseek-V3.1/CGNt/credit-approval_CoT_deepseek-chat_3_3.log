2025-09-02 17:10:14,669 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtToIncomeRatioLog><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Log transform of debt-to-income ratio to handle extreme skewness and reduce impact of outliers>
   Reasoning: The DebtToIncomeRatio has an extremely wide range (0 to 19M) with high mean and std, indicating severe right skew. Log transformation can normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme values on the prediction.

2. <AgeEmployedInteraction><cross><Age><Employed><Interaction between age and employment status, as older employed applicants may have better approval chances>
   Reasoning: Employment status is a strong indicator (mean=0.44), and age may interact with it (older employed applicants likely have more stable careers). Creating an interaction feature can capture this non-linear relationship that might not be modeled by individual features alone.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, as certain industries may have systematically higher credit scores>
   Reasoning: Industry is a categorical feature with 14 categories. Grouping by industry and calculating mean credit scores can capture industry-specific creditworthiness patterns that might be predictive of approval outcomes.

2025-09-02 17:11:09,128 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtToIncomeRatioLog><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Log transform of DebtToIncomeRatio to handle extreme values and reduce skewness>
   Reasoning: The DebtToIncomeRatio has an extremely wide range (0 to 19M) and high standard deviation. A log transform can help normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers while preserving the relative ordering of values.

2. <AgeBin><bin><Age><Binned age groups to capture non-linear relationships between age and credit approval>
   Reasoning: Age likely has a non-linear relationship with creditworthiness (very young and very old applicants may have different approval rates). Binning age into groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-50, 51+) can help the model capture these patterns more effectively than using raw age values.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, as certain industries may have systematically higher/lower credit scores>
   Reasoning: Different industries may have different income stability patterns that affect credit scores. This feature captures the average creditworthiness of applicants from each industry, which could be a strong predictor since people in certain sectors (like Financials) might be more creditworthy than others.

   Reasoning: The DebtToIncomeRatio has an extremely wide range (0 to 19M) with high mean and std. A log transform can help normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. <AgeEmployedInteraction><cross><Age><Employed><Interaction between age and employment status to capture different creditworthiness patterns across age groups>
   Reasoning: Employment status is a strong indicator, but its effect might vary with age. Younger employed individuals might have different risk profiles than older employed individuals. This interaction can help the model capture these nuanced relationships.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, as certain industries may have systematically different credit profiles>
   Reasoning: Different industries may have different income stability and employment patterns. Calculating the mean credit score by industry can provide a contextual feature that helps compare an individual's credit score against their industry peers.

   Reasoning: The DebtToIncomeRatio has an extremely wide range (0 to 19M) with high mean and std. A log transform can help normalize this distribution and make the relationship with the target more linear, which often improves model performance with skewed financial data.

2. <AgeEmployedInteraction><cross><Age><Employed><Interaction between age and employment status, as employment impact on creditworthiness may vary by age>
   Reasoning: Employment status is a crucial factor, but its importance might differ across age groups (e.g., younger applicants might be more penalized for unemployment). Creating an interaction feature can help capture these nuanced relationships that the model might miss with individual features.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, as certain sectors may have systematically different credit profiles>
   Reasoning: Different industries have different income stability and risk profiles. Calculating the average credit score per industry can provide contextual information about an applicant's peer group, which may be predictive of credit card approval likelihood.

2. <AgeEmployedInteraction><cross><Age><Employed><Interaction between age and employment status, as older employed applicants may have different approval patterns>
   Reasoning: Age and employment status are both important factors in credit decisions. Creating an interaction feature can capture non-linear relationships where the effect of age on approval probability differs based on employment status.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, as certain industries may have systematically different credit profiles>
   Reasoning: Industry type may correlate with income stability and credit behavior. Calculating the mean credit score by industry creates a target encoding-like feature that can help the model learn industry-specific patterns in creditworthiness.
