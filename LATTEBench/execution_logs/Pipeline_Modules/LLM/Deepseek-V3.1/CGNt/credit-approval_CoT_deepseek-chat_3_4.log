3. <IncomeYearsEmployedProduct><multiply><Income><YearsEmployed><Product of Income and Years Employed, indicating total career earnings potential>

Reasoning:
1. AgeDebtRatio: Debt burden relative to age could be a strong predictor. Younger people with high debt might be riskier, while older people with low debt might be more stable. This ratio captures this relationship.

2. EmployedCreditScoreCross: Employment status and credit score are both important factors in credit decisions. Their interaction might reveal patterns where employed individuals with good credit are highly desirable, while unemployed with poor credit are high risk.

3. IncomeYearsEmployedProduct: This creates a feature representing approximate total career earnings (income × years employed), which could be a strong indicator of financial stability and repayment capacity. High values suggest established financial history.

   Reasoning: The effect of debt on credit card approval likelihood likely differs based on employment status. This multiplicative interaction captures that differential effect, potentially improving predictive power.

3. <CreditScoreBinned><bin><CreditScore><Binned CreditScore to handle its skewed distribution and non-linear relationships>
   Reasoning: CreditScore has Q1=0, Median=0, Q3=2, Mean=2.3, indicating most values are 0 with a long tail. Binning will create meaningful categories that may have non-linear relationships with the target.

2025-09-21 16:56:35,125 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <CreditScoreLog><log><CreditScore><Log transformed CreditScore to handle its skewed distribution and reduce the influence of extreme values>
   Reasoning: The CreditScore feature has a highly skewed distribution (range [0,67], Q1=0.0, Median=0.0, Q3=2.0, Mean=2.3). Applying a log transformation can help normalize this distribution and make the relationship with the target variable more linear, which often improves model performance for tree-based and linear models.

2. <EmployedCitizenCross><cross><Employed><Citizen><Interaction between employment status and citizenship to capture differential effects of citizenship on credit approval for employed vs unemployed individuals>
   Reasoning: Citizenship status (ByBirth, ByOtherMeans, Temporary) may have different impacts on credit approval depending on employment status. This cross feature can help the model learn these complex interactions that might not be captured by the individual features alone.

3. <ZipCodeGroupMeanCreditScore><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><CreditScore><Mean credit score by zip code area, capturing geographic patterns in creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Zip codes often correlate with socioeconomic factors that influence creditworthiness. Grouping by zip code and calculating the mean credit score creates a feature that captures geographic patterns, which could be predictive of credit card application success rates in different areas.

   Reasoning: The CreditScore feature has a highly skewed distribution (Q1=0, Median=0, Q3=2, Mean=2.3). Applying a sigmoid transformation can help normalize the scale and handle extreme values while maintaining the relative ordering of scores.

2. <YearsEmployedBinned><bin><YearsEmployed><Bin YearsEmployed to capture non-linear relationships with credit card approval>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a right-skewed distribution (Q1=0.165, Median=1.0, Q3=2.56, Mean=2.15) with potential non-linear effects. Binning can help the model capture threshold effects where certain employment duration ranges have different impacts on approval likelihood.

3. <CitizenTargetEncoded><target_encoding><Citizen><Target encode Citizen feature to capture the relationship between citizenship status and approval rate while handling categorical values>
   Reasoning: Citizen is a categorical feature with 3 categories. Target encoding can effectively capture the predictive power of citizenship status by representing each category with the mean approval rate for that group, which may be more informative than one-hot encoding for tree-based models.

2025-09-21 16:57:05,868 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtSquared><square><Debt><Squared Debt to capture non-linear effects of debt on credit card approval>
   Reasoning: Squaring the Debt feature can help capture quadratic relationships that might exist between debt levels and the likelihood of approval. This could reveal that both very low and very high debt levels have different impacts than moderate levels.

2. <EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Interaction between employment status and years employed to capture combined effect on stability>
   Reasoning: The interaction between employment status and years employed could provide valuable information about job stability. Employed individuals with many years of employment likely represent lower risk than those recently employed or unemployed.

3. <ZipCodeGroupApproval><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Target><Mean approval rate by ZipCode to capture geographic patterns in credit card approvals>
   Reasoning: Zip codes often correlate with socioeconomic factors that influence creditworthiness. Creating a target-encoded feature by ZipCode can capture geographic patterns in approval rates that might not be apparent from the raw ZipCode values alone.

2025-09-21 16:57:23,389 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <YearsEmployedLog><log><YearsEmployed><Log transform YearsEmployed to handle skewness and extreme values>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a range of [0.0, 28.5] with Q1=0.165, Median=1.0, Q3=2.56, indicating significant right skew. Log transformation can normalize this distribution and potentially reveal non-linear relationships with credit card approval that aren't captured by the raw feature.

2. <EmployedCreditScoreCrossTargetEncoded><target_encoding><EmployedCreditScoreCross><Target encoding of employment-credit score interaction to capture approval probability patterns>
   Reasoning: EmployedCreditScoreCross is a categorical feature with many categories (20+). Target encoding can effectively capture the relationship between each employment-credit score combination and the approval rate, potentially revealing subtle patterns that one-hot encoding might miss due to sparsity.

3. <DebtAgeRatio><divide><Debt><AgeDebtRatioLog><Ratio of debt to log-transformed age-debt ratio to capture debt burden relative to age-adjusted capacity>
   Reasoning: This creates a feature that represents current debt level relative to the age-adjusted debt capacity (captured by AgeDebtRatioLog). This could be a powerful predictor as it combines both current debt situation and age-normalized debt handling capacity into a single metric.

2025-09-21 16:57:42,972 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtSquared><square><Debt><Squared Debt to capture non-linear effects of debt on credit card approval>
   Reasoning: Squaring the Debt feature can help capture quadratic relationships that might be present. Since debt is a continuous numerical variable, applying a square transformation may reveal patterns that linear models or tree-based models can leverage, especially if the effect of debt on approval is not linear.

2. <EmployedCreditScoreCross><target_encoding><EmployedCreditScoreCross><Target encoding for EmployedCreditScoreCross to capture the approval rate for each employment-credit score combination>
   Reasoning: The EmployedCreditScoreCross is a categorical feature with many categories (e.g., 0_0, 1_1, 1_3, etc.). Target encoding can effectively summarize the relationship between each category and the target variable (approval), providing a numerical value that represents the likelihood of approval for each combination. This can be more informative than one-hot encoding for high-cardinality features.

3. <YearsEmployedBinned><bin><YearsEmployed><Binned YearsEmployed to handle non-linearities and outliers in years of employment>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a wide range (0 to 28.5) and a skewed distribution (mean=2.15, median=1.0). Binning can help group similar values together and reduce the impact of outliers, making it easier for the model to learn patterns. For example, it might be that having 0-1 years of employment has a similar effect, which binning can capture.

   Reasoning: DebtSquared shows extreme values (up to 784) with high std (96.35). The reciprocal transformation will help handle these extreme values and capture the non-linear relationship where very high debt levels might have a disproportionately negative impact on approval chances.

2. <YearsEmployedBinned><bin><YearsEmployed><Binned YearsEmployed to capture non-linear effects of employment duration on creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a highly skewed distribution (Q1=0.165, Q3=2.56, max=28.5) with many low values. Binning will help capture the non-linear relationship where the first few years of employment might be much more significant than additional years beyond a certain threshold.

3. <CitizenPriorDefaultCross><cross><Citizen><PriorDefault><Interaction between citizenship status and prior default history to capture differential effects>
   Reasoning: Citizenship status (categorical) and prior default history (binary) are both important predictors. Their interaction could reveal that the impact of prior defaults varies by citizenship status (e.g., prior defaults might be more detrimental for temporary citizens than for natural-born citizens).

2025-09-21 16:58:17,679 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <PriorDefaultSigmoid><sigmoid><PriorDefault><Sigmoid transformation of PriorDefault to smooth the binary feature and potentially capture non-linear effects>
   Reasoning: Applying a sigmoid transformation to the binary PriorDefault feature can introduce a smooth transition between the two states (0 and 1), which might help the model capture more nuanced patterns rather than a hard threshold. This can be particularly useful if the relationship between prior defaults and credit card approval is not purely linear.

2. <YearsEmployedDebtRatio><ratio><YearsEmployed><Debt><Ratio of YearsEmployed to Debt, indicating ability to manage debt relative to employment stability>
   Reasoning: Creating a ratio of years employed to debt can provide a measure of debt burden relative to job stability. A higher ratio suggests more employment experience per unit of debt, which might be a positive indicator for creditworthiness. This feature could capture an interaction effect that isn't fully captured by the existing features.

3. <CitizenPriorDefaultCross><cross><Citizen><PriorDefault><Interaction between citizenship status and prior default history, as the impact of default may vary across citizenship categories>
   Reasoning: The impact of prior defaults on credit card approval might differ based on citizenship status (e.g., temporary residents might be more severely penalized for defaults). Creating a cross feature between these categorical and binary variables can help capture these potential interaction effects that the model might not learn from the individual features alone.
