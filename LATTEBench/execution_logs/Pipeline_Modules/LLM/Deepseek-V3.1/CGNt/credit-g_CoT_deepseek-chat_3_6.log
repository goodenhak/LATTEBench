2025-09-21 15:35:56,654 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_to_duration_ratio_by_age_group><groupbythenmean><age_group><credit_to_duration_ratio><Mean credit-to-duration ratio grouped by age group, capturing how repayment burden varies across different life stages>
   Reasoning: Age groups likely have different income levels and financial responsibilities. Grouping the credit-to-duration ratio by age group can reveal patterns where certain age brackets consistently handle higher or lower repayment burdens, which could be predictive of creditworthiness.

2. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings status, capturing combined financial stability indicators>
   Reasoning: Checking and savings accounts represent different aspects of financial health. Their interaction might reveal synergistic effects - for example, someone with both good checking and savings status might be much lower risk than what either feature alone would suggest.

3. <employment_duration_ratio><ratio><duration><employment><Ratio of loan duration to employment duration, indicating job stability relative to commitment period>
   Reasoning: This creates a feature that compares the stability of employment (longer employment = more stable) with the loan duration. A high ratio (long loan duration relative to short employment) might indicate higher risk, while a low ratio suggests stable income throughout the loan period.

   Reasoning: Savings status indicates financial stability. Grouping the credit-to-duration ratio by savings status can reveal patterns where individuals with different savings levels handle debt burdens differently, which is highly relevant for credit risk assessment.

2. <checking_savings_stability><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings status capturing combined financial stability indicators>
   Reasoning: Both checking and savings accounts reflect an individual's financial health. Creating a cross feature captures synergistic effects between these two financial indicators, potentially revealing risk patterns that aren't apparent when considering each feature separately.

3. <duration_by_purpose><groupbythenmean><purpose><duration><Average loan duration by purpose, revealing typical repayment periods for different credit purposes>
   Reasoning: Different loan purposes (car, education, business) typically have different repayment timelines. Grouping duration by purpose can help identify if certain purposes are associated with unusually long or short repayment periods, which might indicate higher risk.

   Reasoning: The credit_to_duration_ratio has high variance (Std=174.7). Applying z-score normalization will help identify extreme values that might indicate high-risk applicants with unusually high monthly repayment burdens relative to the population.

2. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment stability and loan duration to capture risk of long-term unemployment during loan period>
   Reasoning: Employment stability (employment) and loan duration (duration) are both important risk factors. Their interaction could reveal higher risk for long-duration loans given to those with unstable employment (e.g., unemployed or <1 year employment).

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status to numerical values representing financial stability hierarchy>
   Reasoning: Savings status is categorical with inherent ordering (e.g., no known savings < <100 < 100<=X<500 < 500<=X<1000 < >=1000). Label encoding preserves this ordinal relationship which might be more informative than one-hot encoding for tree-based models.

   Reasoning: The credit_to_duration_ratio has a high standard deviation (174.72), indicating significant variability. Applying z-score normalization will help identify extreme values that might be strong predictors of credit risk, making it easier for the model to learn patterns related to unusually high or low repayment burdens.

2. <checking_savings_stability_score><groupbythenmean><checking_savings_interaction><credit_to_duration_ratio><Mean credit-to-duration ratio by checking/savings combination, capturing financial stability patterns>
   Reasoning: The checking_savings_interaction feature combines two important financial stability indicators. Calculating the average credit burden (credit_to_duration_ratio) for each combination can reveal which specific financial profile combinations are associated with higher risk, adding a targeted stability metric.

3. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment status and loan duration to capture risk patterns based on job stability and commitment length>
   Reasoning: Employment status is a key risk factor, and loan duration affects repayment risk. Creating interaction terms between these categorical and numerical features can reveal patterns like whether unemployed applicants with long-term loans represent particularly high risk, adding nuanced risk segmentation.

   Reasoning: The credit_to_duration_ratio has a high standard deviation (174.72) relative to its mean (172.73), indicating potential outliers. Applying z-score normalization will scale this feature to have zero mean and unit variance, making it more suitable for linear models and helping with gradient-based optimization.

2. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status to numerical values to capture its ordinal relationship with credit risk.>
   Reasoning: Savings status likely has an inherent ordinal relationship (e.g., no known savings < <100 < 100<=X<500 < 500<=X<1000 < >=1000) that could be valuable for prediction. Label encoding preserves this ordering better than one-hot encoding and creates a more compact representation.

3. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment status and loan duration, capturing how employment stability affects risk for different loan terms.>
   Reasoning: The risk associated with loan duration might differ based on employment stability. For example, longer loan terms might be riskier for unemployed individuals but safer for those with stable employment. This interaction captures these combined effects.

   Reasoning: The credit_to_duration_ratio has high variance (Std=174.7) and extreme values (range=24-2482). Applying z-score normalization will help identify unusually high or low repayment burdens that might be strong predictors of default risk, making this feature more comparable across different loan amounts and durations.

2. <checking_savings_stability_score><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Combined financial stability score from checking and savings account status interaction>
   Reasoning: While checking_savings_interaction exists, it creates many sparse categories. A cross operation between these two fundamental financial stability indicators could create a more meaningful combined feature that captures the interaction effect while being more manageable for models than the high-cardinality interaction feature.

3. <employment_duration_interaction><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment stability and loan duration to assess risk>
   Reasoning: Longer employment typically indicates stability, while longer loan durations increase risk. The interaction between these factors could reveal patterns where stable employment mitigates the risk of longer loans, or unstable employment combined with long durations creates high-risk scenarios that aren't captured by either feature alone.

2025-09-21 15:37:39,806 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_to_duration_ratio_by_savings_status><groupbythenmean><savings_status><credit_to_duration_ratio><Mean credit-to-duration ratio grouped by savings status, capturing how repayment burden varies with savings level>
   Reasoning: Savings status indicates financial stability. Grouping the credit-to-duration ratio by savings status can reveal patterns where individuals with different savings levels handle debt burdens differently, which is highly relevant for credit risk assessment.

2. <checking_savings_stability_index><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Combined categorical indicator of financial stability from checking and savings accounts>
   Reasoning: While checking_savings_interaction exists, a direct cross of the original checking_status and savings_status features might create a more granular and interpretable combined financial stability feature that could capture non-linear interactions missed by the existing interaction feature.

3. <duration_to_age_ratio><ratio><duration><age><Ratio of loan duration to applicant's age, indicating the relative term length compared to life stage>
   Reasoning: This feature contextualizes the loan duration relative to the applicant's age. A long-term loan might be riskier for an older applicant nearing retirement, while it might be more manageable for a younger applicant with more earning years ahead. This captures an important temporal risk aspect.

   Reasoning: The credit_to_duration_ratio has a high standard deviation (174.72) and wide range, indicating potential outliers. Z-score standardization will help the model better handle extreme values and identify unusually high or low repayment burdens.

2. <checking_savings_interaction_encoded><label_encode><checking_savings_interaction><Numerical encoding of checking-savings interaction for better model interpretation>
   Reasoning: The checking_savings_interaction is a categorical feature with many categories (20). Label encoding will convert it to numerical values that can be more effectively used by linear models while preserving the ordinal relationships that might exist in the financial stability hierarchy.

3. <duration_age_employment_interaction><cross><duration_to_age_ratio><employment><Interaction between age-duration ratio and employment status, capturing life stage financial capacity>
   Reasoning: Combining the duration_to_age_ratio (which indicates life stage relative to loan term) with employment status could reveal patterns about how employment stability interacts with life stage when making credit decisions. This might capture scenarios like young employed applicants vs older unemployed applicants.

2025-09-21 15:38:15,234 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_to_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><income><Ratio of credit amount to income, measuring debt burden relative to earnings>
   Reasoning: While income isn't explicitly listed, it's a fundamental factor in credit decisions. This ratio would capture the applicant's ability to repay the loan relative to their earnings capacity, which is a crucial determinant of creditworthiness.

2. <employment_residence_interaction><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment stability and residence stability, capturing overall life stability>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Combining them could reveal patterns where long-term stability in both areas indicates lower risk, while instability in either could signal higher risk of default.

3. <credit_history_purpose_interaction><cross><credit_history><purpose><Interaction between credit history and loan purpose, capturing risk patterns by loan type>
   Reasoning: Different loan purposes may have different risk profiles even with the same credit history. For example, someone with delayed payments might be riskier for business loans but acceptable for essential purchases like domestic appliances. This interaction could capture these nuanced patterns.

Note: These suggestions assume that 'income' is available as a feature (though not explicitly listed), as it's fundamental to credit assessment. If income is not available, alternative features like credit_amount_to_savings_ratio could be considered.
