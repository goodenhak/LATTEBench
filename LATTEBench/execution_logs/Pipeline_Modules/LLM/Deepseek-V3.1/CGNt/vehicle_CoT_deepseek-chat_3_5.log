   Reasoning: The scaled radius of gyration has a wide range (109-268) and applying a square root transformation can help normalize the distribution, making it more Gaussian. This often improves model performance with algorithms sensitive to feature distributions. Different vehicle types likely have different mass distribution characteristics.

2. <SKEWNESS_MINOR_MAJOR_DIFF><subtract><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><Difference between skewness about minor and major axes to capture asymmetry patterns that may be distinctive for different vehicle types, particularly between symmetric cars and asymmetric buses/vans.>
   Reasoning: Skewness measures asymmetry in the silhouette. The difference between minor and major axis skewness could reveal distinctive patterns - compact cars (OPEL/SAAB) might have more symmetric profiles while elongated vehicles (BUS/VAN) might show more pronounced asymmetry differences between axes.

3. <ELONGATEDNESS_PR_AXIS_RATIO><ratio><ELONGATEDNESS><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><Ratio of elongation to principal axis aspect ratio to capture the relationship between overall elongation and the specific aspect ratio of the primary axis, which may help differentiate between vehicles with similar elongation but different width-to-length proportions.>
   Reasoning: Both elongation and principal axis aspect ratio describe shape characteristics, but their ratio might reveal more nuanced differences. For example, a bus and van might have similar elongation but different width-to-length ratios, which this feature could capture effectively.

   Reasoning: The scaled radius of gyration measures how mass is distributed around the center. Squaring this feature amplifies differences in mass distribution patterns that might be characteristic of different vehicle types (e.g., buses vs cars).

2. <ELONGATEDNESS_MAXLENGTH_RECT_CROSS><cross><ELONGATEDNESS><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY><Cross feature between ELONGATEDNESS and MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY to capture interaction between overall elongation and rectangularity along the maximum length dimension, potentially improving discrimination between similarly elongated but differently proportioned vehicles.>
   Reasoning: While we already have an elongation-rectangularity cross feature, using MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY instead of PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY might capture different aspects of vehicle shape, particularly for vehicles that are elongated but have different width-to-length proportions.

3. <SCALED_VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF><diff><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><Absolute difference between scaled variances along major and minor axes to quantify shape anisotropy magnitude, which may better separate elongated vehicles from compact ones than the ratio alone.>
   Reasoning: The ratio of variances captures anisotropy direction, but the absolute difference might better quantify the degree of anisotropy. This could help distinguish strongly elongated vehicles (buses, vans) from more symmetrical ones (cars) by measuring how much more variance exists along one axis versus the other.

2025-09-21 17:28:26,535 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SCALED_VAR_MINOR_MAJOR_RATIO_INV><ratio><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS><Inverse ratio of scaled variances to capture complementary shape anisotropy information, potentially better distinguishing vehicles with different variance distributions.>
   Reasoning: The existing SCALED_VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_RATIO captures the ratio of major to minor axis variance. Creating the inverse ratio (minor/major) provides complementary information that might better separate vehicles where the minor axis variance dominates, potentially improving classification of more symmetric vehicle types.

2. <ELONGATEDNESS_SQUARED><square><ELONGATEDNESS><Squared ELONGATEDNESS to amplify differences in vehicle elongation characteristics, particularly useful for distinguishing between highly elongated vehicles (BUS) and moderately elongated ones (VAN).>
   Reasoning: ELONGATEDNESS has a moderate range (26-61) and squared values will emphasize the extremes. This non-linear transformation could help better separate vehicle classes where elongation is a key distinguishing factor, particularly between buses (most elongated) and vans.

3. <KURTOSIS_MINOR_MAJOR_DIFF><subtract><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><Difference between kurtosis measures to capture asymmetry in the distribution of shape characteristics along different axes, which may vary by vehicle type.>
   Reasoning: Kurtosis measures the tailedness of distributions. The difference between minor and major axis kurtosis could reveal subtle shape characteristics that distinguish vehicle types, particularly between more uniformly shaped vehicles (OPEL/SAAB) and those with more irregular silhouettes.

   Reasoning: While the ratio captures the proportion between variances, the absolute difference might better capture the magnitude of anisotropy. Large differences could indicate highly elongated shapes (BUS/VAN), while small differences might indicate more symmetric shapes (OPEL/SAAB).

2. <ELONGATEDNESS_SQUARED><square><ELONGATEDNESS><Squared ELONGATEDNESS to amplify the effect of highly elongated vehicles and capture non-linear relationships that might better separate buses and vans from cars.>
   Reasoning: ELONGATEDNESS already shows good separation potential (range 26-61). Squaring this feature will emphasize higher values, potentially creating better separation between highly elongated vehicles (BUS/VAN) and less elongated ones (OPEL/SAAB).

3. <PR_AXIS_RECTANGULARITY_BINNED><bin><PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY><Binned PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY to capture non-linear relationships and create categorical groupings that might correlate better with vehicle types, especially for distinguishing between vehicles with similar rectangularity values.>
   Reasoning: PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY has a relatively narrow range (17-29) but shows interesting distribution. Binning this feature might reveal non-linear patterns and create more distinct categories that correlate with vehicle types, potentially capturing subtle rectangularity differences between vehicle classes.

Reasoning:
1. SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION_SQUARED: The radius of gyration relates to how mass is distributed around the center. Squaring this value amplifies differences in rotational inertia characteristics, which could help distinguish between compact cars (OPEL/SAAB) with more centralized mass distribution versus larger vehicles (BUS/VAN) with more distributed mass.

2. ELONGATEDNESS_PR_AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO_CROSS: This cross feature combines two fundamental shape characteristics - overall elongation and the aspect ratio of the principal axis. Vehicles like buses and vans typically have different combinations of these properties compared to compact cars, and their interaction might reveal subtle distinctions that individual features miss.

3. SCATTER_RATIO_KURTOSIS_MINOR_CROSS: The scatter ratio describes inertia distribution while kurtosis about the minor axis indicates tail heaviness of the shape distribution. Their interaction could capture complex shape properties that differentiate vehicles with similar overall dimensions but different silhouette characteristics, particularly useful for distinguishing between the four vehicle classes.

   Reasoning: The difference between variances along major and minor axes could provide additional information about shape anisotropy beyond just the ratio. Vehicles like buses and vans (more elongated) would have larger differences compared to compact cars.

2. <ELONGATEDNESS_SQUARE_ROOT><sqrt><ELONGATEDNESS><Square root of ELONGATEDNESS to normalize the distribution and potentially improve linear separability for models sensitive to feature scaling.>
   Reasoning: ELONGATEDNESS has a range of [26,61] with mean 40.78 and std 7.74. Applying square root could help normalize the distribution and make the feature more Gaussian-like, which often benefits linear models and distance-based algorithms.

3. <KURTOSIS_MINOR_MAJOR_CROSS><cross><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><Cross feature between kurtosis measures to capture interaction between tail behavior along different axes, which may reveal subtle shape differences between vehicle types.>
   Reasoning: Kurtosis measures the tailedness of distributions and the interaction between kurtosis along different axes could capture complex shape characteristics that single features might miss, potentially helping to distinguish between similar vehicle silhouettes.

Reasoning:
1. The SCALED_VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_RATIO is already a useful feature, but applying a log transformation can help normalize its distribution and handle any potential skewness, making it more suitable for linear models and potentially revealing additional patterns.

2. ELONGATEDNESS shows significant variation across vehicle types (range 26-61), and squaring this feature can amplify the differences between highly elongated vehicles (buses/vans) and less elongated ones (cars), potentially improving classification accuracy.

3. SCATTER_RATIO (inertia distribution) and ELONGATEDNESS both capture important shape characteristics but from different perspectives. Their interaction might reveal subtle distinctions between vehicle types that aren't captured by either feature alone, particularly for vehicles with similar elongation but different mass distribution patterns.

   Reasoning: The reciprocal transformation creates a non-linear version of the variance ratio that may better separate vehicles at both ends of the anisotropy spectrum. This could help distinguish very elongated vehicles (like buses) from very compact ones.

2. <ELONGATEDNESS_SQUARED><square><ELONGATEDNESS><Squared ELONGATEDNESS to amplify differences in vehicle elongation characteristics, which is crucial for distinguishing between compact cars and elongated vehicles like buses and vans.>
   Reasoning: Elongatedness is a key differentiator between vehicle types. Squaring this feature will emphasize extreme values, potentially making it easier to separate highly elongated vehicles (buses/vans) from more compact ones (cars).

3. <SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION_NORM><zscore><SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION><Z-score normalized radius of gyration to standardize this shape distribution measure, making it more comparable across different vehicle types and potentially revealing outliers.>
   Reasoning: The scaled radius of gyration measures how mass is distributed around the center. Normalizing it with z-score will help identify vehicles with unusually high or low mass distribution characteristics, which could correspond to specific vehicle types.

   Reasoning: The SCALED_VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_RATIO has a range of [0.28, 0.79] with mean 0.47 and std 0.10. Taking the log of this ratio can help normalize the distribution and potentially reveal non-linear relationships that might be more informative for classification.

2. <ELONGATEDNESS_SQUARED><square><ELONGATEDNESS><Squared ELONGATEDNESS to capture quadratic relationships and emphasize extreme values, which may better distinguish between highly elongated vehicles (BUS/VAN) and less elongated ones (OPEL/SAAB).>
   Reasoning: ELONGATEDNESS ranges from [26, 61] with mean 40.8 and std 7.7. Squaring this feature can amplify the differences between vehicles with high elongation (likely buses and vans) and those with lower elongation (cars), potentially improving class separation.

3. <SCATTER_ELONGATEDNESS_CROSS><cross><SCATTER_RATIO><ELONGATEDNESS><Cross feature between SCATTER_RATIO and ELONGATEDNESS to capture interaction between inertia properties and elongation, which may provide unique signatures for different vehicle types.>
   Reasoning: SCATTER_RATIO (inertia ratio) and ELONGATEDNESS both describe shape properties but from different perspectives. Their interaction might reveal complex shape characteristics that are distinctive for specific vehicle types, particularly for distinguishing between similarly shaped vehicles.
