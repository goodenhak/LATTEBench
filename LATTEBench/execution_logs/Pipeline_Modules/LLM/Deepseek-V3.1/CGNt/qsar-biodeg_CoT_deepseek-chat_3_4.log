   Reasoning: Both oxygen and nitrogen atoms are involved in hydrogen bonding, which can influence biodegradation. Summing them creates a feature that captures the total potential for hydrogen bond donation/acceptance, potentially improving predictive power.

2. <C_percent_squared><square><C%><Squared percentage of carbon atoms to capture nonlinear relationships with biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The percentage of carbon atoms (C%) might have a nonlinear relationship with biodegradability, as both very low and very high carbon content could affect degradation. Squaring this feature helps model such quadratic effects.

3. <nX_binned><bin><nX><Binned number of halogen atoms to capture categorical effects on biodegradability>
   Reasoning: Halogen atoms (nX) are often associated with reduced biodegradability due to their electronegativity. Binning this feature (e.g., 0, 1-2, 3+) can help model threshold effects where even small amounts of halogens significantly impact degradation.

   Reasoning: The nHM_nO_ratio feature has an extremely wide range (up to 10,000,000) with high variance. Applying a logarithmic transformation will help normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme outliers while preserving the relative ordering of values.

2. <SdO_F03_C_O_interaction><multiply><SdO><F03[C-O]><Interaction between sum of dO E-states and frequency of C-O bonds at distance 3>
   Reasoning: Both SdO (sum of dO E-states) and F03[C-O] (frequency of C-O bonds) are related to oxygen-containing functional groups. Their interaction might capture synergistic effects in biodegradability, as compounds with both high oxygen content and specific structural arrangements of C-O bonds could have different degradation characteristics.

3. <C_percent_Me_weighted><multiply><C%><Me><Interaction between carbon percentage and mean electronegativity>
   Reasoning: Carbon percentage (C%) and mean electronegativity (Me) both relate to the electronic properties of molecules. Their interaction could help identify compounds where high carbon content combines with specific electronegativity patterns that might affect biodegradability through electronic effects on chemical reactivity.

   Reasoning: The nHM_nO_ratio has an extremely wide range (up to 10^7) and high variance. Applying z-score normalization will scale this feature to have zero mean and unit variance, making it more suitable for models sensitive to feature scale while preserving the relative distance information that might be predictive.

2. <SdO_nO_interaction><multiply><SdO><nO><Interaction between sum of dO E-states and number of oxygen atoms>
   Reasoning: Both SdO (sum of dO E-states) and nO (number of oxygen atoms) are related to oxygen content in molecules. Their interaction term could capture synergistic effects where the combination of oxygen count and specific electronic states provides more predictive power than either feature alone for biodegradability classification.

3. <Me_Mi_electronegativity_diff><diff><Me><Mi><Difference between mean electronegativity and mean ionization potential>
   Reasoning: Both Me (mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity) and Mi (mean first ionization potential) are electronic descriptors scaled on carbon. Their difference might capture electronic polarization effects that influence molecular reactivity and biodegradation pathways, potentially improving classification performance.

The target is binary classification of biodegradability, and molecular structure features seem crucial.

Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps:

1. Interaction between nitrogen content and oxygen content: Nitrogen and oxygen atoms often play key roles in biodegradation processes through functional groups. Their interaction could capture synergistic effects.
   - <nN_nO_interaction><multiply><nN><nO><Interaction between number of nitrogen and oxygen atoms>

2. Difference in electronegativity descriptors: The difference between mean ionization potential and mean electronegativity could indicate electron distribution patterns that affect biodegradability.
   - <Mi_Me_diff><diff><Mi><Me><Difference between mean ionization potential and mean electronegativity>

3. Ratio of C-O frequency to oxygen count: This could measure how oxygen atoms are distributed in the molecular structure, which might influence degradation pathways.

2025-09-21 16:28:28,580 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and current top features, I can see that interactions between atomic composition features and topological descriptors are proving valuable. The top features include ratios, differences, and multiplicative interactions. Here are 3 potential next steps:

1. <nO_nN_ratio><ratio><nO><nN><Ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms>
   - Reasoning: The current top features include nHM_nO_ratio, but oxygen and nitrogen atoms have different effects on biodegradability. Their ratio could capture the balance between these electronegative atoms, which might influence molecular stability and biodegradation potential.

2. <SdO_Me_interaction><multiply><SdO><Me><Interaction between sum of dO E-states and mean electronegativity>
   - Reasoning: SdO (sum of dO E-states) captures oxygen-related electronic properties, while Me (mean electronegativity) describes overall electron distribution. Their interaction could reveal how oxygen electronic effects are modulated by the molecular electronegativity environment.

3. <F03_C_O_F03_C_N_diff><diff><F03[C-O]><F03[C-N]><Difference between C-O and C-N frequencies at distance 3>
   - Reasoning: Both C-O and C-N bonds at topological distance 3 are important structural features. Their difference could indicate whether oxygen-rich or nitrogen-rich bonding patterns dominate in the molecular structure, which relates to biodegradability.

These features build on the success of ratio and difference operations in the current top features, while focusing on specific atomic interactions that are chemically meaningful for biodegradability prediction.

2025-09-21 16:28:45,959 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nHM_nO_ratio_log><log><nHM_nO_ratio><Log transformation of nHM_nO_ratio to handle extreme values>
   Reasoning: The nHM_nO_ratio feature has an extremely high range and standard deviation due to outliers (when nO=0). Taking the log transform can help normalize this distribution and make the feature more useful for modeling, especially since many models are sensitive to variables with heavy-tailed distributions.

2. <SdO_nO_ratio><ratio><SdO><nO><Ratio of SdO to number of oxygen atoms>
   Reasoning: SdO (Sum of dO E-states) measures oxygen-related electronic properties, while nO is the count of oxygen atoms. Creating a ratio normalizes the electronic effect by the number of oxygen atoms present, which could provide a more meaningful measure of oxygen's electronic influence per atom rather than in total.

3. <Me_Mi_interaction><multiply><Me><Mi><Interaction between mean electronegativity and mean ionization potential>
   Reasoning: Both Me (mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity) and Mi (mean first ionization potential) are fundamental electronic properties that influence molecular reactivity. Their interaction term could capture synergistic electronic effects that might be important for biodegradability prediction, as both properties affect how molecules interact with biological systems.

2025-09-21 16:29:03,967 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nHM_nO_ratio_log><log><nHM_nO_ratio><Log transformation of nHM_nO_ratio to handle extreme values>
   Reasoning: The nHM_nO_ratio feature has an extremely high range [0.0, 10000000.0] with a massive standard deviation. Taking the log will compress this range and make the distribution more normal, which should help machine learning models handle this feature better without being dominated by extreme outliers.

2. <SdO_nO_ratio><ratio><SdO><nO><Ratio of Sum of dO E-states to number of oxygen atoms>
   Reasoning: SdO (Sum of dO E-states) represents electronic state contributions from oxygen atoms, while nO is the count of oxygen atoms. Creating a ratio normalizes the electronic state sum by the number of oxygen atoms, which could reveal the average electronic contribution per oxygen atom - potentially more informative than either feature alone for biodegradability classification.

3. <Me_Mi_interaction><multiply><Me><Mi><Interaction between mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity and mean first ionization potential>
   Reasoning: Both Me (mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity) and Mi (mean first ionization potential) are electronic properties scaled on Carbon atom. Their interaction term could capture synergistic electronic effects that influence chemical reactivity and biodegradability, as both properties relate to electron distribution and bonding characteristics.

   Reasoning: The SdO feature (sum of dO E-states) represents oxygen-related electronic properties, while nO is the count of oxygen atoms. Creating a ratio could normalize the electronic effect per oxygen atom, potentially revealing oxygen's electronic contribution more precisely. This might help distinguish between different types of oxygen-containing functional groups.

2. <Me_Mi_interaction><multiply><Me><Mi><Interaction between mean electronegativity and mean ionization potential>
   Reasoning: Me (mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity) and Mi (mean first ionization potential) both describe electronic properties of molecules. Their interaction could capture synergistic electronic effects that influence biodegradability, as both electronegativity and ionization potential affect how molecules interact with biological systems.

3. <F03_C_O_nO_ratio_log><log><F03_C_O_nO_ratio><Logarithm of C-O frequency to oxygen ratio>
   Reasoning: The F03_C_O_nO_ratio has a wide range (0-6) with many zeros. Applying a log transformation (with appropriate handling of zeros) could help normalize the distribution and make the feature more suitable for linear models, while still capturing the relative importance of C-O bonds at distance 3.
