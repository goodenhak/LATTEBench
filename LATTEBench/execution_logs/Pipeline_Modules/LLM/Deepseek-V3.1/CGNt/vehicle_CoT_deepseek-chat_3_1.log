Reasoning:
1. GYRATION_SQUARED: The squared transformation amplifies the effect of the radius of gyration, which measures mass distribution. This non-linear transformation could help better distinguish vehicles with different structural properties (e.g., buses vs cars).

2. VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF: The difference between major and minor axis variances directly quantifies the directional dominance of shape variance. Vehicles like buses and vans typically have more elongated shapes compared to cars, making this difference potentially highly discriminative.

3. COMPACTNESS_TO_GYRATION_RATIO: This ratio combines boundary complexity (compactness) with mass distribution (gyration). Different vehicle types have distinct combinations of these properties - for example, buses tend to be both less compact and have different mass distribution compared to cars, making this ratio potentially very informative.

Reasoning:
1. SCALED_VAR_RATIO_SQUARED: The SCALED_VAR_RATIO is already a strong feature (appearing in the top feature combination). Squaring it will amplify its discriminative power, particularly for vehicles with extreme variance ratios (like elongated buses/vans vs more symmetric cars).

2. GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT: Both gyration and compactness are fundamental shape descriptors. Their product creates an interaction term that might reveal non-linear relationships not captured by their ratio (which is already in the top features). This could better distinguish vehicles with similar ratios but different absolute values.

3. VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF: The difference between major and minor axis variances directly measures shape elongation. Vehicles like buses and vans typically have much larger differences than cars (Opel/Saab), making this a potentially highly discriminative feature for the classification task.

   Reasoning: The kurtosis values for major and minor axes have very different ranges (176-206 vs 0-41), suggesting they capture fundamentally different shape properties. Their difference could highlight vehicles with particularly asymmetric tail distributions, potentially distinguishing buses/vans from cars.

2. <SCALED_VAR_MINOR_SQRT><sqrt><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><Square root transformation of scaled variance along minor axis to reduce skewness and make the distribution more normal, potentially improving model performance.>
   Reasoning: SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS has a wide range (184-1018) with Q1=321 and Q3=591.5, indicating potential right skewness. Square root transformation can help normalize such distributions and make relationships more linear with the target variable.

3. <ASPECT_RATIO_PRODUCT><multiply><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><Product of two different aspect ratio measures, creating a combined shape proportion feature that might better capture overall vehicle silhouette characteristics.>
   Reasoning: Both MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO capture different aspects of vehicle proportions. Their product could create a more comprehensive shape descriptor that distinguishes between elongated vehicles (buses) vs more compact ones (cars).

   Reasoning: The SCALED_VAR_RATIO is already a powerful feature indicating dominant direction of shape variance. Squaring it will emphasize extreme values, potentially making it easier to distinguish between highly elongated vehicles (like buses) vs more compact vehicles (like vans).

2. <GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT_LOG><log><GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT><Logarithm of the gyration-compactness product to handle the wide range of values and make the distribution more normal, which could improve model performance by reducing the influence of extreme outliers.>
   Reasoning: The GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT has a wide range (9632-29754) and high standard deviation. Applying a log transform can compress the scale and make the distribution more symmetric, which often benefits linear models and distance-based algorithms.

3. <COMPACTNESS_KURTOSIS_RATIO><ratio><COMPACTNESS><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS><Ratio of compactness to kurtosis about major axis, combining shape complexity with tail distribution characteristics to create a more discriminative feature for distinguishing vehicle silhouettes.>
   Reasoning: This creates an interaction between two fundamentally different shape descriptors - overall compactness and the peakedness of the distribution about the major axis. Vehicles with different silhouettes (e.g., boxy vans vs streamlined cars) should exhibit different relationships between these two properties.

   Reasoning: The SCALED_VAR_RATIO is already a powerful feature (appearing in top features). Squaring it will amplify its effect and capture quadratic relationships that might be more discriminative for the classification task, especially for vehicles with extreme aspect ratios.

   Reasoning: This feature has a large range (9632-29754) and is likely right-skewed (mean > median). Log transformation can compress the scale and make the distribution more symmetric, which often improves model performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scales and distributions.

3. <SCATTER_HOLLOWS_INTERACTION><multiply><SCATTER_RATIO><HOLLOWS_RATIO><Interaction between SCATTER_RATIO and HOLLOWS_RATIO, capturing how inertia properties and hollow area proportions combine to distinguish vehicle types, particularly useful for identifying complex shapes like buses.>
   Reasoning: Both SCATTER_RATIO (inertia ratio) and HOLLOWS_RATIO (hollow area proportion) describe different aspects of shape complexity. Their interaction might reveal patterns that neither feature alone captures, potentially helping to distinguish vehicles with similar overall shapes but different internal structures.

Reasoning:
1. SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS has a wide range (184-1018) and relatively high standard deviation (174.53). Applying a square root transformation will help reduce right-skewness and make the distribution more symmetric, which often benefits linear models and distance-based algorithms.

2. GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT has an extremely wide range (9632-29754) with high variance. Taking the logarithm will compress the scale and normalize the distribution, making patterns more discernible to machine learning algorithms while maintaining the relative ordering of values.

3. Creating an interaction between SCATTER_RATIO (inertia ratio) and HOLLOWS_RATIO (hollow area proportion) could reveal non-linear relationships that individually these features might not capture. The combination might better distinguish between vehicle types that have similar scatter patterns but different hollow characteristics, or vice versa.

Reasoning:
1. COMPACTNESS_CUBE: Since squaring COMPACTNESS was beneficial, cubing it might capture even more nuanced non-linear patterns. Vehicles like buses might have significantly different cubic compactness values compared to cars.
2. SCALED_VAR_RATIO_SQUARED: SCALED_VAR_RATIO is already a powerful feature. Squaring it will amplify the differences, making vehicles with highly directional variance (like long vans vs round buses) more separable.
3. GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT_SQRT: The product has a very large range and high variance. Applying a square root can compress the scale, normalize the distribution, and potentially make the feature more linearly related to the target, which often improves model performance.

Reasoning:
1. SCALED_VAR_RATIO_SQUARED: The SCALED_VAR_RATIO already shows good discriminatory power (as seen in the top features). Squaring it amplifies differences in variance dominance, which could help better separate vehicles with different shape characteristics (e.g., buses with high variance along one axis vs. more symmetric vehicles).

2. GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT_LOG: This feature has a wide range (9632-29754) and the product operation may create skewed distributions. Applying log transformation can normalize the distribution and reduce the influence of extreme values, potentially making patterns more discernible for the classifier.

3. ASPECT_RATIO_INTERACTION: Multiplying MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO and PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO creates an interaction term that captures combined elongation effects from different perspectives. This could be particularly useful since vehicles are viewed from different angles, and the combination might provide a more robust shape descriptor.

2025-09-02 17:40:25,266 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 2534, 'completion_tokens': 370, 'total_tokens': 2904}
2025-09-02 17:40:25,267 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SCALED_VAR_RATIO_SQUARED><square><SCALED_VAR_RATIO><Squared SCALED_VAR_RATIO to amplify the dominance of shape variance direction, which is crucial for distinguishing between elongated vehicles like buses/vans and more compact cars like Opels/Saabs.>
   Reasoning: The SCALED_VAR_RATIO feature already shows good discriminatory power (as evidenced by its inclusion in top features). Squaring it will emphasize higher values, potentially making it easier to distinguish vehicles with more elongated shapes (higher variance ratio) from more compact ones.

2. <GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT_LOG><log><GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT><Logarithm of the product term to handle its wide range [9632, 29754] and reduce skewness, potentially revealing more subtle patterns in the interaction between size distribution and shape complexity.>
   Reasoning: The GYRATION_COMPACTNESS_PRODUCT has a large range and standard deviation. Applying a log transform can normalize the distribution and make the model less sensitive to extreme values, potentially improving performance for vehicle types that cluster in different regions of this feature's distribution.

3. <SCATTER_RATIO_TO_COMPACTNESS><ratio><SCATTER_RATIO><COMPACTNESS><Ratio of scatter ratio to compactness, combining inertia distribution with shape density to create a feature that captures both rotational and areal properties of vehicle silhouettes.>
   Reasoning: This creates an interaction between SCATTER_RATIO (inertia distribution) and COMPACTNESS (shape density). Different vehicle types likely have distinct combinations of these properties - for example, buses might have high scatter ratio but moderate compactness, while vans might have different characteristics.
