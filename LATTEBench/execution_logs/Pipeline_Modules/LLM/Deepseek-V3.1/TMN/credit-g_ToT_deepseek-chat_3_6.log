You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [no checking, 0<=X<200, >=200, <0]

- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [critical/other existing credit, delayed previously, existing paid, all paid, no credits/all paid]
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [radio/tv, new car, furniture/equipment, used car, business, repairs, education, domestic appliance, other, retraining]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [276, 18424], Q1 = 1376.75, Median = 2359.5, Q3 = 4156.0, Mean = 3408.2433, Std = 2939.1116

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
