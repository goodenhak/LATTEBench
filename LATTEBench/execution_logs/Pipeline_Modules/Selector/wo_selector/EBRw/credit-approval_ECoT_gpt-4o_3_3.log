18. \[ f14 f5 f10 + + f14 f14 f8 * square + - minmax_scaler stand_scaler \]
19. \[ f8 f8 f14 f5 f8 + + - * cube quan_trans \]
20. \[ f14 f5 f8 + + f14 f10 + f14 f14 f8 * square + - reciprocal \]

These newly crafted features incorporate multiple transformations such as `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and operations like addition, multiplication, and the inverse, aiming to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between different features in potentially more informative state transformations. This proposed feature set could help improve the prediction task's performance by enabling the model to learn from more complex patterns in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 14:04:27,408 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictive performance, it's beneficial to build features that can represent non-linear relationships, interactions, normalization, and scaling of data. Given the context and the previous examples, we can design a new feature set, focusing on both non-linear transformations and interactions:

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f0 f0 *, f4 f9 tanh *, f1 f6 + f2 sqrt /]
```

Explanation:

1. **`f8 minmax_scaler`**: Min-max scaling of `YearsEmployed` to normalize the range, making it easier for models to learn.

2. **`f0 f0 *`**: Squaring `Gender`, potentially highlighting any interaction effects of gender by emphasizing its variance.

3. **`f4 f9 tanh *`**: The product of the `BankCustomer` feature and the hyperbolic tangent transformation of `Employed`, which captures non-linear relationships between having a bank account and employment status in a smooth gradient.

4. **`f1 f6 + f2 sqrt /`**: Combines and transforms features where `Age` and a categorical variable sum together and are divided by the square root of `Debt`. This could help in modeling interactions between age, ethnicity, and financial status.

These transformations aim to highlight more complex interactions or scale-dependent effects among existing features, potentially leading to improved performance for the credit card application prediction task.

The aim is to incorporate meaningful transformations that could influence the predictive power.

Here is a possible feature set combining concepts from both examples and some new transformations:

```plaintext

```

Explanation:
1. Retained transformations from prior sets that seem to capture interactions and useful nonlinear transformations, such as multiplication and trigonometric transformations.
2. Combined `reciprocal`, `sin`, `tanh`, and other non-linear transformations extensively to capture complex relationships within features.
3. Used `stand_scaler` and `quan_trans` to normalize and transform features to address skewness and non-normality.
4. Included a few new transformations, like `sqrt` and `log`, for features that might benefit from being smoothed or rescaled.
5. Retained core original features that are likely significant predictors of credit card application success, such as employment and prior default status.

This new set tries to maximize the diversity of transformations to capture a variety of potential relationships within the data, which could improve the modeling of the credit card application success prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 14:04:51,388 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that combines the transformation logic from the provided examples while striving to be better, we can use a mix of both basic and complex transformations. Here's a new set of features:

``` 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f13, f14, f8 reciprocal, f8 quan_trans, f5 f7 +, f2 f10 - sqrt, f9 f4 * sigmoid, f13 f13 cube minmax_scaler, f12 f7 f9 + reciprocal +, f10 f14 - log, f5 sqrt stand_scaler, f13 tanh]
```

In this feature set:
- We've retained several original features and elements from both examples to maintain baseline predictability.
- Used reciprocal and quantile transformation on `f8` for added insight.
- Added feature combinations like `f5 f7 +` to identify interactions between bank customer and years employed.
- Included complex interactions like `f2 f10 - sqrt` utilizing age and credit score differences.
- Included `f9 f4 * sigmoid` to explore the relationship between past defaults and marital status non-linearly.
- Used a combination of `cube`, `minmax_scaler`, and `tanh` for varied non-linear scaling on complex features for potential emergence of linear patterns.
- Applied `log` on specific features for better handling of highly skewed data. 

This new feature set attempts to capture diverse relationships and non-linear interactions while also learning meaningful interactions and scales from the data distribution.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

- I've replaced the `sigmoid` transformation with `tanh`, which is another non-linear transformation that can provide better differentiation in certain models due to its range of [-1, 1].
- Added additional interaction terms, such as `f1 f2 *`, `f3 f4 *`, `f4 f1 *`, and `f1 f9 +`, to capture any underlying relationships between specific features.

2025-09-28 14:05:14,527 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two examples you provided, I'll suggest a feature set that builds on the latter while potentially improving predictive quality and diversity in features.

To create a better feature set, I will keep some key transformations from the latter example and introduce a few more nuanced transformations that might capture intricate relationships between variables. I'll also diversify the mathematical operations used to enhance the feature interactions.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f2, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f8 reciprocal, f2 sigmoid, f5 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f7 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f12 sigmoid, f13 sigmoid, f14 sigmoid, f1 f0 *, f2 f0 *, f5 f0 *, f6 f0 *, f7 f0 *, f8 f0 *, f9 f0 *, f10 f0 *, f12 f0 *, f13 f0 *, f14 f0 *, f9 log, f10 log, f6 sqrt, f0 f4 /, f2 f5 -, f3 f7 +]
```

**Feature Explanation:**

1. **Reciprocal, Sigmoid:** These transformations provide non-linear relationships that can capture underlying trends in the data without being overly complex.

2. **Multiplication:** The interaction terms (e.g., `f1 f0 *`) capture interactions between key features that might align with credit card approval dependencies.

3. **Log Transformation:** Using a log transformation on `f9` and `f10` can manage skewed distributions and help in stabilizing variance, which may be necessary for features exhibiting exponential growth patterns.

4. **Square Root Transformation:** Applying square root transformation to `f6` can reduce skewness and handle features with an uneven distribution.

5. **Division and Subtraction:** Simple arithmetic operations like division and subtraction introduce interaction features that might capture essential interdependencies between the key features. 

6. **Addition of `f3 f7 +`:** Combining certain features with addition can merge relevant aspects of different variables, potentially highlighting individuals who meet specific credit card approval conditions.

2025-09-28 14:05:19,317 - INFO - llm output = Based on the analysis of the two feature sets you've provided, the key operations and transformations that lead to improved performance in predicting credit card application success are effectively utilizing feature interactions, scaling, and non-linear transformations. Here is a new feature set created by combining aspects from both examples, with an emphasis on creating a robust and informative set that should enhance predictive performance:

```

Here's the rationale for the selected transformations:

1. **Feature interactions and transformations** involving multiple features such as `f10`, `f14`, `f5`, and `f8`, produce complex interactions that can uncover hidden patterns, especially when combined with other transformations like `cube`.

2. **Scaling** using `minmax_scaler` can help standardize the data, making various features comparable and reducing the impact of outliers.

3. **Non-linear transformations** such as `sin`, `cube`, and `sqrt` are included for their ability to capture complex non-linear relationships between features.

4. **Simple reciprocal and division transformations** are used to stabilize variance and potentially reveal inverse relationships important in the context of credit card application success.

5. **Standard scaling** (`stand_scaler`) is applied to make sure features are centered around zero, where applicable, which is great for algorithms that benefit from normally distributed data.

- I've used reciprocal transformations for features where the inverse relationship might provide insights.
- I've combined features through addition and multiplication to capture interactions between them.
- I've used division operations to capture proportional relationships between features.

This involves capturing interactions, scaling, and transformations that could enhance the predictive power for the credit card application success task.

Here is a new proposed feature set:

```
[f8, f2 f8 *, f7 f8 *, f8 f2 *, f8 f10 *, f8 f14 *, f9 f14 *, f10 f14 *, f13 f8 *, f14 f10 *, f14 f8 square tanh /, f8 f14 f10 * + sqrt, f8 f2 f9 * + /, f8 f7 f10 * minmax_scaler, f8 f7 f14 * stand_scaler, f8 f10 f13 * stand_scaler, f8 f8 sin *, f8 f2 * reciprocal, f7 f8 * stand_scaler, f8 f10 * stand_scaler, f8 f14 * stand_scaler, f7 f8 * square, f8 f8 f2 * stand_scaler, f8 f8 f14 * reciprocal, f9 f14 square f8 f10 / +, f8 f2 f8 * tanh, f8 f7 f10 * , f8 f8 f2 cube / , f8 f8 f10 tanh /]
```

This feature set leverages products and transformations of different features, uses scaling, and applies non-linear transformations such as `tanh` and `square` to capture complex patterns in the data. Additionally, using operators like `reciprocal` and `stand_scaler` helps in adjusting the scale and variance of the features, possibly revealing more insightful relationships with the target variable.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Added Transformations**:
   - `f8 f8 * sqrt`: Taking square root of `f8` multiplied by itself can highlight some non-linear patterns for features where this operation makes sense.
   - `f14 log`: Log transformation could be beneficial especially for highly skewed features (such as those resembling income or scaled credit scores).
   - `f10 f14 + stand_scaler`: A scaled transformation of the summation of `f10` and `f14` may uncover interactions between these two transformed aspects of the feature set.

This enhanced feature set aims to offer a mix of multiplicative interactions and non-linear scaling which could contribute to capturing underlying patterns for the prediction task.

2025-09-28 14:05:55,059 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, it is essential to create a feature set that captures the underlying patterns in the data more effectively while maintaining the ability to learn complex relationships. To achieve this, the following transformed feature set incorporates a blend of non-linear transformations, interactions, and scaling techniques:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f0 f3 * ,f0 f4 * ,f1 f6 * ,f2 f10 * ,f6 f7 * ,f7 f10 + ,f2 f5 / ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f3 tanh ,f4 tanh ,f2 log ,f8 log ,f13 log ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f4 f6 + sqrt ,f9 cube ,f11 tanh ,f12 tanh ,f2 sigmoid ,f3 sigmoid ,f11 sigmoid]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Interactions and Polynomial Features:**
   - Including products and sums of selected features (e.g., `f0 f3 *`, `f0 f4 *`, `f2 f10 *`, `f6 f7 *`) can help capture potential interactions that may signify a higher likelihood of credit card approval.
2. **Non-linear Transformations:**
   - Applying transformations like `tanh`, `log`, and `sigmoid` to various features (e.g., `f3 tanh`, `f2 log`, `f11 tanh`, `f2 sigmoid`) introduces non-linear aspects that are beneficial for capturing complex patterns.
3. **Scaling Techniques:**
   - Normalizing feature distributions using `minmax_scaler` (e.g., `f13 minmax_scaler`, `f14 minmax_scaler`) ensures that all features contribute equally and mitigate the risk of dominance by features with a larger scale.
4. **Square Root and Cube Transformations:**
   - Applying `sqrt` and `cube` operations (e.g., `f0 sqrt`, `f4 f6 + sqrt`, `f9 cube`) allows the capturing of moderate and extreme non-linear effects, which can be instrumental in scenarios where relationships are not purely linear.
5. **Reciprocal Transformations:**
   - Employed in the given examples but not extended here, since concentrations on non-linearity and scaling have been prioritized.

This feature set leverages the most effective aspects of the previous examples while incorporating additional variety to maximize predictive power.

Here's an improved feature set inspired by the previous examples:

```

Explanation of the new transformations:
- `f8 f10 *`: Multiplying debt and credit score could highlight interactions between borrowing behavior and creditworthiness.
- `f12 f14 stand_scaler +`: Combining scaled citizenship status with income might help capture economic implications of differing civic statuses.
- `f6 f11 f13 * + cube`: Combining ethnicity, driver's license status, and zip code to give a complex interaction and then cubing it to emphasize variations.
- `f10 f14 sqrt + stand_scaler`: Summing the square root of credit score and income with standard scaling to aid in comparing financial capability.
- `f2 f7 f10 + /`: Summing years employed and multiplied credit score, then dividing by age to get a sense of financial maturity.
- `f9 f14 log + /`: Using logarithm for employed status paired with income to address income disparities in employment.
- `f14 f13 f2 * + reciprocal`: Reverse the interactions of these features to highlight relationships in sociogeographic aspects with income.
- `f10 f7 f8 * cube -`: Using interactions between credit score and years employed, cube the result, subtract debt to emphasize credit management against employment status.
- `f5 f6 tanh +`: Transform job sector and ethnicity using hyperbolic tangent for capturing nonlinear effects of job types and demographic aspects.
- `f3 f4 f11 + * reciprocal`: Combining marital status and bank customer status with driver's license to create a complex interaction, emphasizing legal and financial stability aspects.

These transformations aim to better encapsulate interactions and distributional changes within the dataset to facilitate the prediction task.

Here's a breakdown of the newly added features:
- **`f8 f10 tanh`**: Applies the hyperbolic tangent transformation on the product of features f8 and f10, which may capture nonlinear interactions.
- **`f14 log`**: Applies logarithmic scaling on feature f14 for handling skewed distributions.
- **`f12 f14 * minmax_scaler`**: Scales the product of f12 and f14 to the range [0,1] using min-max scaling, aiding models that benefit from normalized input.
- **`f13 f10 * tanh`**: Applies hyperbolic tangent on the product of f13 and f10, adding nonlinearity.
- **`f2 f14 cube`**: Cubes the product of f2 and f14 to capture higher-order interactions.

These transformations are intended to uncover hidden patterns in the data and improve model performance for predicting credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Changes and rationale:
1. Retained existing meaningful feature transformations.
2. Removed redundant feature `f10 f0 /` as it's not present in the better set and doesn't add new value to the set.
3. Added a new feature `f0 f9 f8 + sig`, which might capture non-linear interactions utilizing the sigmoid function, potentially useful considering the predictive nature of feature `f8` (Credit Score) and `f9` (Drivers License).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

In this new feature set, I've attempted to:

- Include transformation techniques such as logarithmic, reciprocal, square root, cube, min-max scaling, standard scaling, and others to capture non-linear relationships.
- Experiment with feature combinations and interactions that may reveal influential patterns such as combining multiple features and applying advanced transformations like cube or exponentiation.
- Leverage basic statistical transformations like sine, cosine, and tanh that can sometimes help with periodic or fluctuating data.
- Utilize division and reciprocal functions for creating meaningful rates, especially with the new features derived.
- Keep variations and combinations suited to potentially highlight subtler patterns in the data.

This set aims to have a broader exploration of potential derivations that may better model the complexity of factors influencing credit card application success.

```

In this feature set:
- I've combined existing transformations like square root (`sqrt`), hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`), standard scaling (`stand_scaler`), and min-max scaling (`minmax_scaler`), which may help in normalizing and reveal relationships in different scales.
- I've included multiplicative interactions between some features to capture potential interaction effects, like `f2 f5 *` and `f4 f6 *`.
- Applied transformations like cube for select interactions to capture joint nonlinear dependencies (`f1 f13 cube`, `f2 f14 cube`).

- Core numeric features like f2, f5, f7, etc., are retained from both examples.
- Combination and transformation features like `f7 cos`, `f14 cos`, and `f3 f8 + cos` are maintained for their potential nonlinear relationship capture.
- Some of the interactions and operations from the second example, like `f8 f2 *`, `f9 f2 *`, and `f4 tanh`, are included to capture potential interactions and non-linear relationships.
- Additional operations like `f7 f8 +`, `f11 cos`, and `f13 sin` are proposed for potentially capturing additional meaningful interactions and variations in the data.

   - Used simple mathematical operations such as addition and subtraction followed by transformations like `cube`, `sqrt`.
   - Applied `sin` and `stand_scaler` to capture cyclical trends or normalize the data, which can be crucial for improving model interpretability.
   - Created feature interactions (e.g., `f0 f7 f9 + *`) to explore interactions between multiple features, possibly highlighting complex relationships.

These transformations and combinations aim to balance between retaining useful features and adding new potential insights, thereby improving the model's ability to predict credit card application success.

2025-09-28 14:08:07,087 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples of new feature sets, let's create a feature set incorporating valuable transformations and operations that capture more information or relationships that could improve prediction performance.

Here's the improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f5, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f5 f14 +, f9 f5 square +, f14 f14 * square, f10 f14 f8 + + sin, f10 f14 f5 f8 + + - reciprocal cube, f14 f14 f8 * f5 f6 + + square - cube, f4 sin f13 /, f7 square, f8 square, f2 f8 /, f8 f9 * minmax_scaler, f13 f14 / log, f14 f2 / reciprocal, f5 f8 f7 * + minmax_scaler]
```

**Explanation:**
1. The feature set uses basic features (e.g., `f5`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, `f13`, `f14`) to ensure that original data representation is not lost.
2. Operations like addition, multiplication, squaring, and cube are used to capture potential non-linear relationships in the features.
3. Operations like `sin` and `log` are used on combinations of features to derive new features that could reveal cyclical patterns or logarithmic relations.
4. Use of transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `reciprocal` is emphasized to naturally scale or invert features where appropriate.
5. Recursive combinations of features (such as `f10 f14 f5 f8 + + - reciprocal cube`) are leveraged to create depth and intricacy in feature relationships.

These transformations aim to enhance the model's ability to discern complex patterns within the dataset and inform better predictions about the likelihood of successful credit card applications.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's the new feature set:

In this feature set, I've kept and adapted interesting multiplicative and standalone features from both examples, and incorporated a range of transformations such as `reciprocal`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, and combination transformations possibly capturing complex interdependencies between features. Implement these transformations to test their predictive power on the downstream task.

2025-09-28 14:08:34,208 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, it seems that combining multiple transformations and engineering new features from the existing ones can potentially improve the predictive power of the feature set for the downstream task of predicting successful credit card applications.

Here's a new feature set inspired by the given examples, aiming to provide an enhanced representation:

```plaintext
[f2, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f3 sigmoid, f0 quan_trans, f0 cube, f4 stand_scaler, f0 square, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f11 reciprocal, f13 reciprocal, f4 square sqrt, f3 sigmoid sqrt, f0 f0 * sqrt, f7 cos, f3 cos sqrt, f0 quan_trans sqrt, f1 f4 /, f8 f2 /, f7 f2 /, f0 sqrt, f3 f0 cube +]
```

In this feature set:
- Basic features are retained (f2, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14).
- Transformed features using statistical transformations (e.g., sigmoid, reciprocal, stand_scaler, square, cube) are emphasized to capture non-linear relationships.
- Square roots and cosine transformations of selected features are included to introduce non-linear transformations.
- Some interaction terms are generated by combining and transforming multiple features, e.g., `f3 f0 cube +`, to capture interactions between features that could be indicative of patterns related to credit card application success.
- The `quan_trans` and `reciprocal` transformations are used strategically to handle skewness and scale features.

This approach provides a comprehensive set of engineered features, capturing a variety of interactions and transformations that could improve prediction performance.
