```

Here's a brief explanation of my choices:
- I included core features like `f1`, `f2`, `f4`, `f7`, `f8`, and `f9` directly as they are important variables.
- I kept and slightly tweaked some of the composite features from the examples to maintain their unique contributions.
- Introduced nonlinear transformations like `tanh` and `sigmoid` to capture complex relationships.
- Used `quan_trans` on `f9` for a potential improvement in scale-sensitive variations.
- Multiplied significant features like `f6` and `f7` and applied `sqrt` on `f10 f7 *` to capture polynomial relationships.
- Continued to use operations like `sqrt`, `cube`, and others that help in normalizing and stabilizing variance.

These transformations are intended to capture more complex interactions and non-linearities from the data, potentially improving the model's predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

1. Focus on complex transformations of key features like `f8`, `f9`, and `f10` due to their potential relationship with heart disease indicators such as exercise-induced angina, old peak, and major vessel count. 

2. Use a mix of non-linear transformations (e.g., `sqrt`, `cos`, `sin`, `cube`) and scale transformations (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) to account for different distributions and scale effects.

3. Utilize interaction terms to explore potential synergistic effects between features.

Here is a potential improved feature set:

We will aim to create new informative transformations while considering potential interactions and non-linear relationships among the features. Here's a new feature set combining and building upon the previous ones:

In this new feature set:
- I've included a range of transformations: `minmax_scaler`, `log`, `reciprocal`, `tanh`, `cube`, `sin`, `cos`, `sigmoid`, and `square`
- Considered normalized and scaled versions of features using `minmax_scaler`.
- Combined and leveraged non-linear transformations like `sqrt`, `square`, `log`, and `reciprocal` to capture different aspects of feature distributions.
- Used trigonometric functions like `sin` and `tanh` to account for potential periodic relationships.
- Employed `sigmoid` to squash the feature space into a bounded range which may help for models that assume inputs in certain ranges.

This feature set aims to capture a wide range of potential non-linear relationships and interactions within the data.

- Used `square` on `f8`, `sqrt` on `f7`, and `reciprocal` on `f4` to highlight specific influential features.
- Applied `minmax_scaler` to `f2` to normalize values in the context of its range.
- Utilizing trigonometric transformations (`sin`, `cos`) to explore cyclical patterns in features such as `f3`, `f10`.
- Applied `stand_scaler` on `f4` to ensure it's centered and scaled, possibly overcoming issues related with extreme values or skewed data.
- Appended product and division interactions to find synergies between features that might denote health anomalies or typical values (`f0 f9 *`, `f1 f8 *`, `f2 f7 *`, `f5 f6 *`, `f9 f4 /`, `f8 f4 /`).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-22 10:33:52,182 - INFO - llm output = Selecting the best transformation methods is essential for improving model performance in predicting heart disease presence. The second feature set demonstrates an increased use of complex transformations and interactions compared to the first set. This suggests a more advanced approach to feature engineering, which can capture non-linear relationships and complex interactions between features.

Incorporating the strengths of both examples, here's an enhanced feature set:

- [f0, f2, f4, f7, f9, f10, f2 f0 /, f9 log, f3 log, f8 square, f7 sqrt, f4 reciprocal, f3 sin, f10 cos, f11 tanh, f6 quan_trans, f2 minmax_scaler, f5 f10 *, f2 f0 *, f8 f3 +, f8 quan_trans, f4 log, f7 log, f9 minmax_scaler, f8 sigmoid, f0 f3 f10 * + sqrt, f8 cube, f3 log f9 log +, f4 reciprocal f8 cube *, f6 quan_trans f7 sqrt +]

This feature set combines simple transformations and interactions with more advanced statistical techniques. The use of interactions (e.g., f5 f10 *, f2 f0 *, f4 reciprocal f8 cube *) allows the model to capture complex dependencies among the features, enhancing predictive accuracy. Additionally, advanced transformations like logarithms, cubes, and specific scaling methods are used to stabilize variance and handle non-normal distributions effectively.

Key changes and justifications:
- Retained `f2`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10` as they seem fundamental in most transformations. 
- Included transformations like `f4 quan_trans` and `f2 sigmoid` which tend to normalize and scale features non-linearly, potentially enhancing their predictive power.
- Involved complex manipulations like `f9 cos f2 cos + sqrt` and `f10 quan_trans f2 cos + sqrt`, which might capture non-linear relationships.
- Kept `f8 f9 +` and added `f8 f9 + sqrt` to explore potential interactions and non-linear scaling.
- Used `f8 cube` to capture higher-order relationships.
- Included powerful transformations from the latter set like `f10 f12 - f2 f2 * +` and its scaled variants `quan_trans`, `sqrt`, and `stand_scaler`, as they seem significant in capturing complex interactions and variances.

This set aims to balance raw features, linear transformations, non-linear scaling, and interactions, potentially enhancing model performance for heart disease prediction.

2025-10-22 10:34:01,716 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set for predicting the presence of heart disease, we need to combine relevant transformations from both example sets and incorporate additional meaningful features. We can leverage transformations that help in standardization, scaling, and adding non-linear interpretations. Here's a suggested improved feature set:

In this feature set:
- We keep essential raw features like `f0` (age), `f1` (sex), etc., which are crucial for prediction.
- Apply `sqrt`, `log`, `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans` for normalization and scaling which could help improve linear or non-linear model performance.
- Use trigonometric transformations and squares for capturing non-linear relationships between features.
- Utilize combinations of features added with their transformations which might capture interactions that are predictive of heart disease.

2. **Root and transformations**: Using square root and reciprocal to reduce skewness and bring in non-linear relationships.
3. **Combining features**: By multiplying and dividing, we capture interactions between potentially related features.
4. **Standard scaling and quantile transformations**: To normalize ranges and enhance the learning algorithm's performance.
5. **Tanh & interaction terms**: Leveraging `tanh` for adding non-linearity and computing interactions with substantial core features, allowing the model to learn sophisticated patterns.

```

- Combined effective transformations from both sets such as logarithmic and trigonometric functions which could better reveal nonlinear relationships.
- Included feature interactions like `f7 f10 cos *` and `f9 f4 reciprocal *` to potentially uncover complex interactions influential for the prediction task.
- Retained normalization and scaling transformations like `f4 stand_scaler`, as these are essential for many machine learning algorithms to perform optimally.

```

**Explanation**:
- Included basic feature transformations like square roots and interactions between transformed features that might provide additional insights into complex relationships.
- Combined features that involve resting blood pressure (f10) and maximum heart rate achieved (f7) through various interactions, as these could have a significant impact on heart disease prediction.
- Emphasized interactions between cholesterol (f2) and other features where transformations are done, as cholesterol levels are crucial in cardiac health assessment.
- Preserved some basic transformations from the previous sets where it made sense to maintain continuity and because certain transformations like square root and their interactions can often reveal non-linear relationships.
- More sophisticated combined transformations of features like f9 (ST depression) and f7 (maximum heart rate) with others to offer better insight into their combined effects.

By designing such feature combinations, we can aim to capture any underlying patterns missed by the original features alone, thereby potentially improving predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-22 10:34:26,893 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set from the provided examples, we'll combine the most informative transformations that could capture non-linear relationships and enhance the predictive power. Keeping operations relevant and varying allows exploring different aspects of the data:

1. Use square root transformations to reduce skewness and handle non-linear effects.
2. Incorporate trigonometric functions (cos and sin) where necessary to capture cyclical or wave-like patterns.
3. Apply scaling functions such as minmax_scaler to normalize features for improved model performance.
4. Integrate sigmoid function for bounded transformations when appropriate.

Here's a potential feature set inspired by both examples:

```

This feature set extends the previous transformations by introducing additional scaling and normalization techniques, potentially leading to more robust predictive performance regarding heart disease presence.

**Explanation:**
- Kept key features like `f2 (chest_pain)`, `f9 (exang)`, `f8 (oldpeak)`, and `f10 (ca)` which seem directly relevant to heart disease.
- Retained transformations `cos`, `sqrt`, and more complex transformations like `cube`, `quan_trans`, and `sigmoid` which might capture non-linear relationships.
- Brought in combination features like `f8 f9 +` and interaction terms like `f2 f0 * sqrt` which may capture interdependencies.
- Maintained `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` to standardize features thereby reducing computational complexity and feature range variability.
- Focused the final set on potentially informative compound transformations and combinations, attempting to balance between original features and their transformations to synergize insights.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Including `f10 * f12 - f2 f2 * + cube` to explore nonlinear interactions further by cubing the expression.
- Retaining useful operations like `f4 quan_trans sigmoid` and `f8 sqrt sigmoid` which combine transformations and non-linear scalers known for improving classification tasks.

#### Explanation
1. **Existing Features**: We retained several key features and transformations from both sets, focusing on varied mathematical transformations and scaling.
2. **Combining and Extending**: Introduced combinations of transformations such as `f8 f9 minmax_scaler +` and `f2 f9 / log`, which could provide nonlinear insights.
3. **Leveraging Different Operations**: Use of a broad range of transformations such as `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, `minmax_scaler`, and `log` ensures capturing different data distributions and relationships.
4. **Diverse Interactions**: Included interactions among features, such as multiplying and adding combinations, which can help model complex interactions between base features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

 ```

### Key Additions and Rationale:

- **Combining Features:** I've included interactions like `f3 f7 *` and `f8 f4 / sqrt` to capture non-linear interactions that may exist between features and influence the prediction.
- **Transformation Techniques:** Certain features like `f3 log` and `f4 reciprocal` are retained due to their ability to normalize skewed data and mitigate the impact of outliers, respectively.
- **Creation of New Features:** Features such as `f2 stand_scaler sqrt`, `f8 tanh` are intended to add depth by emphasizing their non-linear characteristics.
- **Dimensionality Reduction-Transformations:** Including `f9 sqrt tanh sqrt` and `f8 log` can help in preserving the essential information of those features while reducing dimensionality.
- **Expression Variability:** Including both `f0 f9 *` and `f1 f8 *` can capture multiplicative interactions between some of the primary numeric features, further enriching the model's capability.

You can modify and experiment with these transformations according to your specific dataset and model needs.

2025-10-22 10:35:16,570 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using the provided examples, let's focus on several transformations that may improve the model's ability to predict the presence of heart disease. The target here is to leverage the beneficial transformations from the previous examples like square root, tanh, and quantile transformation while discarding redundant or less informative operations and introducing new combinations if possible:

Here is a new feature set example combining beneficial transformations:

```plaintext
[f2, f8, f9, f10, f2 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f2 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f4 stand_scaler, f9 quan_trans tanh, f10 quan_trans, f4 sqrt tanh, f8 sqrt quan_trans, f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt sqrt]

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Maintain original features: `f2 (chest_pain)`, `f8 (exang)`, `f9 (oldpeak)`, `f10 (slope)` as these categorical features provide critical information for heart disease predictions.
   
2. **Square Root Transformation**: 
   - `f2 sqrt`, `f8 sqrt`, `f9 sqrt`, `f10 sqrt`, and additionally `f7 sqrt,` applied to numerical features like `f7 (thalach)` and `f4 (chol)` for variance stabilization. Also includes deeper transformations like `f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt` to introduce variety in numerical data representation.
   
3. **Tanh Transformation**:
   - `f2 tanh`, `f8 tanh`, `f9 tanh`, `f10 tanh`. The tanh transformation is helpful for bounding within (-1, 1) and handling skewed distribution.
   
4. **Stand_scaller, Quan_trans**:
   - Applying standard scaling and quantile transformation where appropriate: `f4 stand_scaler`, `f10 quan_trans`, `f9 quan_trans tanh`. These can improve the model when intolerant to non-standard distribution or outliers.
   
5. **Combination of Transformations**:
   - Finally using combinations: `f4 sqrt tanh` to examine interaction across transformations.

These choices aim to refine the input data to enhance predictive capabilities by utilizing transformed and scaled features and ensuring neither redundancy nor loss of critical information.

2025-10-22 10:35:32,136 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, the goal is to create a better feature set by leveraging and combining the given operations and features. Here is a proposed new feature set, which aims to be more informative:

Key adjustments and motivations:
1. Retained original features (f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12) to ensure baseline information is preserved.
2. Added f3 log and f9 log to capture non-linear relationships potentially useful for understanding complex interactions.
3. Used transformations such as square, sqrt, reciprocal, and tanh on selected features to enrich the data representation with non-linear interactions.
4. Minmax scaling should capture normalized distributions on f2 and f4 to ensure comparability across features.
5. Enhanced interactions with simple arithmetic combinations such as f4 f3 + and f9 f4 /.
6. Utilized square and sqrt transformations on more features (f8, f9) for further non-linear interactions.

This feature set combines approaches from both previous examples while also integrating interactions that could lead to better modeling performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Additional interactions like `f10 sqrt f2 cos +` and `f8 f2 cos +` strengthen interaction effects.
- Included new transformation `f4 tanh` to model saturation effects from feature `f4`.

- Combines different features in interesting ways (e.g., sums, products, divisions) to capture potential interactions between features.
- Incorporates combinations of features using scaling and transformations to normalize input variables which can stabilize and improve model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-22 10:35:57,409 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, I’ll create a new feature set that combines and potentially enhances the relevant transformations to improve the prediction task. The aim is to capture varied transformations that could help in better understanding the underlying data structure and its relationship to heart disease.

Here's the improved feature set:

```

```

Enhancements:
1. Retained most features from both sets considering transformations like `sqrt`, `cos`, `cube`, `+`, `square`, and more, as they often help in capturing non-linear relationships.
2. Included complex transformations like `f2 f0 * sqrt`, `f10 sqrt f2 cos +`, and `f2 f6 * sqrt` to explore interactions between features.
3. Kept transformations like `quan_trans` and `sigmoid`, as they help in normalizing the feature spaces, potentially aiding in model convergence and prediction.
4. Excluded redundant or less informative features after evaluating their presence and variance across the instances.

```

### Explanation
1. **Feature Selection**: 
   - Retained base features like `[f2, f9, f8, f10]` as these likely represent core attributes.
   - Kept combinations and transformations like `f2 cos`, `f8 sqrt`, `f9 sqrt`, `f8 cube`, etc., which may capture nonlinear relationships or distributions in the data.

2. **Enhanced Combinations**:
   - **Mathematical Operations**: Features like `f8 f9 +` and `f9 square` can capture interaction effects potentially important for predicting heart disease.
   - **Statistical and Machine Learning Transforms**: `f2 cos quan_trans`, `f9 minmax_scaler`, and similar standardizing and scaling transformations help in normalizing data distribution which can improve model performance.
   - **Logarithmic and reciprocal operations**: They can deal with skewness or to minimize impact of extreme values, e.g., `f9 square reciprocal`.

3. **Novel Features Introduced**:
   - `f9 square reciprocal`: This provides an alternative perspective on the scaling and transformation of feature `f9`.
   - `f8 sqrt f9 *`: A derived feature from interactions of square root of `f8` and `f9`, capturing potential multiplicative interaction effects.

These decisions are based on the idea that better feature representations can enhance model interpretability and predictive accuracy by capturing a wider range of underlying data patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f2, f4, f8, f9, f10, f2 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt, f9 reciprocal, f9 quan_trans tanh, f4 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f10 sqrt stand_scaler, f9 tanh stand_scaler, f2 f9 *, f8 f9 *, f2 f10 *, f3 f9 /, f4 f10 /, f8 f8 +, f9 f9 +, f9 f10 +, f4 stand_scaler f8 sqrt *, f2 tanh f9 sqrt sqrt -] 
[f2, f8, f9, f10, f2 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f2 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f4 stand_scaler, f9 quan_trans tanh, f10 quan_trans, f4 sqrt tanh, f8 sqrt quan_trans, f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt sqrt]

2025-10-22 10:36:11,505 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! In this context, we aim to generate new features by applying transformations to existing ones, potentially uncovering patterns that improve the prediction of heart disease. We’ll attempt to combine useful elements from existing feature sets and improve upon them.

Here's a new feature set:

``` 
[f2, f4, f8, f9, f10, f2 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f9 reciprocal, f9 quan_trans tanh, f4 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f2 f10 *, f4 f10 /, f10 sqrt tanh, f8 tanh stand_scaler, f2 f9 sqrt *, f8 sqrt quan_trans, f2 tanh f9 sqrt sqrt -, f9 f10 +]
```

**Explanation of the improved feature set:**

1. Retained important transformations such as `f2 sqrt`, `f9 reciprocal`, and `f9 quan_trans tanh` as they can potentially reveal non-linear relationships. 
2. Included scalers: `f4 stand_scaler` and `f10 stand_scaler` to normalize features for numerical stability and model efficiency.
3. Created interaction terms like `f2 f10 *` and `f2 f9 sqrt *` (feature interactions can capture relationships between features that are not linear).
4. Kept `f10 sqrt tanh` and improved it with `f8 tanh stand_scaler` for better feature normalization.
5. Simplified some combinations ensuring mathematical operations remain numerically stable and interpretable.

This feature set attempts to balance between raw features, their transformations, interaction terms, and ensuring numerical stability to help improve prediction accuracy for heart disease.
