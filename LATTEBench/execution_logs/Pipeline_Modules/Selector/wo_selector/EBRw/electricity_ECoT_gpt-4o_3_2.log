you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

1. Retained direct features for `f3` which represents `nswprice` as it's critical for the task.
2. Utilized multiple interactions and transformations involving `f3` to help capture its non-linear relationships.
3. Applied the tangent hyperbolic transformation `tanh` and quantile transformations to `f0` for capturing non-linear trends and seasonality effects, which are optimal for time series data.
4. Combined min-max scaling with interaction terms to improve the scale compatibility of features used in multiplicative interactions.
5. Included subtraction and sine transformations from the second feature set to capture volatility and cyclic patterns in the data.
6. Calculated feature products and their subsequent transformations to generate intricate patterns which might be informative for the prediction task.

This new set aims to maximize the feature interactions while capturing non-linear and cyclic effects to better predict the label.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2025-10-30 11:02:54,964 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set according to the provided examples, we need to generate features that capture more complex interactions and transformations on the original data. The second example introduces subtraction with `f1` (day of the week), which may help capture seasonality effects or periodic patterns in the data. It also uses quantile transformation, which can help make the data more robust to outliers and non-linear relationships.

Here is a refined feature set that combines and builds upon the ideas from both examples, while introducing additional powerful transformations:

```
[f0 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f0 f1 - ,f2 f1 - ,f3 f1 - ,f4 f1 - ,f5 f1 - ,f6 f1 - ,f0 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler]
```

Here’s a breakdown of the transformation choices:
- `f0 sqrt`: Taking the square root can linearize relationships involving power laws.
- `minmax_scaler`: Normalizes features to be within a specified range (e.g., 0 to 1), which may help improve model performance.
- `f0 f1 -`: This subtraction captures how date values change relative to days of the week, introducing seasonality.
- `quantile transformation` from the second example was modified to `minmax_scaler` to try other normalization methods that preserve the data distribution while scaling it to a known range.

This new feature set incorporates a variety of transformations and interactions that are likely to enhance predictive performance by capturing non-linear relationships and accounting for periodicity in the dataset.

2025-10-30 11:03:22,734 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and transformations, I will create a more refined and potentially informative set of derived features. Here's a better feature set combining and extending the ideas from the previous examples:

- Use a mix of transformations like reciprocal, min-max normalization, etc., to enhance feature relationships.
- Introduce new non-linear transformations, where appropriate (e.g., applying both linear transformations and non-linear like tanh or sigmoid to uncover hidden patterns).
- Combine features in new ways rather than always relying on individual transformations.

Here's a better feature set:

``` 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, 
 f0 reciprocal, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, 
 f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler,

 f1 f5 /, f4 f6 * tanh, f2 f0 / reciprocal, f5 sigmoid, 
 f0 square minmax_scaler, f2 sqrt, f3 log, f4 cube]
```

In this feature set:

- Each original feature (`f0` to `f7`) is retained for generalizable patterns.
- Key transformations like `reciprocal`, `minmax_scaler`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `/` (division), and arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`) are used to explore different feature relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-30 11:03:36,907 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, let's combine strategies from both given feature sets and introduce broader transformations to increase feature diversity and potential for capturing complex patterns in the data.

Considering the provided features and transformations, here's a proposed feature set:

[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f0 minmax_scaler sqrt, f3 minmax_scaler sqrt, f5 minmax_scaler sqrt, f0 sin, f5 sin, f2 cos, f5 cos, f0 quan_trans sin, f3 quan_trans sin, f5 quan_trans cos, f2 f0 * f5 minmax_scaler * tanh, f1 f0 + f4 sqrt, f1 f3 + f5 sqrt, f2 f3 * f2 f5 * +, f3 f3 minmax_scaler * sqrt]

### Explanation:

1. **Keeps original features (f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6)**: To ensure that raw signals are not lost.
2. **MinMax Scaling and Sqrt (f0 minmax_scaler sqrt, f3 minmax_scaler sqrt, f5 minmax_scaler sqrt)**: Provides a way to capture relative scaling differences effectively and may help in variance stabilization.
3. **Trigonometric Transforms (f0 sin, f5 sin, f2 cos, f5 cos)**: Useful for capturing cyclical patterns potentially present in time-related variables.
4. **Quantile Transformation with Sine and Cosine (f0 quan_trans sin, f3 quan_trans sin, f5 quan_trans cos)**: Combines non-linear transformations with smoothing characteristics of trigonometric functions.
5. **Interaction Terms with Non-linear and Smoothing Transforms (f2 f0 * f5 minmax_scaler * tanh)**: To capture latent interaction effects between variables in a non-linear way.
6. **Combinations with Non-linear Transforms (f1 f0 + f4 sqrt, f1 f3 + f5 sqrt)**: These transformations help uncover latent structure and potential multicollinearity.
7. **Complex Interaction (f2 f3 * f2 f5 * +)**: Introduces a complex interaction between multiple variables, potentially capturing latent relationships more effectively.
8. **Retained Effective Transformations (f3 f3 minmax_scaler * sqrt)**: A prominent effect from both provided feature sets effectively captured with min-max scaling combined with square-root transformation. 

This combination introduces valuable transformations to capture underlying patterns, ensuring a comprehensive capture of both polynomial and cyclical interactions.

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Feature Transformations:**
   - Continue using basic mathematical transformations such as `sin`, `tanh`, `quan_trans`, `stand_scaler`, and others to coax more informative representations out of the raw data. For instance, `tanh` can help in scaling values between -1 and 1, making them easier to learn from.

2. **Combination of Features:**
   - A feature like `f3 log` can provide insights into multiplicative relationships especially valuable for trading/economic data.
   - Combining transformations, such as `f3 tanh` with a reciprocal of another feature, can help in understanding the relative impact of those features jointly.
   - Using arithmetic operations, such as division or multiplication of transformed features like `f0 sin /` or `f3 quan_trans * f6`, could reveal subtle statistical correlations.

3. **Normalization Techniques:**
   - Employ different normalization techniques (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) to control the distribution spread and variance, especially `stand_scaler` for features with varying distributions or trends.

4. **Unique Combinations for Insight Extraction:**
   - Generating features like `f4 tanh * f1` enables us to explore potential signal interactions. These subtle feature intertwining gives flexibility of interpretation in complex environments.

Through these enhancements, we aim to enrich the information captured by feature sets and refine predictive capabilities possibly impacted by intricate inter-feature relationships.

- `f3 , f0 , f2 , f5`: Include the core features (New South Wales price, date, period, and transfer) to serve as baselines.
- `f0 f3 *` and `f2 f5 *`: Capture interactions between New South Wales price with date and period with transfer, which might reveal dependencies over time and during specific periods.
- `f3 f5 *`: Capture interaction between New South Wales price and transfer to observe if price depends on electricity flow.
- `f0 f3 +` and `f2 f3 -`: Simple arithmetic interactions to see linear dependencies and relationships.
- `f3 tanh` and `f5 tanh`: Non-linear transformations that handle new South Wales price and transfer.
- `f0 stand_scaler`, `f3 stand_scaler`, and `f5 stand_scaler`: Standardizing crucial features could help segmentation of data.
- `f0 minmax_scaler`, `f3 minmax_scaler`, and `f5 minmax_scaler`: Min-max scaling can help keep features within 0-1 for learning algorithms sensitive to magnitude, aiding in stability.
- `f0 reciprocal` and `f3 log`: Transformations on date and New South Wales price to address skewness and multiplicative relationships.

Changes and additions made:
- Added back `f1 sigmoid` and `f1 sqrt` from the first feature set as they provide non-linear transformations that map input values into meaningful ranges.
- Added `f3 f4 + f5 * sqrt`: This combines `f3`, `f4`, and `f5` in a way that captures interaction between price and demand, followed by a square root transformation.
- Added `f6 f7 / tanh`: This computes a ratio between `f6` and `f7`, followed by a `tanh` transformation, which may help capture potential relationship dynamics in the transfer features. 

These transformations are intended to create more complex representations that could capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features that are potentially relevant to the task of predicting price changes.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-30 11:05:00,760 - INFO - llm output = To provide a better feature set based on the given examples, let's focus on leveraging transformations that capture nonlinear interactions and complex patterns. Here is a suggested feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f0 sin, f2 cos, f3 tanh, f4 sigmoid, f5 log, f6 sqrt, f0 f3 + sin, f1 f4 + cos, f2 f5 * tanh, f3 f6 * sqrt, f4 f5 / sigmoid, f1 f0 + cube, f2 f0 + reciprocal, f3 f1 - stand_scaler, f4 f1 - minmax_scaler]
```

Explanation:
- We include a mix of nonlinear transformations like `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `log`, and `sqrt`.
- We leverage interactions between features by combining them using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- We enhance feature transformations by applying scaling and transformations like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` as needed.
- The focus is on exploring complex relationships between features to capture potentially unobserved patterns relevant to predicting the changes in NSW electricity prices.

The new feature set will aim to capture interactions and non-linearities between different features, which might be helpful for the downstream task of predicting whether the price change is UP or DOWN.

Here is the proposed feature set:

```

```

Explanation:
- Retained original features `f0` to `f7` as the base.
- Retained some previous transformations like square and sqrt for individual features to capture non-linear effects.
- Added interaction terms and applied transformations:
  - `f0 f2 * sqrt`: Interaction term capturing potential non-linear dependencies.
  - `f3 f5 * tanh`: Another interaction term that might highlight combined effects on price changes.
- Applied combination transformations:
  - `f0 f3 stand_scaler`: Standardization of a combined feature, potentially brings new insights.
  - `f4 f6 minmax_scaler`: Normalized combined feature to fit within [0, 1].
  - `f2 f3 / log`: Log transformation of a ratio to linearize multiplicative effects.
  - `f5 reciprocal`: Reciprocal transformation might capture inverse relationships.
  - `f7 sigmoid`: Sigmoid function applied to `f7`, good for squashing outputs to [0, 1], which might convert features into probabilities. 

By leveraging complex interaction terms and further transformations, this set might provide improved predictive power for understanding effects leading to price changes.

2025-10-30 11:05:31,324 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, I'll create a new feature set that incorporates the beneficial transformations from both. The goal is to enhance the feature set for the downstream task, leveraging what appears to be beneficial transformations like quantile transformation, squares, and some interaction terms.

Here's the proposed new feature set:

```

```

In this feature set:

- I've retained core features (f0 to f7) for baseline information.
- The square transformations are maintained for all numerical features (f0 to f7) as these can capture non-linear relationships.
- The square root transformation is applied not just to f1 but also to the interaction of f1 with other features like f0, f2, and f3, particularly with differences (f0 f1 -, f2 f1 -, f3 f1 -) to help capture nuances that might indicate shifts relative to the "day" feature.
- Quantile transformations are included, targeting some features to potentially normalize and make them more Gaussian-like, which can be useful for linear models.
- The existing beneficial interaction term f0 f3 + f0 f3 + / is included from the previous feature set for its potential added value.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This newly generated feature set combines:

1. **Basic Features**: Retain the original feature elements such as `f0, f2, f3, f4, f5` to maintain key raw data points.

2. **Transformations**:
   - **Tanh**: Applied to `f0, f2, f3, f5` using the `tanh` function, which can handle normalized data effectively and preserve positive and negative distinctions by stretching them between -1 and 1.
   - **Min-Max Scaling**: Applied to `f0, f2, f3, f5` for normalization purposes, enhancing scale comparability across features.
   - **Standard Scaling**: Applied to `f0, f3, f5`, giving robustness against outliers via centering and scaling.

3. **Additional Transformations**:
   - **Square Root**: Applied to `f4` and `f0` which can scale down larger values, potentially reducing the impact of larger magnitude features while preserving relative differences.
   - **Multiplicative Interaction**: The term `f3 * f5` introduces interaction between key features to capture combined conditional effects that might explain variations in target behavior.

These choices aim to diversify feature interactions and transformations while being mindful of scaling and normalization requirements, thereby enhancing model performance potential.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-30 11:06:17,896 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the given examples, I'll aim to extend the feature transformations by integrating non-linear operations and combining features in a way that might capture complex relationships better. Here's a new feature set that builds on the presented examples:

```

Additions and modifications include:

1. **Non-linear transformations**: Use of operations like `sqrt`, `log`, `sinh`, `cube`, `tanh`, and `minmax_scaler` to capture complex dependencies and variations.
  
2. **Combination of multiple features with operations**: Combine multiple features through arithmetic operations (`+`, `*`, `/`, `-`) to potentially uncover patterns that single features might not highlight.

3. **Statistical normalization**: Continued use of `quan_trans` and `stand_scaler` to help in normalizing the effect across various distributions.

This extended set should provide richer features for the downstream predictive task. Let me know if there are any specific constraints or further considerations to refine the feature set further.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In general, we want to focus on transformations that might capture non-linear relationships, interactions, and scaled versions of features. Here's a more sophisticated feature set:

```

]
```

Explanation:
1. Feature transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, and `tanh` can help in exploring non-linear relationships.
2. `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` provide normalization and standardization, which are useful for models sensitive to scale.
3. Interactive terms like `f0 f2 *` or `f4 f5 f3 * +` provide exploration of joint effects.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-30 11:07:34,370 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set further, let's incorporate elements from both examples to create a more comprehensive feature set that captures interactions, transformations, and adjusted scale values. The idea will be to expand the repertoire of transformations and interactions to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Here's the improved feature set using postfix expression:

```plaintext
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f0 f1 -, f2 f1 -, f3 f1 -, f4 f1 -, f5 f1 -, f6 f1 -, 
f0 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, 
f0 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, 
f0 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, 
f0 f3 + f5 +, f0 f3 * f5 *, f2 f4 + f5 +, f2 f4 * f5 *]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Basic Metrics:** Include original values of selected features to maintain interpretability (f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6).

2. **Diffs with `day`:** Using differences like f0 f1 -, etc., provides insights into variations from the weekly cycle.

3. **Standard Scaling:** Applying standard scaling on selected features to center and normalize their distribution (f0 stand_scaler, etc.).

4. **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Transformation:** Useful for squashing values into a smaller range, retaining differences for polarized observations (f0 tanh, etc.).

5. **Quantile Transformation:** Mapping features onto a uniform distribution to minimize effect of outliers and improve distribution (f0 quan_trans, etc.).

6. **Combined Interactions:** Feature interactions such as sums and products can capture joint effects and are synthesized across different features (f0 f3 + f5 +, etc.).

This set combines the standardization, distribution transformation, and interaction elements which should result in a robust design aiding predictive power improvements.

- Reuse reciprocal transformation to handle `f1`, capturing its inverse influence.
- Combine features `f3` and `f4` with a quantile transform to adjust for non-normal distribution.
- Utilize subtraction followed by standard scaling for `f5` and `f6` to capture deviations from mean behavior.
- Apply sin function followed by squaring to `f7` to capture periodic variations prominently.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-30 11:08:56,980 - INFO - llm output = To create a superior feature set from the given examples, we'll incorporate a combination of the most relevant and diverse transformations. The intent here is to capture different aspects of the data dynamics that can improve prediction. Considering both the previous examples, here's an optimized feature set:

```

In this feature set:
- Basic features (`f0` to `f7`) are retained for their raw information.
- Mathematical transformations and trigonometric functions (like `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `log`, `tanh`) are applied to capture non-linear relationships.
- Quantile transformation and standard scaling allow us to normalize and deal with different distributions.
- Interactions and scaling (`minmax_scaler`) of features capture interaction between different variables, which may reveal important patterns.
- A blend of diversified transformations from both examples is used to enhance feature variety.

2025-10-30 11:09:19,557 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature set examples, the task is to perform feature engineering by combining transformations and operations to generate a better feature set. The goal is to craft features that hold more predictive power for the downstream task, aligning with the concept of the label change relative to a 24-hour moving average.

Improving the predictive capability typically involves creating features that incorporate both individual and interaction elements between the existing features, as well as applying non-linear transformations to capture intricate patterns in the data.

Here's a proposed enhanced feature set, incorporating insights from both examples:

```plaintext

```

Explanation:

1. **Basic Transformations**: Applying trigonometric and logarithmic transformations such as `sin`, `cos`, `log`, and `sqrt` helps capture periodicity and non-linear relationships inherent in the data.

2. **Interactions and Scaling**: Incorporating interactions like `f7 * f6` (Victoria demand with transfer) and `f1 minmax_scaler cos` (day of the week) captures interdependencies and adjusts for scale effects.

3. **Complex Composite Features**: Using operations like `f3 * f5 quan_trans` and `f5 quan_trans tanh` integrates multiple transformations, offering greater fidelity in capturing complex relationships.

4. **Inverted Relationships**: Utilizing `f1 reciprocal sin` provides a perspective on inverse interactions that may reveal hidden patterns impacting predictions.

This feature set embraces diverse transformations to leverage underlying complexities in electricity pricing trends, demands, and scheduled transfers between states, hence enhancing the predictive potential.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-30 11:09:31,072 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set from the two given sets, we'll aim to combine their strengths and add transformations that might capture non-linear relations or interactions that were not fully utilized. We can use various transformations and combinations to create meaningful features that can potentially improve prediction performance. 

Here is the improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f3 f0 + f1 sqrt / ,f5 f3 + f6 tanh ,f0 square ,f2 square ,f3 quan_trans ,f0 f3 + f0 f3 + / ,f0 f5 + log ,f1 f5 f2 square * + ,f6 square ,f1 sqrt]
```

### Explanation:
- We retained the original features for baseline inclusion (`f0` to `f7`).
- We included interactions like `(f3 f0 + f1 sqrt /)` to explore the effect of combining features with square root transformation.
- Added a hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) transformation on an interaction `(f5 f3 + f6 tanh)` to capture non-linear effects.
- Used the `quan_trans` on `f3` as it was previously defined and allows for normalizing this feature distribution.
- Retained and modified meaningful transformations such as squared and log transformations that could reveal non-linear relationships or scale differences. 
- Combined original features with transformations (`f1 f5 f2 square * +`) to explore potential synergies and non-linear interactions.

This feature set leverages both traditional and advanced feature engineering methods to potentially enhance model performance.

2. **Quantile Transformation:** Applying quantile transformation (`quan_trans`) to `f0`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f5` to help in handling non-Gaussian distributed features and making them more Gaussian-like, which might be beneficial in some modeling approaches.

3. **Standard Scaler:** Used on `f3`, `f4`, and `f5` to normalize these features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

4. **Hyperbolic Tangent (`tanh`):** Applied to `f0`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f5`. The `tanh` function can help by squeezing input features to a range between -1 and 1, which could stabilize some algorithms.

5. **Min-Max Scaling:** Applied to `f3`, bringing it between 0 and 1 and possibly aiding algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

6. **Log Transformation:** Used on `f2` and `f5`, can help in transforming skewed data to a more normal distribution.

7. **Feature Interactions:** 
   - `f3 / f5`: Ratio of `nswprice` to `vicprice`, which could capture relative pricing trends between the regions.
   - `f0 * f2`: Interaction between `date` and `period`, which could capture trends or cyclic patterns.
   - `f4 - f5`: Difference between `nswdemand` and `vicprice`, potentially indicating demand-price interdependencies.

These transformations and feature interactions are intended to introduce non-linearities and capture underlying patterns to potentially boost model performance in predicting the target label.

```

### Explanation:

- **Retained Original Features**: Keeping existing features \( f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7 \) to preserve essential information.

- **Scaling Techniques**: 
  - Applied `stand_scaler` to \( f0, f3, f5 \) to normalize these features with respect to the standard distribution.
  - Applied `minmax_scaler` to \( f3 \) and `minmax_scaler tanh` to \( f3 \) as mixed scaling methods that can help capture different aspects of \( f3 \).

- **Mathematical Transformations**:
  - Used `sqrt` on \( f0 \) and `cos` on \( f1 \) to capture non-linear relationships.
  - Applied `log` to \( f2 \) and `reciprocal` on \( f6 \) to manage skewness and scale effects.
  - Applied `tanh` to \( f4 \) and \( f7 \) for non-linear transformations.

- **Combination of Transformation and Scaling**:
  - Combine `tanh` with `quan_trans` for \( f2 \) and `log` followed by `minmax_scaler` for \( f0 \) to explore complex interactions.

2025-10-30 11:10:34,034 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, the goal is to generate a better feature set by thoughtfully selecting and transforming features. The initial feature sets include various transformations such as differencing (e.g., \(f3 \, f1 -\)), quantile transformation (\(f3 \text{ quan\_trans}\)), and algebraic operations. The idea is to capture relevant information, variability, and nonlinearities that could help improve model predictions.

Combining the elements and transformations from both given feature sets, we can propose the following enhanced feature set:

```
[f3, f3 f1 -, f3 quan_trans, f0 f3 +, f0 f5 +, f3 f0 +, f3 f3 +, f3 f5 +, f3 f6 +, 
 f3 f0 f1 - +, f5 f0 +, f5 f3 +, f5 f0 f1 - +, f5 f2 f1 - +, f6 f3 +,

 f2 f6 * f5 +, f0 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans]
```

In this enhanced feature set:
- I kept key insights from both sets such as differencing with \(f1\), quantile transformation (\(quan\_trans\)), and various combinations between features to potentially capture interaction effects.
- Some transformations like square and cube are included to capture non-linear relationships.
- I made sure to retain adequate coverage of all base features that could provide distinct insights through transformations.

This feature set aims to leverage the diverse transformations available while carefully considering how these transformations could enhance the model's ability to capture patterns related to the label of interest.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f0 quan_trans ,f2 quan_trans ,f3 quan_trans ,f5 quan_trans ,f0 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f5 stand_scaler ,f0 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f0 quan_trans tanh ,f2 minmax_scaler]

2025-10-30 11:10:46,649 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and considering improvements from the second example, we can further enhance the feature set by adding additional transformations and interactions. Here is a better feature set:

```
[f0, f3, f5, f0 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f0 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f3 tanh, f5 tanh, f0 quan_trans tanh, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 sin, f5 sin, f0 quan_trans sin, f3 quan_trans sin, f2 cos, f3 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f0 quan_trans reciprocal, f3 sqrt, f5 sqrt]
```

This set includes additional trigonometric transformations (cos) and mathematical operations (sqrt, reciprocal) to introduce non-linearities and interactions among the features, potentially helping to uncover complex patterns in the data and improving model prediction.
