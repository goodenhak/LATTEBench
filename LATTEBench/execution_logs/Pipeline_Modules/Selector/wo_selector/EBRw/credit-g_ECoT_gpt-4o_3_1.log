2025-09-11 22:19:07,070 - INFO - llm output = Sure, I can help you enhance your feature set based on the examples provided. You want to optimize feature transformations that may improve predictive performance. Here's a better feature set based on your examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f4 ,f15 ,f0 f8 + ,f1 f8 + ,f2 f8 + ,f10 f8 + ,f15 f8 + ,f16 f8 + ,f17 f8 + ,f0 cube ,f1 cube ,f2 cube ,f3 cube ,f4 cube ,f5 cube ,f6 cube ,f7 cube ,f10 cube ,f11 cube ,f13 cube ,f15 cube ,f6 f8 + cube ,f11 reciprocal ,f0 f15 * ,f1 f15 * ,f5 f15 * ,f7 f15 * ,f9 f15 * ,f10 f15 * ,f11 f15 * ,f19 f15 * ,f0 f8 + f15 * ,f1 f8 + f15 * ,f2 f8 + f15 * ,f3 f8 + f15 * ,f6 f8 + f15 * ,f10 f8 + f15 * ,f11 f8 + f15 * ,f5 cube stand_scaler ,f10 f8 + cos ,f3 sqrt ,f14 tanh ,f8 sigmoid]
```

In this enhanced feature set, I added:
- `f3 sqrt` to capture any non-linear relationships with the square root transformation.
- `f14 tanh` to leverage hyperbolic tangent for non-linear dynamics, especially in bounded scenarios.
- `f8 sigmoid` to apply a logistic transformation, often useful for squashing values between 0 and 1, which can be helpful for classification tasks. 

These additional transformations can help capture complex patterns in the data, potentially improving model accuracy.

Here's a new feature set combining ideas from both examples:

```

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

In this new feature set:
- I've included a mix of basic and transformed features from both sets, aiming to have a broader range of interactions.
- I retained key transformations like `cube`, `sin`, and `cos`, which appear to capture complex relationships.
- I incorporated elements that use subtraction and trigonometric functions to potentially capture non-linear relationships.
- The inclusion of `sqrt` in combination with `cos` helps balance high-magnitude values that `cube` might introduce. 
- This set maintains diversity in transformations to ensure a rich feature space for modeling.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f17 minmax_scaler ,f18 minmax_scaler ,f19 minmax_scaler ,f18 f6 + tanh minmax_scaler ,f9 cos minmax_scaler ,f19 cos minmax_scaler ,f8 reciprocal minmax_scaler ,f16 f8 + reciprocal reciprocal ,f18 tanh ,f19 tanh]
```

In this new feature set:
- Basic min-max scaling is applied to various features to normalize them.
- Non-linear transformations like `tanh` and `cos` are applied to capture non-linear relationships.
- A combination of feature interactions using addition and transformation operations, such as `reciprocal`, is included to explore feature dependencies.
- Additional `tanh` transformations are added to different features for capturing further non-linear effects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's a new feature set based on your provided examples:

```plaintext

```

In this feature set:
- I retained original and direct transformations from the original features, ensuring a combination of basic arithmetic operations and more complex transformations (like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `sin`).
- Introduced interaction terms (like `f19 f18 * f8 f9 * /`) that might capture nonlinear relationships between features.
- Included scaling and normalization transformations (`stand_scaler`, `reciprocal`) as they can be crucial for some algorithms.
- Maintained diversity in methods to transform each feature, potentially enhancing predictive power.

2025-09-11 22:20:25,592 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature set examples, we can identify potential improvements and construct a new, better feature set. The new feature set should aim to improve the predictive performance by incorporating meaningful transformations and interactions.

Let's construct a new feature set based on the given examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f8 reciprocal f10 minmax_scaler +, f4 tanh sigmoid minmax_scaler f10 minmax_scaler +, f3 stand_scaler, f6 cube, f14 f18 *, f19 sqrt]
```

Explanation:
1. We retain features and combinations that were used in previous examples and apply transformations that could help improve model performance.
2. Feature `f3` (credit history) underwent standard scaling, potentially enhancing its impact as a normalized feature.
3. Feature `f6` (employment) was transformed using the cube operation to capture non-linear patterns.
4. The interaction between `f14` (existing credits) and `f18` (num_dependents) was created as a new feature using multiplication, potentially capturing interactions between credit number and dependents.
5. Feature `f19` (foreign_worker) was transformed using `sqrt`, potentially stabilizing variance and accommodating non-linear relationships.

This new feature set aims to provide potentially valuable transformations for a downstream task based on the original features and their transformations.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f9 tanh, f11 tanh, f19 f18 * tanh, f8 f0 -, f8 f1 -, f8 f3 -, f8 f4 -, f8 f5 -, f8 f10 -, f8 f11 -, f8 f14 -, f8 f16 -, f16 stand_scaler, f0 sin, f2 sin, f4 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f12 sin, f14 sin, f16 sin, f0 tanh sin, f1 tanh sin, f3 tanh sin, f4 tanh sin, f9 tanh sin, f11 tanh sin, f19 tanh sin, f9 f18 * tanh sin, f11 tanh cos, f8 f10 - cos, f9 tanh f9 tanh -, f19 f18 * tanh reciprocal, f19 f18 * tanh sin, f8 f14 - sin, f6 log, f7 f15 /, f0 square f1 square +, f10 cube, f19 f18 * f7 /]
```

In this enhanced set:

1. Applied `tanh` transformation to a wider range of features (f0, f1, f2, f3, f9, f11) to help with non-linearity and normalization of those features.
2. Added interaction terms by performing arithmetic operations like division and addition on different feature pairs (f7 f15 /, f0 square f1 square +) to capture complex relationships between features.
3. Introduced additional non-linear transformations like `log` for f6 and `cube` for f10.
4. Included new composite features derived from multiplication and division operations for a potentially richer feature space (e.g., f19 f18 * f7 /).

These adjustments aim to capture more complex patterns and interactions in the data, which could improve the model's predictive power for the downstream task.

2025-09-11 22:20:41,990 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, here's how you can create a better feature set by combining elements from both examples:

1. Begin with maintaining a diverse set of original features and some engineered features from the given sets.
2. Retain the features with demonstrated transformations that can enhance predictions.
3. Ensure the transformations are applied to multiple feature combinations to capture non-linear relationships.
4. Use scalers and transformations across multiple features to capture different types of data distributions.

Here's a new set that incorporates these ideas:

```
[f0, f1, f4, f6, f11, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18,

```

This improved set leverages combination features and various transformations across different features, including scaled combinations, trigonometric transformations, and cubes. Moreover, specific transformations like the stand_scaler and quan_trans are applied to engineered features to normalize and further transform the data, potentially enhancing model capabilities in capturing complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-11 22:20:54,139 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, we should build upon the transformations that may offer greater variability and potential information gain. Given that the latter example already includes more comprehensive transformations, we can enhance it by combining or introducing complex transformations. Here’s a revised feature set:

```
[f0, f4, f11, f13, f14, f16 f8 + reciprocal reciprocal, f18 minmax_scaler, f0 tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f12 tanh, f13 tanh, f14 tanh, f15 tanh, f16 tanh, f17 tanh, f18 f0 +, f18 f1 +, f18 f2 +, f18 f3 +, f18 f4 +, f18 f5 +, f18 f6 +, f18 f7 +, f18 f10 +, f18 f11 +, f18 f12 +, f18 f13 +, f18 f14 +, f18 f15 +, f18 f16 +, f18 f17 +, f10 tanh square, f14 stand_scaler, f16 f8 + reciprocal reciprocal quan_trans, f0 tanh square, f14 tanh square, f0 f3 * f10 tanh square +, f4 f12 / log, f16 f9 cos *, f14 f13 * sqrt]
```

**Explanation:**
- **Complex Interactions**: Added interactions between features such as `f0 f3 * f10 tanh square +` to potentially capture non-linear relationships.
- **Logarithmic and Trigonometric Transformations**: Introduced combinations of logarithmic and trigonometric functions like `f4 f12 / log` and `f16 f9 cos *` to transform the variables that could reveal hidden patterns.
- **Root Transformations**: Applied square root on product terms to balance scale differences, for instance, `f14 f13 * sqrt`.

2025-09-11 22:21:01,854 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, I'll consider combining transformation techniques and operations used in the previous feature sets that lead to feature enhancement and improved transformations. I will incorporate transformations such as hyperbolic tangent (tanh), sigmoid, stand_scaler, and others to capture non-linear relationships and scale features effectively. Here's a proposed improved feature set:

```plaintext

```
In this improved feature set, I incorporated a variety of operations including sin, tanh, and sigmoid transformations, and combinations that were shown to be beneficial in one or both of the previous examples. I've also added scaling operations like stand_scaler to standardize relevant features, which can help improve the performance of models by ensuring they have similar scales.

2025-09-11 22:21:07,855 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we should aim to improve the transformation complexity and diversity while also ensuring that the transformations are meaningful and potentially useful for feature engineering.

From the previous examples, the transformations included a mix of simple functions and scalers, as well as geometric transformations (cube, tanh) and trigonometric transformations (sin, cos). In creating a new set, we can consider leveraging more complex transformations that might capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

Here's a new feature set that builds on the given examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f18 cos f14 * ,f18 cos f18 sin * ,f0 f1 + sqrt ,f1 f2 - log ,f3 f4 * reciprocal ,f5 f6 / sigmoid ,f7 f8 + tanh ,f9 f10 - stand_scaler ,f11 f12 + f13 * minmax_scaler ,f14 f15 / cube ,f16 f17 * quan_trans ,f18 f19 + f14 / cube]
```

This feature set incorporates a variety of transformations:
- **sqrt**: Square root for reducing scale and handling non-linearity
- **log**: Logarithm to handle exponential relationships
- **reciprocal**: Reciprocal to transform based on inverse scaling
- **sigmoid**: For non-linear scaling from the logistic function
- **tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent for handling symmetric non-linearity
- **stand_scaler**: Standard scaling for normalization
- **minmax_scaler**: Min-max scaling for fitting data into a specific range
- **cube**: Cubing for accentuating growth
- **quan_trans**: Quantile transformation for handling non-parametric data

The transformations chosen aim to capture potential non-linear relationships and interactions in the data, which could be beneficial for downstream prediction tasks.

2025-09-11 22:21:25,075 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by leveraging transformations from both feature set examples, we can introduce more meaningful interactions and transformations. Here is a proposal of an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f4, f11, f13, f14, f16 f8 + reciprocal reciprocal, f18 minmax_scaler, f0 tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f12 tanh, f13 tanh, f14 tanh, f15 tanh, f16 tanh, f17 tanh, f18 f0 +, f18 f1 +, f18 f2 +, f18 f3 +, f18 f4 +, f18 f5 +, f18 f6 +, f18 f7 +, f18 f10 +, f18 f11 +, f18 f12 +, f18 f13 +, f18 f14 +, f18 f15 +, f18 f16 +, f18 f17 +, f10 tanh square, f14 stand_scaler, f16 f8 + reciprocal reciprocal quan_trans, f0 tanh square, f14 tanh square, f1 tanh cube, f0 log tanh, f13 tanh sqrt square, f4 f12 / log, f1 cube reciprocal, f0 f14 * reciprocal, f7 tanh sqrt sqrt, f14 f13 * sqrt sqrt]
```

### Justification:

1. **Combination of diverse transformations**: Both `tanh`, `square`, `cube`, and logarithmic transformations, among others, have been integrated to capture non-linearities and scale disparities.

2. **Meaningful interactions**: Introduced feature interactions such as `f0 f14 * reciprocal` to capture dependencies between features such as age and property_magnitude, or other relevant combinations that may exist.

3. **New transformations**: Increased transformation complexity, such as adding `sqrt` or additional scaling, to features that might benefit from increased variance or further polynomial feature expansion for better pattern recognition. 

By incorporating these strategies, the transformed feature set should provide a richer input space for downstream predictive models, potentially enhancing their ability to discern complex patterns and improving overall predictive performance.

I will aim to help with data normalization, nonlinear transformation, and interaction terms to capture complex relationships between the original features. Here is the new feature set:

### Justification:
1. **Feature Inclusion:** Retained features from the second example, which seemed more diverse and effective.
2. **Diverse Transformations:** Applied `stand_scaler` to `f1 tanh cube` to ensure effective scaling of this transformed feature, potentially improving its informative value for the prediction model.
3. **Maintained Variety of Transformations:** Both log and reciprocal transformations provide mechanisms to handle variable skewness and range, potentially improving model performance.
4. **Reducing Redundancies:** Focused on relevant features while maintaining critical nonlinear transformations, aiming to maximize relevance without excessive complexity.
5. **Transformation Consistency:** Ensured a consistent approach across similar feature transformations to effectively enhance capacity for capturing complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Explanation:
- Included features from both given sets to ensure base coverage.
- Retained advanced transformations like `reciprocal reciprocal` and `minmax_scaler`.
- Kept useful transformations such as `tanh`, `square`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `quan_trans`.
- Introduced two new features: `f4 f1 * tanh` and `f13 f5 square + minmax_scaler` to provide additional variability and complex interactions potentially useful for downstream tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

### Explanation of New Transformations:
- **f0 f1 +**: Adds two features together to account for any potential linear relationship.
- **f2 f3 ***: Multiplies two features to capture interactions between them.
- **f5 square**: Squares a feature to explore non-linear relationships.
- **f6 cube**: Uses cubing to amplify the feature's effect if relationships are highly non-linear.
- **f7 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling to ensure a standardized mean and variance, useful for models sensitive to feature scales.
- **f8 minmax_scaler**: Scales features to a specific range, typically (0, 1), which can be helpful for models that don't handle different feature magnitudes well.
- **f9 log**: Log transformation can be useful for reducing skewness and handling outliers.
- **f12 f13 f14 + ***: Combines linear features first and then multiplies, capturing interactions beyond pairwise.
- **f15 f16 /**: Divides two features to model proportion or rate-indicative relationships.
- **f18 sqrt**: Square root transformation to adjust the distribution symmetry or to lessen the impact of extreme values.
- **f19 sigmoid**: Sigmoid transformation is useful for scaling output between 0 to 1, especially for binary classification signal transformations. 

These additional transformations aim to enhance the dataset's capability to better serve downstream predictive models by revealing hidden data patterns and complexities.

### Explanation:
- Added `f1 f3 / tanh` to capture the interaction between these two features using division followed by a non-linear transformation.
- Added `f2 f10 * log` to model the interaction between these features through multiplication and a logarithmic transformation.
- Added `f11 f9 - cube` to potentially capture any subtractive interactions and amplify them with a cube transformation.
- Added `f0 f6 + sigmoid` to capture additive interaction effects with a sigmoid transformation, which can handle non-linear saturation.
- Added `f5 f7 * log` to model interactive effects using multiplication followed by a logarithmic transformation, potentially capturing unique data patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a possible new feature set using the format provided:

```

```

Here, I've added several transformations focusing on potentially significant interactions or nonlinear relationships:

- Used the operation `f0 f1 * sqrt`, which interprets the interaction between `f0` and `f1` in a non-linear manner.
- Maintained and expanded `tanh` and `sin` transformations, which can capture complex relationships.
- Added `log` transformation to feature interactions, which could help model multiplicative relationships effectively.
- Retained key features from Example 2 because they might offer straightforward relationships valuable for the decision-making process.

These features aim to capture both simple interactions and complex transformations that potentially represent underlying patterns predictive of credit approval in the dataset.

The goal is to capture relevant transformations and interactions that could improve model performance. Here's an improved feature set:

[f0, f4, f11, f13, f14, f16 f8 + reciprocal reciprocal, f18 minmax_scaler, f0 tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f12 tanh, f13 tanh, f14 tanh, f15 tanh, f16 tanh, f17 tanh, f18 f0 +, f18 f1 +, f18 f2 +, f18 f3 +, f18 f4 +, f18 f5 +, f18 f6 +, f18 f7 +, f18 f10 +, f18 f11 +, f18 f12 +, f18 f13 +, f18 f14 +, f18 f15 +, f18 f16 +, f18 f17 +, f10 tanh square, f14 stand_scaler, f0 tanh square, f14 tanh square, f1 tanh cube]

**Changes Made:**

1. **Removed repetitive transformations**: The second example is selected as the base since it removed unnecessary transformations from the first example.

2. **Retained complex interactions**: Kept the interactions between `f16` and `f8` and their transformations, as well as various `f18` interactions, due to their potential utility in exploring combinations of features.

3. **Emphasized on squared and cubed transformations**: Retained specific squared and cubed transformations as they might help capture non-linear relationships.

4. **Preserved normalization operation**: Used `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to ensure features are scaled, enhancing model learning.

This updated feature set maintains a diverse range of transformations to explore complex relationships while avoiding redundancy.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this version, two new features are created:
1. `f0 f1 + f14 tanh square * sqrt`: Combines the sum of features `f0` and `f1`, applies a `tanh square` to `f14`, and then multiplies and takes the square root.
2. `f3 f17 - cube`: Subtracts `f17` from `f3` and then cubes the result.

In this new feature set, I have included all original features, transformation of some features using cosine and sine functions, a log transformation to capture non-linearity, squared and tanh transformations for non-linear interpretations, and aggregated mathematical operations like addition and multiplication to produce potentially informative interactions. These changes aim to capture complex relationships and improve model prediction capabilities.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
