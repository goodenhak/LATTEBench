you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:46:48,213 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the given feature sets, we will leverage a combination of transformations that could provide insightful predictive power. We'll combine multiple transformations such as `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and other nonlinear transformations, and ensure they maintain a scalable output using transformations like `minmax_scaler` or `stand_scaler`. Additionally, we'll focus on generating new features that compound existing ones in a meaningful way.

Here's a proposed improved feature set:

```plaintext

 f0 f1 * f0 f9 + * tanh, 
 f0 f1 * f0 f9 + f5 f19 + * * tanh, 
 f0 f1 * f0 f19 + f1 * * tanh, 
 f0 sigmoid, f1 sigmoid, f2 sigmoid, f4 sigmoid, f5 sigmoid, 
 f6 sigmoid, f11 sigmoid, f12 sigmoid, f13 sigmoid, f14 sigmoid, 
 f15 sigmoid, f16 sigmoid, f17 sigmoid, 
 f4 f0 f9 + * square tanh sigmoid, 

// New features
 f0 f4 * f1 f9 * + stand_scaler tanh, 
 f4 f9 + f4 f5 f19 + + minmax_scaler sigmoid, 
 f1 f6 + f17 f14 - * tanh minmax_scaler, 
 f0 f5 f9 + cube tanh, 
 f2 f11 * f8 f17 + minmax_scaler tanh
]
```

These new features are intended to introduce non-linear interactions, scalability transformations, and combinations of existing important features. The approach is to capture complex relationships between variables that could enhance predictive accuracy in your downstream models.

In this feature set, I've incorporated a mix of nonlinear transformations (like `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`), statistical scaling (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`), and interaction terms represented as products, while maintaining diversity and avoiding over-complications that don't aid interpretability or prediction performance. The goal is to enrich the feature space with diverse characteristics such as linearity, variability, periodicity, and interaction effects while keeping computational efficiency in mind.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set:

- Basic transformations (e.g., `sin`, `tanh`) provide nonlinear features.
- Polynomial features and interactions between features provide potential new insights.
- Scaling techniques (e.g., `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) standardize value ranges.
- Additional operations such as `log` and `reciprocal` introduce further non-linear transformations.
- Inclusion of basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `/`) for interaction between features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:47:46,430 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, I'll aim to incorporate more informative transformations and possibly reduce redundancy by removing less impactful features. Here's an improved feature set:

```

In this improved set:
- I've retained many of the cosine and square root transformations, as they likely capture useful periodic or scaling information.
- Added transformations like `log` and `tanh` to bring out non-linear relationships.
- Included some scaling transformations with `minmax_scaler` to ensure features are on a similar scale, improving model training stability.
- Omit redundant combinations where they bring little unique information compared to others.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Given the transformations provided in the two examples, here is a new proposed feature set:

```

In this feature set, I have removed the redundancy of f12 square sqrt and added a new feature transformation, `f19 f4 - square sin`, which applies the sine function. This transformation is useful if the differences expressed by `f19 f4 -` are periodic in nature and can capture new patterns or insights.

We will merge beneficial elements from both examples and add a few potent transformations:

```

Explanation:

1. **Logarithmic Transformation:** Added `f0 log` to capture multiplicative relationships or suppress large deviations.

2. **Reciprocal Transformation:** Included `f2 reciprocal` as it can be useful for variables expected to have inverse relations.

3. **Standard Scaling:** Applied `f3 stand_scaler` to adjust features to a standard normal distribution, which can improve convergence in various algorithms.

4. **Square Root Transformation:** Extended `sqrt` to `f4`, `f5`, and `f8` to potentially reduce skewness.

5. **Interaction Terms:** Added `f0 f1 *` and `f6 f7 *` to capture potential interactions between features.

This enhanced feature set aims to better capture the underlying structure of the dataset while maintaining a broad exploration of transformations.

2025-09-30 11:48:38,399 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, the goal is to construct a new feature set that leverages useful transformations to improve prediction capabilities. The second example includes more complex interactions and transformations, suggesting a progression towards better feature engineering.

Here's an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f10, f0 cos, f10 cos, f0 f9 -, f0 f19 -, f1 f19 -, f2 f9 -, f4 f9 -, f7 cos f14 -, f0 cube, f2 cube, f0 cos cube, f0 f9 - cube, f0 f19 - cube, f1 f9 - cube, f1 cos sqrt, f2 cos sqrt, f0 f9 - cos, f7 cos f14 - cos, f2 f19 - cos, f4 f9 - cos, f3 cos, f0 f2 f9 - *, f1 f2 f9 - *, f1 cos f2 f9 - *, f10 cos f2 f9 - *, f15 f19 - f2 f9 - *, f17 f19 - f2 f9 - *, f7 cos f14 - f2 f9 - *, f0 cos sqrt f2 f9 - *, f2 cos sqrt f2 f9 - *, f4 cos sqrt f2 f9 - *, f12 cos sqrt f2 f9 - *, f0 cos sqrt, f10 cos sqrt, f2 cos sqrt sqrt, f0 cos cube sqrt, f0 f10 cos +, f3 f12 cos *]
```

In this improved version, I've chosen to keep many interactions and transformations from the second set, because they may capture more complex relationships and have shown to provide a richer feature space. The inclusion of additional interactions such as `f0 f10 cos +` and `f3 f12 cos *` helps in potentially capturing non-linear interactions between features, enhancing the model's expressiveness and potentially contributing to better predictions.

2025-09-30 11:48:47,381 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given two sets, I'll aim to incorporate the strengths of both and prioritize transformations that often help in improving prediction accuracy, such as combinations of feature transformations, nonlinear transformations, and scaling techniques.

Here's an optimized feature set combining both approaches:

``` 
[f0, f1, f4, f5, f15, f9 tanh, f19 tanh, f0 sigmoid, f2 sigmoid, f3 sigmoid, f4 sigmoid, f5 sigmoid, f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 tanh f18 +, f6 sigmoid f7 sigmoid +, f19 tanh f9 sin +, f11 sigmoid f9 tanh +, f0 sigmoid f12 sigmoid +, f1 sigmoid f15 sigmoid +, f9 f0 - stand_scaler square, f9 f5 - stand_scaler square sqrt, f19 f2 - square log, f10 f8 f13 + sigmoid minmax_scaler -]
```

Rationale:
- Retained linear and nonlinear transformations like `sigmoid` and `tanh` for their ability to handle skewed data.
- Included `stand_scaler` transformations, which normalize the features beneficial for many ML algorithms.
- Incorporated combinations of transformations (e.g., additions and scaling) to capture interactions between features.
- Retained and combined scaling with non-linear transformations to potentially enhance feature interpretability and usefulness.
- Included select difference operations which often help in highlighting contrasts between feature intensities.

2025-09-30 11:48:57,493 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new, improved feature set based on the given examples, I will consider including a broader variety of transformations and combinations that may capture more useful information. This includes the use of various transformations not previously applied and some existing transformations that have shown potential.

Here is the new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f4, f10, f0 cos, f1 cos, f4 cos, f10 cos, f0 f9 -, f1 f9 -, f2 f9 -, f1 f19 -, f3 f19 -, f7 cos f14 -, f0 cos sqrt, f1 cos sqrt, f4 cos sqrt, f10 cos sqrt, f5 cos sqrt, f7 cos f14 - minmax_scaler, f1 f9 - minmax_scaler, f0 cube, f1 cube, f2 cube, f4 cube, f0 cos cube, f3 cos sqrt, f12 cos sqrt, f2 f9 - cos, f15 f19 - cos, f7 cos f14 - cos, f1 cos cos, f10 cos cos, f12 f9 - cos, f13 cube, f11 cube]
```

This set emphasizes:
- Including both lower and higher-order transformations such as cosine, cube, and square root.
- Emphasizing transformations with subtraction (e.g., `f0 f9 -`) and minmax scaling to normalize values, which are retained for their diversity in representation.
- Adding new transformations like more `cos` on combinations to potentially capture periodic features that might be indicative in classification problems.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-30 11:49:19,244 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the feature set given, we should introduce further transformations that may capture nonlinear relationships or interactions within the data better. Given the features presented, I will construct a new feature set by introducing some additional transformations while maintaining the listed format:

```

In this updated feature set:

- I've added interactions such as `f6 f7 * tanh` to capture multiplicative interactions and applied a hyperbolic transformation.
- Applied a `minmax_scaler` transformation on `f13 f14 +` to scale sum features.
- Introduced `f15 cube sqrt` to explore polynomial transformations.
- Used both `reciprocal` and `log` on `f11` to better handle skewed data.
- Implemented a `sigmoid` transformation to induce non-linearity and normalize between 0 and 1 on `f9 f10 -`.
- Derived a hypothetical `cosine_similarity` for interaction between `f2` and `f3`.
- Captured logarithmic transformations on feature ratios (`f5 f0 / sqrt log`) for normalization.
- Combined `tanh` with `minmax_scaler` on an interaction of `f17` and `f16` for dynamic range adjustment. 

These transformations are selected to ensure deeper modeling of nonlinear relationships and potential interactions within the data.

**Explanation:**
- We kept some original feature elements for baseline information.
- Used both square and cube transformation for effective polynomial relationship modeling.
- Integrated log transformations which are effective for compressing data ranges and emphasizing smaller values.
- Retained sigmoid and tanh transformations known for handling non-linear relationships well.
- Optimized combinations of transformations (stand_scaler with square/cube, log transformations with subtractions) for better scaling and adjustment.
- Included a reciprocal transformation of a feature for an inverse relationship perspective.
- Enhanced feature engineering by stacking transformations from previous examples where relationships between variables could be indicative.

This feature set should provide a robust base for improving predictive performance in your modeling tasks.

To construct a new feature set, I will prioritize diversity and transformations that capture different aspects of the data while also drawing inspiration from both examples.

Here's an improved feature list:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f4, f14, f0 square, f9 f2 - square, f9 f4 - square, f4 stand_scaler square, f9 f0 - stand_scaler square, f9 f2 - stand_scaler square, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, f6 square, f7 square, f10 square, f11 square, f12 square, f13 square, f14 square, f15 square, f16 square, f17 square, f16 f16 /, f16 f19 f13 - square /, f19 f13 - square f16 /, f19 f13 - square f19 f13 - square /, f9 f0 - square square, f9 f1 - stand_scaler square square, f9 f1 - square cos, f9 f4 - square sqrt, f9 f5 - stand_scaler square sqrt, f19 f2 - square log, f1 square log, f19 f13 - square log, f9 f2 - stand_scaler square log, f9 f4 - stand_scaler square log, f9 f5 - stand_scaler square log, f9 f2 - square log, f0 square log, f8 cos log, f12 square sqrt, f9 f1 - tanh, f16 f19 f2 - sigmoid]
```

New features added in this set compared to the second example:

- `f9 f1 - tanh`: A hyperbolic tangent transformation of the difference between features which can help in normalizing data further, emphasizing mid-range values.
- `f16 f19 f2 - sigmoid`: A sigmoid transformation applied to the result of a subtraction which could help emphasize thresholds and nonlinear relationships in credit prediction.

These transformations are introduced with the presumption that they align with the nature of the downstream task, helping the model to potentially better capture non-linear and threshold effects in the dataset.

In this transformation:

1. **Added Transformation Operations**: Included `cube`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh` operations which are often used to normalize or handle non-linearities.

2. **Diverse Functions**: Incorporated a range of mathematical functions such as logarithms, cosine, sine, and square roots to capture different patterns.

3. **Incorporation of Mixed Operations**: Combined different operations like `square`, `log`, `sin`, and `cos` to enhance feature representation.

This new feature set not only builds on the previous transformations but also introduces more complex and diverse operations that can help in capturing complex patterns in the data, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Feature Redundancy and Relevance:** Removed redundant or less impactful transformations while preserving potentially informative transformations such as `square`, `stand_scaler square`, and `log` to capture non-linear relationships.

2. **Transformation Balance:** Retained a mix of basic features and transformed features like `square` and `stand_scaler square` to ensure a balance between complexity and interpretability of the feature set.

3. **Preservation of Key Operations:** Ensured that critical mathematical operations and transformations from both sets were included, especially those that likely capture essential variability and information in the data (e.g., `log` transformations for normalization and variance reduction).

By considering these key points, the new feature set aims to improve prediction capability for the task.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's an improved feature set:

```

```

In this version:
- I combined concepts from both provided sets.
- I used `square`, `sqrt`, and `log` transformations to capture non-linearities.
- I retained standardized features with `stand_scaler` and added `sigmoidsqrt` to introduce a blend of squashing and non-linear transformations.
- Added `-` (subtraction) combined with different transformations to provide potential feature interactions.
- Attempted to simplify overlapping transformations to enhance interpretability and performance on unseen data.

This version maintains a balance by including raw features with basic math operations, standardized transformations, and some non-linear activations, potentially improving downstream task model performance.

2025-09-30 11:50:20,159 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set considering the examples you provided, I'll aim to focus on reducing redundancy, enhancing expressiveness, and maintaining diversity in transformations. Here's a new feature set that aims to capture a good balance of transformations:

```plaintext

```

Here's a brief rationale for choosing these transformations:

1. **Diverse Base Transformations**: Retained basic transformations like `cos`, `cube`, and `sqrt` which can capture non-linear aspects.
   
2. **Cross-Product Features**: Features like `f0 f2 f9 - *` help capture interactions between various attributes which could be indicative of more complex patterns in the data.

3. **Combined Transformations**: Operations such as `f0 f9 - cube` and `f7 cos f14 - cos` explore more granular patterns by mixing base features with non-linear transformations.

4. **Scalers**: Included scaling operations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to normalize feature distributions which could improve the learning stability of downstream models. 

These selections aim to create a rich feature set that can contribute to better capture of underlying patterns in the prediction task.

[f0, f1, f4, f14, f0 square, f9 f2 - square, f9 f4 - square, f4 stand_scaler square, f9 f0 - stand_scaler square, f9 f1 - stand_scaler square, f9 f2 - stand_scaler square, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, f6 square, f7 square, f10 square, f11 square, f12 square, f13 square, f14 square, f15 square, f16 square, f17 square, f16 f16 /, f16 f19 f13 - square /, f19 f13 - square f16 /, f19 f13 - square f19 f13 - square /, f9 f0 - square square, f9 f1 - stand_scaler square square, f9 f1 - square cos, f9 f4 - square sqrt, f9 f5 - stand_scaler square sqrt, f19 f2 - square log, f1 square log, f19 f13 - square log, f9 f2 - stand_scaler square log, f9 f4 - stand_scaler square log, f9 f5 - stand_scaler square log, f9 f2 - square log, f0 square log, f8 cos log, f0 reciprocal, f14 minmax_scaler, f11 cube, f9 f4 - stand_scaler square tanh]
```

Key improvements made:
1. Added diverse transformations such as `reciprocal`, `minmax_scaler`, `cube`, and `tanh` to capture non-linear relationships and reduce skewness in data.
2. Maintained useful transformations from the previous sets, such as `stand_scaler`, `square`, `cos`, `sqrt`, and `log`.
3. Selected features for new transformations based on intuition of their potential non-linear impact on credit decision predictions.

Here's a new and improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f3, f0 cos, f1 cos, f4 cos, f10 cos, f0 f9 -, f0 f19 -, f1 f9 -, f1 f19 -, f2 f9 -, f2 f19 -, f4 f9 -, f12 f9 -, f15 f19 -, f17 f19 -, f7 cos f14 -, f0 cos sqrt, f2 cos sqrt, f4 cos sqrt, f10 cos sqrt, f12 cos sqrt, f14 cos sqrt, f0 cube, f1 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f11 cube, f13 cube, f0 cos cube, f10 cos cube, f0 f9 - cube, f0 f19 - cube, f1 f9 - cube, f1 f19 - cube, f1 cos sqrt, f5 cos sqrt, f0 f9 - cos, f15 f19 - cos, f1 f9 - minmax_scaler, f7 cos f14 - minmax_scaler, f0 f19 - reciprocal, f2 f19 - tanh, f0 f9 - log, f4 f9 - sigmoid]
```

Enhancements made in this feature set:
1. **Reciprocal Transformation:** Applied to `f0 f19 -` to capture inverse relationships, which can be useful in understanding the influence of distance-like metrics.
2. **Tanh Transformation:** Applied `tanh` to `f2 f19 -` because it can help squeeze the values to a range between -1 and 1, making it easier for certain models to predict.
3. **Log Transformation:** Applied to `f0 f9 -` to handle skewness and provide a better distribution for features that usually have exponential growth patterns or high variance.
4. **Sigmoid Transformation:** Applied to `f4 f9 -` to map values to a range between 0 and 1, which is useful for probability estimation or scaling features in a probabilistic manner.

These transformations aim to address potential non-linear relationships and improve the model's ability to capture hidden patterns for predicting credit eligibility.

2025-09-30 11:50:38,477 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the provided feature sets, I'll combine elements from both sets to create a more comprehensive and potentially more informative feature set. This involves selecting features that are likely to capture important patterns and interactions in the data, which can enhance the performance of a predictive model.

Here's the new feature set:

``` 
[f0, f1, f4, f5, f6, f14, f0 square, f9 f1 - square, f9 f2 - square, f9 f4 - square, f19 f0 - square, f19 f2 - square, f19 f13 - square, f0 stand_scaler square, f4 stand_scaler square, f9 f0 - stand_scaler square, f9 f1 - stand_scaler square, f9 f2 - stand_scaler square, f9 f4 - stand_scaler square, f9 f5 - stand_scaler square, f8 cos, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, f5 square, f6 square, f7 square, f10 square, f11 square, f12 square, f13 square, f14 square, f15 square, f16 square, f17 square, f16 f16 /, f16 f19 f13 - square /, f19 f13 - square f16 /, f19 f13 - square f19 f13 - square /, f9 f0 - square square, f9 f1 - stand_scaler square square, f9 f1 - square cos, f9 f4 - square sqrt, f19 f2 - square log, f1 square log, f19 f13 - square log, f9 f2 - stand_scaler square log, f9 f5 - stand_scaler square log, f8 cos log, f12 square sqrt]
```

Explanation:

1. I've kept a combination of raw features (`f0`, `f1`, `f4`, `f5`, `f6`, and `f14`) to ensure that we have baseline variables that can capture linear relationships.
   
2. I retained several non-linear transformations like squares, differences, and standard scaling, as they help capture non-linear relationships.

3. Cosine transformations and square roots are maintained as they can help normalize cyclical patterns and enhance feature diversity.

4. I've chosen logical combinations of existing transformations that help to explore feature interactions, which can be critical for predictive performance.

This approach involves combining features with transformations that may capture more nuanced relationships or non-linear patterns in the data. Here's a proposed improved feature set:

Key additions and modifications:
- Added `f9 f2 - square reciprocal` to capture inverse relationships.
- Applied `tanh` to `f4` after min-max scaling to map values between -1 and 1.
- Added `f2 cube` to capture cubic non-linear effects of `f2`.
- Applied `tanh` to `f12` for potential symmetric effects around 0.
- Created interaction effects like `f0 f4 + square` and `f2 f6 - sqrt` to capture complex relationships.
- Used `f9 f11 * square` to exploit interaction followed by squaring between selected features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:51:01,538 - INFO - llm output = To generate an improved feature set from the given examples, we'll consider the transformation operations that provide nonlinear transformations, interactions, and normalizations, while trying to maximize diversity and potentially useful features for predictive modeling. Here's one possible better feature set:

```

In this improved feature set, additional transformations such as `minmax_scaler`, `reciprocal`, `cube`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `sqrt` are included to capture different aspects of the data distribution and interactions that may be valuable for predictions. Note that I've retained a diverse set of transformations from the previous sets while also incorporating new forms to increase the richness and potential predictive power of the feature space.
