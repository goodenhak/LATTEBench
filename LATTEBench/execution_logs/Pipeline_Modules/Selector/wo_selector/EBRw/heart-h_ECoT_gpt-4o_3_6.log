When comparing two sets of engineered features, focus on diversity and the potential for capturing complex relationships. Let's enhance the given feature sets to create a better feature set:

1. Keep the diversity of mathematical operations to explore various transformations.
2. Incorporate interaction terms to represent nonlinear relationships.
3. Consider computational simplicity for efficient model training.

Here's a new feature set based on the given examples:

- Ensures broad coverage of original data transformations, including square root, logarithmic, and reciprocal.
- Incorporates feature interactions (e.g., multiplication, addition) that might capture complex patterns.
- Utilizes scaling techniques, which are crucial for handling varying ranges across features.

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Feature Transformations:** I've retained some basic transformations such as `sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and `minmax_scaler` applied to various features. These can help normalize data, reduce skewness, or handle non-linear relationships.

2. **Feature Interactions:** I've introduced interactions between features, such as `f0 f3 *` and `(f2 f8 * f9 +)`, which are followed by transformations like `sqrt` to possible capture higher order interactions.

3. **Complex Combinations:** 
   - A novel combination is `1 f9 tanh - f7 *`, which involves applying the hyperbolic tangent function, useful for smoothing out extreme values, and then applying a scaling subtraction. This may help with stabilization across different patients.
   - Another is `f8 f7 f9 + * sqrt sqrt`, combining multiple features to observe interaction effects followed by stabilization with square root transformations.

These transformations and combinations aim to uncover non-linear relationships and interactions in the data that may be hidden otherwise, potentially improving model predictive power for the heart disease presence task.

```

This feature set includes various scaling and transformation techniques such as `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `sigmoid`, and combines them with the existing features to explore non-linear relationships, smoothing effects, or magnified interactions. Additionally, operations like subtraction and multiplication amongst transformed features can help reveal correlations or dependencies that are not apparent from the original features alone.

This representation builds upon the previous examples by emphasizing a diverse set of transformations. It introduces new computational features like logarithmic and reciprocal, which can often reveal linear relationships, and scaling strategies like min-max and standard scaling, which normalizes the dataset to handle outliers or varying ranges effectively. These transformations aim to uncover hidden patterns or relationships between features to potentially improve the prediction of heart disease presence when supplied to a machine learning model.

[f2 , f7 , f8 , f9 , f10 , f2 sqrt , f7 sqrt , f8 sqrt , f9 sqrt , f10 sqrt , f8 f7 sqrt - sqrt sqrt sqrt , f8 sin sqrt f9 - sqrt sqrt sqrt , f8 sqrt sqrt sqrt , f10 sin sqrt sqrt , f1 sqrt , f12 sqrt , f3 sqrt , f7 sqrt , f7 log , f1 square , f2 square , f7 square , f10 square , f10 sqrt square , f9 square , f8 f7 sqrt - sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt , f8 sin sqrt f9 - sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt , f8 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt , f8 log , f9 log , f10 log , f8 f7 sqrt - sqrt sqrt sqrt square , f8 sin sqrt f9 - sqrt sqrt sqrt square , f8 sqrt sqrt sqrt square]
```

In this feature set:
- I retained useful transformations from the previous examples.
- Added logarithmic transformations for more features to help with normally distributed variables and prevent skewness.
- Included interaction terms by using differences and the product of features along with some non-linear transformations to capture more complex relationships. 
- Each feature has multiple transformations to explore various types of interactions and relationships that could be predictive for heart disease.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

1. Focus on a set of base features (`f2`, `f7`, `f8`, `f10`) that are related to important predictors like serum cholesterol, resting heart rate, and exercise-induced angina.
   
2. Incorporate transformations that can represent non-linear relationships (e.g., square roots, multiple nested square roots) which might help highlight meaningful patterns in the data while maintaining complexity to a manageable level.

3. Include interaction terms that involve combinations of transformed features (`f2 sqrt +`, `f7 sqrt f8 +`, `f8 sqrt f2 sqrt +`) in order to capture potential interactions between these variables that could be indicative of heart disease presence.

4. Ensure utilization of square roots to dampen potential effects of extreme values and enhance interpretability (`f8 sqrt`, `f9 sqrt`, `f10 sqrt`).

By focusing on transformations and interactions of core features, this set should provide a robust basis for predictive modeling in the context of heart disease detection.

2025-10-22 11:00:56,402 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set for predicting the presence of heart disease, let's focus on combining and transforming features to capture potentially useful interactions and relationships. The goal is to leverage nonlinear transformations and interactions that might highlight important patterns in the data. Here is an improved feature set based on the given examples:

```
[f2 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f2 sqrt ,f7 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f2 f3 - ,f5 f7 - ,f8 f3 - ,f9 f7 - ,f10 f3 - ,f10 f7 - ,f2 sqrt sqrt ,f8 sqrt sqrt ,f9 sqrt sqrt ,f10 sqrt sqrt ,f2 square ,f2 sqrt square ,f9 sqrt square ,f10 sqrt square ,f2 f3 - square ,f7 sqrt sqrt ,f8 f3 - square ,f8 sqrt square ,f8 square ,f8 reciprocal f7 reciprocal *, f2 sigmoid f9 sigmoid +, f10 sqrt f7 sqrt *, f8 tanh f3 minmax_scaler *, f5 log f7 log +]
```

In this feature set, some considerations include:
- The use of reciprocal interaction between features `f8` and `f7`, potentially highlighting inverse relationships.
- The sigmoid transformation can help capture nonlinear relationships while keeping values bounded, which can be useful especially when combined in interactions with other features.
- The tanh transformation is used to handle non-linearity and can help in normalizing extreme values, while combining it with `minmax_scaler` ensures values are confined within a desirable range.
- Log transformations are added to emphasize relative changes between features `f5` and `f7`, capturing multiplicative effects and smoothing.
  
These transformations aim to uncover interactions and hidden patterns among features that could be critical for accurately predicting heart disease presence.

2025-10-22 11:01:08,191 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for predicting the presence of heart disease, it's important to leverage domain knowledge and statistical transformations that could enhance the predictive power. Let's enhance the provided feature set by incorporating additional transformations and possibly reducing redundancy. Here's a revised feature set proposal using various transformations:

1. **Incorporate logarithmic and reciprocal transformations:** These can help handle skewed distributions or provide insights into exponential relationships.

2. **Add interaction terms:** These terms capture multiplicative effects between features, which might reveal combined influences on the target variable.

3. **Suddenly removing redundancy:** Some features might be redundant, and it's essential to ensure each feature contributes uniquely to the predictive task.

Here's the improved feature set:

```python
[f2, f7, f8, f9, f10,
 f2 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt,
 f2 log, f7 log, f8 log, f9 log, f10 log,
 f2 f8 *, f9 f10 *,
 f2 f3 -, f5 f7 -, f8 f3 -, f9 f7 -,
 f2 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal,
 f7 sqrt sqrt, f8 f3 - square, f8 sqrt square, f8 square,
 f2 cube, f9 cube]
```

### Explanation:
- **Logarithmic and Reciprocal Transformations:** Adding `log` and `reciprocal` can help transform non-linear relationships into linear ones, making it easier for models to learn.
  
- **Interaction Terms:** These terms (`f2 f8 *`, `f9 f10 *`) might capture joint effects of different variables that individual variables cannot explain alone.
  
- **Redundancy Removal and Enhancement:** I've included transformations that are likely to provide unique insights like `cube` without repeating similar operations too much, hence reducing redundancy and potentially enhancing model performance.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Here are the additions and modifications made:
- Added `f0 f2 * sqrt` to capture interaction between age and chest_pain, which could be significant.
- Added `f1 f9 - sqrt sqrt` to explore the relationship between sex and exercise-induced angina in relation to heart disease.
- Added `f7 f10 * sqrt sqrt` to capture interaction between maximum heart rate achieved and ST depression, potentially valuable in predicting heart disease presence.

These transformations aim to enhance feature interactions and non-linear patterns that might be instrumental in predicting heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

The inclusion of operations like `log` aims to stabilize variance, and by using combinations such as `f10 f8 sqrt sqrt sqrt * f2 sqrt sqrt +`, we attempt to capture interactions between features that may not be evident if considered in isolation.

### Explanation:
- **Logarithms and Square Roots:** Using log and square roots helps handle skewness in continuous features and can reveal multiplicative relationships.
- **Tanh and Sigmoid Transformations:** These are useful for non-linear modeling and help in transforming features to an interpretable range.
- **Min-Max Scaler:** This is useful for bringing features to a standard range, which can be particularly helpful when combining features.
- **Complex Interactions:** By combining different features with operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, we consider potential interactions that may capture underlying relationships related to the target.
- **Recursive Transformations:** Intentionally using recursive transformations (like multiple `sqrt` operations on a single feature) can help in cases where higher-degree roots may bring out useful properties or stabilize variance across the transformed space.

This new feature set attempts to retain the flexibility of complex feature transformations while maintaining coherence and possibility for interpretability.

This post-fix expression incorporates various non-linear transformations such as `sqrt`, `tanh`, `cos`, and `sin`, which can discover hidden patterns within the data. Additionally, feature combinations capturing potential interactions (e.g., `f2 f3 f8 * /`) and scaling/normalizing operations (`minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`) are included. These transformations can help uncover relationships that are non-linear, scale-independent, or involve interaction terms, potentially leading to improved prediction accuracy for heart disease presence.

We should aim to create meaningful and possibly non-linear relationships that could help in better prediction of the target variable.

Here is a new feature set suggestion:

```

```

In this feature set:

- Added `f2 log f3 log -` to capture differences in logarithmic scale.
- Added `f9 reciprocal f10 reciprocal +` for interactions between the reciprocal values.
- Added `f8 stand_scaler f7 stand_scaler *` for interaction at a standardized scale.
- Added `f2 quan_trans f9 quan_trans +` to incorporate quantile transformation and capture non-linearities.

These additions should help capture complex patterns and relationships in the data, potentially improving prediction performance.

In this formulation:
- Combinations and transformations like multiplication and division (e.g. f2 f7 * f8 /) can explore interactions of different variables.
- Using `sqrt` and `minmax_scaler` can normalize and adjust the variation between high-value features.
- Elucidating non-linear relationships via `tanh` and `sigmoid` functions helps capture complex patterns.
- Derived features from core measurements like `f2`, `f8`, or `f10` through various transformations identify critical insights.

- Features are scaled using `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to ensure they are on a similar scale, which can be beneficial for some machine learning algorithms.
- We have added some combinations that may capture more intricate relationships between features, potentially improving model performance for heart disease prediction.

**Explanation**: 
1. Retained meaningful differences like `f2 f3 -` which may capture relative differences useful for prediction.
2. Explored non-linear transformations such as square, square root, sigmoid, tanh, which can help capture non-linear relationships that might exist in the data.
3. Introduced feature interactions, scales, and combinations that combine different features, while trying to transform them into potentially more informative representations (e.g., `f10 f9 * f3 f2 / sqrt`).
4. Improved on transformations by potentially stabilizing them via mathematical functions like `sin`, `cos` in specific combinations, typically useful in feature extraction tasks.
5. Made use of previously useful transformations and built on them by applying additional operations to achieve a new feature with more potential.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Integrate min-max scaling and standard scaling in combinations to maintain feature scaling consistency.
- Preserve and extend features based on subtraction and addition to capture linear relationships and patterns.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
