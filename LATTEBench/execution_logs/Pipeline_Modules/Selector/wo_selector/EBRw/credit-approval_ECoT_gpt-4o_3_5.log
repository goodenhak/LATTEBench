The aim is to leverage a combination of the transformations that captures complex interactions, preserves variance, and exploits non-linear relationships. I'll be adding some insightful features while enhancing complexity and variability:

```plaintext

 f3 f4 f7 * cube / ,f5 f6 + f12 log / ,f11 sigmoid f3 log * ]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Retaining Core Features**: The core features (`f0` to `f14`) are retained for continuity and coverage.
2. **Non-Linear Transformations**: Using transformations like `quantile transformer`, `sigmoid`, and `cube` to handle non-linearity and scale variance.
3. **Combining Features**: Mathematical operations involving multiple features to explore potential interaction effects (e.g., `f14 f8 * f10 f8 * +`).
4. **Preserving Balance**: By combining features and maintaining operations like `sin`, `log`, and `tanh`, the feature set is made robust for a variety of learning algorithms.
5. **Integrating Advanced Stat Treatments**: Use of `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quantile transformer` to normalize the impact of irregular distribution or outliers.

This new feature set is crafted to capture a spectrum of interactions and transformations conducive to enhancing the model's predictive power in the downstream task.

2025-09-28 23:23:51,663 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for better predictions, we can combine elements from both given sets and introduce new transformations that may help in capturing important patterns in the data. Let's construct an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f10 ,f14 ,f8 f10 - ,f10 f8 - minmax_scaler ,f8 f10 / minmax_scaler ,f10 f4 f8 - minmax_scaler reciprocal - f12 f4 f8 - minmax_scaler reciprocal - + tanh minmax_scaler sqrt ,f8 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f14 stand_scaler ,f8 sin ,f10 f4 f8 - minmax_scaler reciprocal - f12 f4 f8 - minmax_scaler reciprocal - + tanh minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f14 sin minmax_scaler reciprocal ,f8 reciprocal ,f10 f8 / log ,f14 quan_trans sqrt ,f8 f14 / log ,f9 quan_trans minmax_scaler ,f10 f8 / minmax_scaler reciprocal quan_trans ,f8 sin minmax_scaler reciprocal quan_trans ,f8 f10 - stand_scaler ,f8 f14 / minmax_scaler ,f10 f8 stand_scaler - ,f10 f8 stand_scaler reciprocal ,f8 f14 stand_scaler - ,f14 f8 sin minmax_scaler - ,f14 f10 quan_trans ,f10 f14 - sqrt ,f10 f8 - sqrt quan_trans ,f9 quan_trans sqrt ,f14 f10 / sqrt log]
```

Let's go over some of the transformations used:
- We retain the original features `f10` and `f14` as they appeared in both sets, suggesting they hold importance.
- We add and subtract combinations of `f8`, `f10`, and `f14` with operations such as division, min-max scaling, and taking reciprocals to capture non-linear relationships and differences.
- The use of min-max scaling, stand-scaling, and quantile transformations helps in normalizing features to mitigate skewness and scale variability.
- The `tanh`, `sin`, `reciprocal`, and `sqrt` transformations are used to induce non-linearity, which can be beneficial for capturing complex patterns in the data. The logs and squares are used to handle exponential relationships and reduce variability.
- Feature combinations that showed up in transformations with both `minmax_scaler` and `reciprocal` in several operations in the examples are emphasized, showing their importance potentially in capturing inverse relationships or scaling improvements.

This constructed feature set leverages the strengths of both provided examples while introducing new operations that focus on enhancing clarity, scale normalization, and non-linear pattern inclusion to optimize predictability in downstream tasks.

2025-09-28 23:24:02,359 - INFO - llm output = To derive a new and improved feature set from the given examples, we need to combine concepts from both provided sets, taking advantage of transformations, interactions, and scaling while introducing appropriate new transformations for enhanced prediction capability. Here’s a new feature set that incorporates a blend of the operations:

```
[f1 f2 * , f8 f14 + minmax_scaler , f10 f8 - stand_scaler f14 * , f2 f0 / sqrt , f13 f8 - stand_scaler f10 f8 - stand_scaler + reciprocal , f14 f8 + sig , f8 f10 f8 - stand_scaler f1 + exp , f12 f8 - stand_scaler f7 + cube , f8 f14 + log , f3 f4 stand_scaler + , f6 f9 sigmoid + , f0 f2 / f10 * , f8 f10 f7 * f14 +]
```

Explanation:
- The new set utilizes a variety of transformations, including `minmax_scaler`, `reciprocal`, `exp`, `sigmoid`, `log`, and `cube`, which can help model potential non-linear relationships in the data.
- Encompasses operations that transform and interact with the original features, potentially capturing more complex patterns and gaining additional insights.
- The inclusion of interactions and diverse transformations aids in enhancing the model’s capability to generalize.

2025-09-28 23:24:13,511 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, the second feature set presents a more refined use of feature transformations, involving combinations of min-max scaling, reciprocal, and various other transformation techniques applied strategically across multiple features. To improve upon these, we can integrate more diverse transformations and possibly new operations or interactions that might help to capture non-linear relationships or other hidden patterns in the data.

Here's a new feature set inspired by the examples provided:

```

(f10 f4 f8 -) minmax_scaler reciprocal cube - f12 f4 f8 - minmax_scaler reciprocal cube - + tanh minmax_scaler reciprocal cube]
```

Key modifications include further transformations such as `cube`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `sigmoid` on various original features and combinations. These transformations are chosen to capture non-linear relationships and scale-sensitive interactions that may serve as important predictors for the downstream task. Adjustments are made to apply transformations both directly and in combination, improving chances to uncover complex decision boundaries.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

```
[f8, f10, f4 f8 - f9 /, f4 f8 - f10 /, f3 f14 - quan_trans sqrt, f10 cos, f8 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f8 f10 /, f4 f10 - f9 /, f10 cos sqrt, f10 tanh, f1 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal, f3 f14 - f9 / tanh, f3 f8 - tanh, f14 tanh, f8 quan_trans sqrt, f10 quan_trans sqrt, f9 quan_trans sqrt, f3 f10 - quan_trans sqrt, f0 stand_scaler, f1 f4 - stand_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f1 f5 - tanh, f2 tanh]
```

Explanation:
- We retain some of the original features from both sets that could hold important information (e.g., `f8` and `f10` are repeatedly used, indicating their potential importance).
- We use operations like `cos`, `tanh`, `quan_trans`, and `sqrt` to capture non-linear relationships and adjust distributions.
- Combinations like `f4 f8 - f9 /` and ratios such as `f8 f10 /` attempt to capture interactions and relative differences between features.
- We incorporate both standard scaling and min-max scaling to maintain consistent feature magnitudes and explore their effects on specific combinations.
- Reciprocal transformations are included to manage any skew in distributions.

```

Here is the rationale for the new features included:

- **f10 f1 f2 * / sqrt**: This combines CreditScore, Age, and Debt in a more complex interaction which might capture non-linear relationships influencing credit card approval.
- **f2 log**: Applying a logarithm transformation to Debt can help normalize the distribution if it's skewed.
- **f9 sigmoid**: Using the sigmoid function on Employed can map this feature to a range between 0 and 1, which might be useful if predicting probabilities.
- **f14 reciprocal**: Taking the reciprocal of Income, especially if there's a high variation, can stabilize the potential outliers in income data, providing a different perspective in the feature space.

```

Here are some enhancements introduced in the new feature set:
- Added `f1 f10 / log`: A logarithmic transformation of the ratio of features `f1` and `f10`, which may normalize and stabilize the variance of skewed data.
- Added `f3 f4 * sqrt`: Square root transformation on the product of features `f3` and `f4`, which can help reduce skewness.
- Added `f13 f2 / stand_scaler`: Standard scaling of the ratio of features `f13` and `f2` to center the data around zero with a standard deviation of one.
- Added `f6 f9 + tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent transformation of the sum of `f6` and `f9`, often beneficial when dealing with elements that can take on positive and negative values.
- Added `f7 f8 * / cos`: Cosine transformation of the product of features `f7` and `f8`, which might capture periodic relationships.

These transformations are selected with the aim of enhancing the predictive capabilities of the feature set by introducing non-linear transformations and combinations that capture different relationships among the features.

2025-09-28 23:24:36,203 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, I will generate a new feature set that combines techniques from both examples to create potentially more useful features for the prediction task.

The two feature sets provided leverage some transformation techniques, such as scaling, trigonometric transformations, and reciprocal transformations. I'll craft a new one incorporating a mixture of those along with some arithmetic operations to improve prediction capability.

Here's the new feature set:

```

Here's an attempt to create a more comprehensive feature set:

```

In this feature set:
- The use of `minmax_scaler` combined with `reciprocal` and other arithmetic operations aims at normalizing distributions and enhancing non-linearity, which might be beneficial for some machine learning models.
- Applying `tanh`, `sin`, `cos`, and `sqrt` transformations could introduce non-linearities to capture potential complex patterns within features.
- Operations like `f10 f14 -` evaluate differences which could hint at relationships or discrepancies between similar scaled features.
- Combinations such as `f3 f3 + reciprocal` and `f4 f8 - minmax_scaler reciprocal f5 -` adjust and mix features to create potentially useful interactions and differentiated standing within the dataset.

This feature set attempts to strike a balance between complex transformations and operational interpretations based on the previous two feature sets provided, leveraging potentially useful aspects while reducing redundancy.

2025-09-28 23:24:52,299 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, let's try to create an improved third set by combining elements from both and adding transformations that can capture non-linear relationships or scale features in a useful way for downstream tasks.

Here's a potential feature set combining elements and transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f8 f8 * ,f3 f4 + sigmoid ,f0 f3 sqrt / ,f0 f4 sqrt / ,f0 sqrt ,f1 tanh ,f10 f4 / minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f0 square]
```

Explanation:

1. Reused original features `f0` to `f14` as a baseline.
2. Kept the squared version of `f8` to capture potential nonlinear relationships.
3. Combined `f3` and `f4` through addition and applied the `sigmoid` function, which could help in normalizing and capturing softer thresholds.
4. Created reciprocal square root relationships `f0 f3 sqrt /` and `f0 f4 sqrt /` to understand interactions with these transformations.
5. Added the square root of `f0`, which is a common technique to reduce skewness in features.
6. Included `tanh` transformation on `f1` to provide another nonlinear scaling.
7. Combined a scaling followed by quantile transformation for `f10 f4 /` to capture potential outliers or nonlinear patterns.
8. Retained the square of `f0` to capture its nonlinear interaction. 

This set aims to capture richer patterns and interactions that could potentially improve prediction quality for the credit card application success task.

We may want to include operations that capture relevant interactions and non-linearities present in the data. Here's a proposal:

```plaintext

```

Here are some features explained:
- `f8 f1 * f5 -` creates a complex interaction involving employment history and banking for potential insights on economic stability.
- `f12 f10 + log` leverages numerical transformations (logarithm) on citizenship and credit-related features, which might highlight discrepancies in credit use among citizenship types.
- `f0 f9 + sqrt` captures non-linear patterns in gender and employment, factoring into chances for credit approval.
- `f13 f2 * minmax_scaler` scales income-related data (often quite varied) in conjunction with age, which shows maturity-spending patterns.
- `f14 f6 - tanh` uses ethnic differences with a hyperbolic function to handle outliers or create a smoother gradient for modeling.

These features are engineered to potentially capture important interactions, non-linear trends, and variability in data, thus offering a more enriched space for downstream predictive modeling.

- Non-linear transformations such as cube and square to capture potential complex relationships.
- Scaled and normalized features to maintain consistency and allow models to capture patterns more effectively.
- Feature interaction terms which consider differences and ratios that could enhance the feature space.
- Application of quantile transformations and normalizations to manage skewness and outliers in data distributions.

### Explanation
- I've included base features from the previous examples as they are already transformed combinations.
- Introduced diverse mathematical operations such as `log`, `sqrt`, and combinations of features like `f8 f10 + log`, which captures potentially useful interactions and non-linearity.
- Added `f3 f12 * sqrt` to explore interactions between different features employing `sqrt` for non-linear scaling.
- Retained features that involve `cos` and `sin` functions to capture periodic patterns and oscillations which might be present.

This set aims to be comprehensive while introducing potentially useful transformations that might improve model performance in predicting successful credit card applications.

In this set, I've added two new transformations:
1. `f9 f10 f14 - sqrt +` - This incorporates a potential new interaction between `f9`, `f10`, and `f14`, where the difference between `f10` and `f14` is scaled using the square root and then combined with `f9`.
2. `f9 reciprocal f14 - sigmoide` - This calculates the difference between `f9`'s reciprocal and `f14`, followed by applying a sigmoid function to squash the resulting values into the (0,1) range, potentially capturing non-linear interactions.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Inclusion of Basic Features**: The set includes basic features `f0` through `f14` to ensure that the original information is preserved.

2. **Selected Transformations from Given Sets**: 
   - Borrowed transformations like `f0 f8 *`, `f3 sigmoid`, `f4 sigmoid`, `f3 square`, `f4 square` for capturing interactions and non-linear relationships.
   - Included scaled features like `f10 f3 / minmax_scaler`, `f10 f4 / minmax_scaler`, `f0 quan_trans`, etc., from the given sets.

3. **New Transformations**: Introduced new feature interactions and transformations:
   - `f2 f3 +` captures additive interactions.
   - `f6 f7 - sin` applies a trigonometric transformation on differences.
   - `f1 f2 f10 * *` involves multiplication for complex interactions.
   - `f5 f14 / log` captures multiplicative and logarithmic transformations to address different scales.

This newly designed feature set strives to balance between leveraging existing transformations and introducing new ones to potentially enhance predictive performance.

In this version, existing features are retained while two additional transformations add variability and potential predictive power:
- `f4 f8 / log`: Uses logarithm scaling on division of two features, capturing interaction terms potentially useful for prediction.
- `f1 f14 tanh`: Applies hyperbolic tangent on interaction of two features, potentially unearthing non-linear relationships.
- `f2 f3 * sigmoide`: Applies the sigmoid function after multiplying two features, allowing for capturing interaction effects in a normalizing manner.

These new features, combined with complex transformations, may capture data patterns pertinent to the task.

- Including product terms such as `f0 f1 *`, `f0 f2 *`, etc., as interaction features may reveal complex relationships.
- Transformations are applied consistently across interactions, enhancing model expressiveness.

In this feature set, I've incorporated: 

- Basic feature interactions and scaling without linear transformations preserved.
- A variety of non-linear transformations including `sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `cube`.
- Emphasis on interactions between features by combining existing features in additive (`+`), subtractive (`-`), multiplicative (`*`), and divisive (`/`) manners.
- A careful balance between feature interactions and transformations aims to capture potential non-linear relationships.
- Re-use of scaling methods (`stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`) to standardize feature interaction results, which could enhance the model's ability to generalize on new data.

By expanding beyond linear combinations and introducing diverse transformations, we can potentially uncover hidden patterns relevant to predicting credit card application success.

Below is a more refined set:

In this improved set:
- I have introduced `f11 f10 / log`, which combines features 11 and 10 through division and logarithmic transformation might reveal multiplicative patterns.
- I incorporated `f11 log tanh`, using a combination of logarithmic and hyperbolic tangent transformations on feature 11, to pick up on non-linear relationships.
- Maintained most complex synergy combinations, extracting latent information across diverse feature interactions for a robust predictive task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:26:13,273 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and their transformations, a better feature set should aim to enrich the data representation and potentially improve the model's ability to learn complex patterns while avoiding redundancy or unnecessary complexity. Merging the ideas from both given feature sets, I'll propose a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f3 cube, f4 cube, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f3 f0 -, f4 f0 -, f1 square, f2 square, f5 square, f6 square, f7 square, f8 square, f9 square, f10 square, f11 square, f12 square, f13 square, f14 square, f0 reciprocal, f0 cube, f1 f2 *, f1 f3 *]
```

Here are the considerations taken in this new feature set:

1. Maintain the diversity of transformations both from original and newly generated features to keep a range of potential inputs to the predictive model.
2. Include the cube and minmax_scaler transformations on existing features for potential nonlinear relationships and scaling benefits.
3. Include all the square transformations for testing interactions, favoring complexities that could arise from squaring continuous or categorical values.
4. Combine some existing factors using multiplication (e.g., `f1 f2 *`, `f1 f3 *`) to create interaction terms, capturing relationships between features that might be influencing the target outcome.
5. Leave out overly complex or potentially redundant transformations (like double usage of reciprocal or cube repeatedly) that may not appreciably increase predictive power without adding extra complexity.

2025-09-28 23:26:18,083 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples and the potential to improve predictions, let's design a new feature set by considering the transformation operations and their effects on feature distributions and relationships:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14,

 f1 f0 / cos, 
 f2 f3 * sin,

 f6 f7 * sqrt ]
```

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Feature Interactions & Transformations**:
   - Interaction terms (like `f3 f4 + minmax_scaler`) capture relationships that can be predictive of credit card application success.
   - Nonlinear transformations, such as `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `log`, can help in normalizing skewed feature distributions.
   
2. **Scaling and Normalization**:
   - Using `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` ensures that features are normalized, which is crucial for models sensitive to feature scales, such as those using distance metrics.

3. **Higher-Order Terms and Exponentiation**:
   - Squaring and taking square roots (e.g., `f8 f8 * sqrt`) can introduce polynomial relationships, capturing more complex dependencies.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Employing `quan_trans` can help reduce the dimensionality of categorical features while maintaining informative variance.

This feature set cautiously combines foundational features with their transformations, leading to a comprehensive and potentially more predictive feature matrix.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this improved feature set:
- Removed the feature with repeated transformations `f4 f8 - minmax_scaler reciprocal f4 cube reciprocal -` as it was less informative.
- Consolidated features using cosine transformations that provide non-linear characteristics which might capture intricate patterns better. 
- Retained other transformations that offer various perspectives on the data distribution and relationships (e.g., reciprocal, minmax_scaler).
- Ensured all remaining features can potentially contribute to revealing patterns in the data related to predicting credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-28 23:26:38,332 - INFO - llm output = To improve on the provided feature sets with transformations aimed at generating meaningful features for predicting credit card application success, we can carefully craft a third set. 

In this third set, I'll include features that were common in both previous sets, particularly those involving complex transformations such as min-max scaling and quantile transformation, as well as operations that produce interaction terms and non-linear transformations. Additionally, I will introduce some advanced feature interactions that can capture non-linear patterns more effectively:

```plaintext
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, 
 f10 f3 / minmax_scaler, f10 f4 / minmax_scaler, f0 quan_trans, f0 minmax_scaler, 
 f0 square, f0 cube, f0 log, 
 f1 f0 *, f2 f0 *, f3 f0 *, f4 f0 *, f5 f0 *, f6 f0 *, f7 f0 *, f8 f0 *, f9 f0 *, 
 f10 f0 *, f11 f0 *, f12 f0 *, f13 f0 *, f14 f0 *, 
 f0 f1 *, f0 f1 /, f0 f5 /, f0 tanh, f0 sqrt]
```

Explanation of the new features included:
1. `f3 f0 *`, `f4 f0 *`: Interaction terms that capture relationships between features that were not in one of the prior sets.
2. `f0 log`: Log transformation can often help in handling skewed distributions, which is common in financial features like income or credit score.
3. `f0 tanh`, `f0 sqrt`: Non-linear transformations that could capture non-linear relationships.
4. `f0 f1 /`: Additional interaction feature that might capture a specific ratio, potentially helping to understand relationships like income-to-debt.

This set aims to retain useful transformations from the previous examples while adding potentially informative non-linear features and interaction terms, thereby better capturing the intricacies of the prediction task.

1. Incorporate the use of `tanh` and `minmax_scaler` transformations as they can help in normalizing data.
2. Include subtraction operations as they might reveal relationships between features.
3. Consider reciprocal transformations to handle scaling of certain features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

A combined feature set could look like this:

```

This feature set includes elements from both provided examples and adds additional potential interactions and transformations. Here are some of the additions explained:
- `f0 f3 /` and `f0 f4 /` from the first set to capture the ratios that might highlight relationships between those features.
- `f1 f2 +` is an addition of two features which might capture some linear combination effect.
- `f6 f7 -` is a subtraction that could represent a difference in years employed and prior defaults.
- `f5 f9 *` multiplies Industry code and Employed status, possibly capturing industry-specific employment effects.
- `f10 f11 /` divides the driver’s license status by the citizenship status (encoded), which could provide insights into legal ability correlating to credit applications.

```

In this feature set, I've taken into account that both provided examples were identical, indicating these features are already well-formulated. To make an improvement, I've added two additional features:

1. `f9 f8 sqrt /`: This combines `f9` and `f8` by taking the square root of `f8` and dividing `f9` by this result, potentially capturing interaction effects between these variables.
2. `f12 f14 * tanh`: This feature multiplies `f12` and `f14` and then applies the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh), which might help in capturing complex relationships.
