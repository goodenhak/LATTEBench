The goal is to produce a transformed feature set that is more concise while incorporating useful transformations. We'll focus on incorporating feature interactions and varied transformations to capture non-linear relationships.

```

**Explanation:**
1. Combined interactions between `f4 cube stand_scaler` and `f3`, promoting correlations between sons' occupation counts and the two-class classification.
2. Included nested transformations (`sqrt` and `cube`) to capture complex patterns effectively.
3. Optimized the use of operations and redundancy by minimizing repetitive operations while maintaining comprehensiveness.

This transformed feature set better balances complexity and conciseness and leverages both linear and non-linear transformations for prediction.

1. **Square Root and Log**: Helps in normalizing data and reducing skewness.
   
2. **Tanh**: Introduces non-linearity, suitable for capturing intricate patterns.

3. **Combination of arithmetic operations**: Allows interaction between features which might possess underlying combinatorial significance.

4. **Cube and Reciprocal**: Powerful when combined to handle extreme changes in magnitude and relationships.

5. **Standard Scaling and Min-Max Scaling**: Ensures features contribute equally to predictions and improved interpretations.

6. **Quantile Transformation**: Maps feature to follow a normal distribution, which might improve model performance particularly for Gaussian-based models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

1. Starting with combinations of base features using operations like sum and multiplication for potential interaction.
2. Introducing conditional complexity by involving operations like square, sqrt, tanh, log, reciprocal, and cube to capture non-linear relationships.
3. Expanding upon feature interactions by adding transformation operations that can help reveal hidden patterns and maximize feature variance.
4. Utilizing transformations like `sigmoid`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and `cube` alongside existing operations to enhance model-dependent separability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

```

**Explanation:**
- We have maintained complex combinations of the features `f2` and `f4` with arithmetic operations and have introduced additional transformations like `cube`, `log`, `tanh`, and `stand_scaler` to extract more nuanced features.
- These transformations can help capture non-linear relationships in the data and ensure the modeled relationships are robust across different scales of data.
- Function `tanh` helps keep the outputs bounded, useful for dealing with extreme values.
- Standard scaling ensures the features are on a similar scale, which helps models converge faster and perform better.

Based on the given sets, the transformation involves a combination of arithmetic operations and functional transformations on the features.

Let's analyze the components consistently featured in both sets:

1. The use of `f4`, which seems to be pivotal as it's involved in several transformations, often squared and subtracted.
2. Calculations involving `f2` and `f3`, often in combinations where they are subtracted or squared, hinting at their importance in relationship with `f4`.
3. The application of functions like `square`, `sigmoid`, and other arithmetic operations.

Taking cues and improving on these, a more informative feature set could be:

```plaintext

```

Explanation of changes:
- Introduced more complex transformations like cube, logarithm, reciprocal, square root, and trigonometric functions to capture non-linear relationships.
- Retained frequently used operations (such as square and subtraction) for foundational importance among features.
- Added diversity in transformations that were successful in previous examples, including sigmoid and tanh, which help in feature compression and capturing nuances especially around distribution shapes.

This new set aims to encapsulate potential non-linear relationships and interactions between features that were suggested by previous patterns and observations, thus enhancing the predictive quality for the target classification task.

- We used `reciprocal` and `sqrt` for non-linear transformation aiming to capture inverse and root relationships.
- The combination of `minmax_scaler` followed by `sigmoid` focuses on ensuring the data is re-scaled and exploits the non-linearity of sigmoid, potentially capturing subtle patterns.

Let's consider using combinations of transformations provided in the examples. We will favor transformations that could offer a deeper insight or distinct transformation:

1. **Square and Standard Scaler**: This combination is useful for normalizing transformed data to have zero mean and unit variance, which is beneficial when the feature has multi-modal distribution.
   
2. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Often used to address skewness by compressing large values and expanding small values, which can be insightful if the original feature is skewed.

3. **Quantile Transformation and Cosine**: The quantile transformation is useful to make the feature distribution more Gaussian-like, while cosine can help in capturing cyclical patterns.

New feature set based on the examples:

\[ 
[ 
f4 stand_scaler, 
f4 quantile_transform cos, 
f4 reciprocal f1 f4 - - cos, 
f4 reciprocal f1 f4 - - f3 f4 - f4 - - cos,

Explanation of the proposed feature set:
1. Involves complex combinations of existing operations to potentially uncover non-linear relationships.
2. Uses `sqrt`, `log`, and `reciprocal` to handle non-linear transformations, which can be beneficial in classification tasks by normalizing skewness and handling large variations.
3. Introduces combinations with `f3 f3 +` to incorporate more interaction terms with a potentially important feature.

Here's the newly proposed feature set:

```
[f2, f3, f4, f4 square, f3 f4 + f3 f4 + f4 + *, f4 sqrt f3 f4 + f4 + *,

 f3 f2 +, f0 f1 *, f1 reciprocal, f2 f3 *, f4 tanh, f3 f4 * cube]
```

In this feature set:
- I retained original features `f2`, `f3`, `f4` and common transformations from both sets like `f4 square`, `f0 f3 +`, `f1 square`, `f2 sigmoid`, and `f3 sigmoid`.
- Complex expressions such as `f3 f4 + f3 f4 + f4 + *`, and `f4 sqrt f3 f4 + f4 + *` are kept, as they provide deeper interaction terms.
- I introduced new features: 
  - `f0 f1 *` to capture interaction between fathers' and sons' occupations.
  - `f1 reciprocal` to explore the inverse effect of sons' occupation. 
  - `f2 f3 *` to explore interaction between family structure and race.
  - `f4 tanh` for a non-linear transformation of the target feature, which can capture saturation effects.
  - `f3 f4 * cube` to explore third-order interactions between race and the target feature. 

These transformations are aimed at providing diverse perspectives on the data to assist the model in capturing underlying patterns more effectively.

The latter example suggests incorporating transformations like `sigmoid`, which is good for normalizing values between 0 and 1. Let's use this concept and push for broader transformations and combinations:

**New Feature Set:**
```
[f4 square f2 f3 - - f4 f3 - cube - , f4 f3 - f4 tanh f2 f3 - - - f4 f2 f3 - - f4 f3 - - - , f4 f2 f3 - log f4 f3 - reciprocal - - , f4 f3 - f4 tanh f2 f3 - sqrt - - - f4 f2 f3 - - f4 f3 - - , f4 f2 f3 - log f4 f3 - reciprocal minmax_scaler - - , f4 f3 - f4 tanh square f2 f3 - log - - - ]
```

In this new set:
- I've retained the spirit of complexity by mixing arithmetic operations with transformations.
- I've added `cube`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `reciprocal` to introduce more non-linearity.
- I've used `tanh` and `minmax_scaler` to help normalize and stabilize the feature scales.
- The feature combinations aim to capture potentially richer interactions between the original features.

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Features**: Keep the original features `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` to preserve the core data values.
   
2. **Transformed Features**:
   - Use subtractions (`f2 f4 -` and `f4 f3 -`) to capture differences between features, highlighting potentially influential variances.
   - Employ squared differences (`f4 square f2 f3 - -`) when applicable to account for non-linear separations.
   - Combine multiple transformations to get composite features like `f4 square f2 f3 - - f4 f2 f3 - f3 -`.

2025-10-22 01:00:30,360 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, we need to construct a new feature set using postfix expression transformations that are better than the first two sets. The goal is to generate features that capture meaningful information for the downstream prediction task while utilizing the transformations and operations provided.

Here is a new feature set combining ideas from both examples, focusing on creating non-linear transformations and feature interactions that could potentially capture more complex relationships:

```
[f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f3 f4 + f3 f4 + f4 + * ,f4 sqrt f3 f4 + f4 + * ,f1 f2 * f3 f4 + f4 + * ,f1 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 f4 / ,f4 cube ,f3 log ,f2 tanh]
```

This new set includes:

1. **Direct Features**: Retain some original features like `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` for preserving baseline information.
2. **Polynomials and Interactions**: The feature `f3 f4 + f3 f4 + f4 + *` captures interactions in a complex way. Similarly, the interaction `f1 f2 * f3 f4 + f4 + *` takes advantage of potential relationships between `f1`, `f2`, and nonlinear components.
3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Incorporate square, square root, logarithm, and cube which might help in capturing non-linear relationships: `f1 square`, `f3 sqrt`, `f4 cube`, `f3 log`.
4. **Fraction and Ratios**: The ratio `f3 f4 /` might highlight relative scales between `f3` and `f4`.
5. **Sigmoid and Hyperbolic Transformations**: Utilize `tanh` with `f2` which could help to model saturation effects and scale non-linearly.

The transformations aim to extract various patterns by employing non-linear operations and interactions. Adjustments and experimentation based on model performance and interpretability would help refine and confirm the effectiveness of these generated features.

2025-10-22 01:00:45,673 - INFO - llm output = To improve the predictions for the given dataset and task, it's important to leverage feature transformations that capture underlying patterns in the data. Based on the examples provided, I'll suggest a feature set using postfix expressions that could be potentially useful for improving the classification task.

Taking into account the operations and transformations shown in both examples, the aim should be to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features, considering scaling and normalization techniques to handle numerical stability.

Here is a refined feature set:

```plaintext
[f4 ,f4 quan_trans ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 tanh f0 f1 + f2 f4 - + cos ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f1 tanh f2 cos + ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 reciprocal ,f4 stand_scaler f1 * f3 stand_scaler + tanh ,f4 quan_trans f3 cube + f1 * ,f2 sin ,f4 cos]
```

Explanation:
- Applied `quan_trans` and `minmax_scaler` on `f4`, the target feature, for normalization and transformation to handle outliers and variance.
- Used `sqrt` on `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to normalize and smoothen the values in these categorical features, utilizing ordinal encoding could be beneficial.
- Combined `f0`, `f4`, `f1`, and `f3` with trigonometric transformations like `cos` and `tanh` which may capture non-linear relationships.
- Performed concatenation of transformations and basic operations (+, *, -) on features to create interaction terms that could encapsulate complex relationships.
- Finally, utilized `stand_scaler`, `reciprocal`, and `cube` transformations ensuring data is evenly distributed, reducing skewness and capturing polynomial relationships.

These transformations can help in learning complex patterns and improving the model's ability to differentiate between target classes 'P' and 'N', especially in capturing interactions that are not apparent through simple linear models.

2025-10-22 01:00:55,642 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we can aim to incorporate feature transformations that might capture non-linearities or interactions in the data. Given the operations and the examples, let's propose a new feature set by combining and modifying some of the transformations:

- Start by incorporating combinations from the second example, as suggested it has better transformations.
- Utilize transformations like `sigmoid` and `minmax_scaler` which can scale and normalize data potentially making it better suited for prediction tasks.
- Use the `quan_trans` for robustness against outliers.
- Since we can use postfix notation, let's also benefit from creating interaction terms manually.

Here's a proposed feature set that could potentially improve the model:

```
[f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f4 quan_trans sigmoid sigmoid ,f3 f4 / sigmoid ,f2 f3 * minmax_scaler ,f4 f3 - f2 + sigmoid ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 quan_trans ,f1 f4 * tanh f3 - ]
```

The transformations:
- Interactions between `f2`, `f3` and `f4` using basic arithmetic operations for added depth (like dividing, multiplying, adding).
- Usage of `sigmoid` and `minmax_scaler` to ensure scaling for non-linear relationship consideration.
- Integration of `quan_trans` which is robust to outliers like those in a dataset with a high standard deviation.
- A `tanh` transformation after multiplication to potentially capture non-linear interactions.
