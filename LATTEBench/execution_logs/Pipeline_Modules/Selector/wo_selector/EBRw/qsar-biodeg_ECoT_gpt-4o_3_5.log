2025-09-28 23:47:22,044 - INFO - llm output = In designing a better feature set for improving predictions, when considering transformations and various feature interactions, it is essential to utilize a mix of nonlinear transformations, scaling, and cross-feature combinations that can capture more complex relationships. Here's an improved feature set inspired by the given examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 minmax_scaler ,f26 minmax_scaler ,f35 minmax_scaler ,f1 f35 * ,f0 f26 * ,f2 f35 / ,f3 f26 / ,f4 f26 * ,f5 f26 * ,f8 f35 * ,f9 f26 * ,f9 f35 * ,f14 f26 / ,f14 f35 * ,f15 f26 log ,f20 f35 log ,f21 f35 *, f25 f26 *, f3 f21 * quan_trans ,f9 f21 * quan_trans ,f10 f35 reciprocal ,f15 f26 reciprocal ,f3 f26 sqrt ,f8 f26 sqrt ,f14 f0 ,f18 f35 sqrt ,f20 f26 cube ,f3 f35 cube ,f23 f26 cube ,f15 f35 sqrt ,f17 f35 sqrt ,f18 f26 tanh ,f19 f21 * sqrt]
```

### Explanation:
- **Scaling Improvements**: Applying `minmax_scaler` to frequently used features (f21, f26, f35) to handle direct scaling across several sub-transformations, which could normalize their impact across the dataset.
- **Cross-feature combinations**: Introducing products and divisions like `f1 f35 *`, `f0 f26 *`, and other combinations to explore interaction terms that exponentialize the power of features when combined.
- **Nonlinear transformations**: Utilization of operations such as `log`, `reciprocal`, `sqrt`, and `cube` to capture non-linear relationships that a linear model might miss.
- **Quantile Transformation**: The use of `quan_trans` on multiplications to scale them into a uniform distribution.
- **Targeted transformations**: Focusing additional transformations like `tanh`, `sqrt`, and `cube` on selected interactions to capture potential nonlinear relationships in a different mathematical space.

This optimized feature set aims to create a broader range of transformed and interacted variables that can enhance prediction by querying other layers of relationships. It's designed to be more complex and informative, which could help machine learning models to learn more nuanced distinctions between the "ready" and "not-ready" biodegradable chemicals.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:47:30,768 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided and considering the management of complexity while preserving predictive capability, we can create a new set of features. This feature set will leverage operations such as scaling, transformations, and interactions that may capture non-linear relationships and interactions more effectively.

Here's a suggested feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f21 ,f35 ,f0 f14 + f0 f12 f21 + + + ,f1 f25 * f30 + reciprocal ,f0 sqrt ,f26 sqrt ,f1 f2 * ,f3 f38 reciprocal * ,f4 f21 f21 * sqrt * ,f5 f13 sin * ,f6 f7 * minmax_scaler ,f8 f12 * reciprocal ,f9 f21 cube ,f10 f15 * ,f11 f33 * sin ,f13 f38 * sigmoid ,f14 f40 * tanh ,f16 f21 * cube ,f17 f27 * minmax_scaler ,f18 f38 reciprocal ,f20 f21 cube ,f22 f35 * sigmoid ,f23 f40 f38 * sigmoid * ,f24 f38 sqrt ,f25 f35 sqrt ,f26 square ,f30 f38 reciprocal ,f32 f21 * tanh ,f33 f38 * sigmoid ,f35 f38 * cube ,f36 f17 * log ,f40 f21 * tanh ,f0 f21 * sin ,f25 f38 * cube ,f26 sin f35 sqrt * sigmoid ,f9 f27 tanh ,f32 cube ,f14 f26 * ,f26 f38 * reciprocal ,f0 stand_scaler ,f22 f35 * minmax_scaler ,f23 f21 * sigmoid ,f24 f38 * cube ,f0 tanh ]
```

This feature set tries to balance the use of fundamental mathematical operations and transformation functions, which potentially captures more diverse patterns. It integrates scaling and non-linear transformations to enhance or moderate the monotonic transformations performed on the chemical descriptors. 

By carefully adding element-wise operations, interactions, and advanced functions like reciprocal, cube, tanh, and sigmoid, this feature set aims to retain useful variability and interactions needed for modeling tasks, while managing dimensionality and ensuring numerical stability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:
1. **Logarithmic, Cube, and Square Combinations:**
   - Applying `log`, `cube`, and `square` transformations often help in capturing nonlinear relationships and can also help in dealing with skewness in the data.

2. **Interactions with Quantile Transformation:**
   - Using `quan_trans` in combination with differences or sums of features can potentially bring nonlinearity to relationships within features and help with skewed distributions by normalizing them.

3. **Use of Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions:**
   - Including `sin`, `cos`, and `tanh` can help capture periodic or oscillatory patterns in the data which might not be evident otherwise.

4. **Standard Scaling and Min-Max Scaling:**
   - Applying scaling transformations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` helps in ensuring that features are on a similar scale, which is especially useful for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

5. **Nonlinear Interactions:**
   - Exploring combinations of multiplication and division across features with each transformation helps in capturing the interactions between different magnitudes of features.

By using a variety of mathematical transformations and combinations, you can potentially reveal hidden patterns or relationships in the data that facilitate the classification task. This feature set emphasizes robustness and diversity in transformation techniques.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this new set, I have applied additional operations such as logarithm (`log`), hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`), multiplication (`*`), and reciprocal transformation (`reciprocal`) to some features to potentially capture more interaction terms and non-linear relationships, which can improve model predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f4, f6, f7, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f16, f17, f21, f22, f24, f25, f26, f27, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f40,

 f34 sin, f20 cos, 
 f7 stand_scaler sqrt, f10 tanh, f37 log]
```

### Explanation of Choices:
1. **Preservation of Useful Operations**: Retained scaling/transforming techniques such as `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `sigmoid` that appeared promising in the two previous feature sets.
2. **Enhancement with More Transforms**:
   - Introduced `sqrt` for the standardized `f7` to capture nonlinear dynamics.
   - Applied `tanh` to `f10` to leverage potential non-linearity suppression in that feature.
   - Used `log` transformation on `f37` as this might normalize skewed distributions.
   - Added `cos` for `f20` to diversify the transformation approaches used and explore additional feature interactions that may benefit the predictive task.
3. **Efficient Combination**:
   - Combined features such as `f0 f13 +`, `f14 f13 +`, and `f26 f13 +` as they reflect interactions with the common feature `f13`.
   - Kept cube of `f24`, as composites of original features can bring additional value, especially when used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the model with high-dimensional polynomials.
4. **Removed Redundancies**: Ensured there was diversity in feature transformations to minimize redundancy across the feature space while maintaining computational efficiency.

This new feature set aims to capture both simple and complex interactions in the data that could be predictive of the binary classification task, while keeping the operations interpretable and computationally feasible.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:48:05,515 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature transformations provided in the two examples, a "better" feature set should offer a combination that enhances the predictive power for the downstream task by capturing interactions and non-linearities, and also providing concise yet informative transformations. Let's construct a new feature set considering these aspects:

```text
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f29, f30, f32, f33, f35, f36, f37, f38, f40, f1 sigmoid, f2 sigmoid, f4 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f15 sigmoid, f16 sigmoid, f17 sigmoid, f20 sigmoid, f22 sigmoid, f29 sigmoid, f30 sigmoid, f31 sigmoid, f32 sigmoid, f33 sigmoid, f35 sigmoid, f36 sigmoid, f37 sigmoid, f39 sigmoid, f40 sigmoid, f0 f34 - ,f7 f34 - ,f14 f34 - ,f26 f34 - ,f11 f11 + ,f21 cube, f26 cube, f35 cube, f38 cube, f29 cos cube, f35 cos cube, f6 f13 * cube, f15 f13 * cube, f2 f0 + cube, f24 square, f13 reciprocal, f24 quan_trans, f24 f24 +, f24 minmax_scaler, f11 reciprocal, f12 reciprocal, f22 reciprocal, f28 reciprocal, f40 reciprocal]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Selection**: The new set includes mostly all base features (`f0, f1, f2, ..., f40`) to capture the broad spectrum of descriptors.
2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Applied non-linear transformations (`sigmoid`, `cube`, `cos cube`, `square`) to a diverse range of features. These help to model potential non-linear relationships without making unnecessary assumptions about the data distribution.
3. **Feature Interactions**: Combined select pairs of features with basic arithmetic operations (+ and *) to capture interactions, recognizing that complex patterns may arise from combinations of features, not just their individual contributions.
4. **Scaling and Normalization**: Using scaling functions like `sigmoid`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans` to maintain numerical stability, especially during non-linear transformations.
5. **Consistency and Brevity**: The updated set avoids redundancy by ensuring unique transformation combinations, eliminating straightforward repetitions.

By mixing and matching these transformations, the goal is to achieve a robust set of features that help emphasize important patterns in the classification problem.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation of Transformations:
1. **Reciprocal and Logarithmic Transformations**: These can highlight multiplicative relationships and scale-down skewed data.
2. **MinMax Scalar and Standard Scaler**: These bring features to a comparable scale, which can be critical for some machine learning algorithms.
3. **Combination of Feature Operations**: Utilize basic arithmetic to combine features in ways that might capture interactions between different molecular descriptors.
4. **Trigonometric Functions** (`sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, etc.): These can help in non-linear transformations and creating non-linear relationships.

### Justification:
- **Diverse Transformations**: Using a broad spectrum of transformations to capture linear and non-linear relationships.
- **Scale Standardization**: Ensuring features are on a similar scale can be critical for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.
- **Interaction Terms and Higher-order Features**: Incorporating terms like cubes and interactions can capture complex dependencies not clear from original features.

This feature set aims to improve the prediction model's capacity to capture complex patterns within the dataset. Adjustments can further refine these after evaluating model performance improvements.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f24 f5 + f21 * ,f24 f5 + f22 * ,f24 f5 + f40 * ,f24 f5 + f7 quan_trans * ,f24 f5 + f24 f15 + *]

2025-09-28 23:48:29,219 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set from the two given examples, we need to ensure we select diverse transformations that could capture different ways the original features might interact to influence the classification outcome. We'll take inspiration from the given examples and propose a new set of feature transformations. 

Here's a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f4, f5, f9, f13, f14, f17, f21, f26, f29, 
 f13 tanh , f4 square , f4 sqrt , f22 sqrt , f36 sqrt , f22 sqrt sin ,

 f7 f14 + sqrt , f0 f5 + f32 * , f17 f26 + sqrt , 
 f29 f21 + , f4 f22 + ]
```

- Selected a combination of original features and ones from the example.
- Applied transformations: `tanh`, `sqrt`, `cos`, `sin`, `square`, and `stand_scaler`, to a mix of features that were chosen in the given examples and others, to keep diversity.
- Included pair-wise operations to capture potential interactions, using both additions and multiplication for variety.
- Applied transformations on the results of pair-wise operations to add non-linearity and depth to the feature representation.

The focus was on varying both the features involved and the transformations applied while maintaining a balance among different types of operations and features. This diversity could help uncover nonlinear relationships and interactions that improve classification performance in the biodegradation task.

### Explanation:

1. **Retain All Original Features**: Both feature sets include the original features (though one skips f3 and f18, we are keeping them as they might contain valuable information).

2. **Select Transformations Based on Examples**:
   - Use reciprocal transformation from the first example, which can handle skewness and emphasize small values of variables (e.g., f11 reciprocal, f12 reciprocal, etc.).
   - Integrate cubic transformations for selected indices that seem to hold valuable information (e.g., f1 cube, f4 cube, f13 cube from Example 1; added others from Example 2).

3. **Incorporate Additional Relevant Operations**:
   - To capture potential non-linear relationships in the data, include mathematical and statistical transformations such as `tanh` and `sqrt` for different features based on both provided examples. 

4. **Diverse Transformations**:
   - By integrating both transformation strategies (e.g., reciprocal, tanh, square, cube, sqrt, quan_trans) from the given sets and considering additional reasonable pairings, a wider range of patterns and interactions might be captured.

Remember to further optimize this feature set through experimentation, using techniques such as feature selection or dimensionality reduction, evaluating model performance, and understanding domain-specific knowledge.

In this feature set, I've incorporated elements and transformations from both examples while maintaining a balance between basic operations (like addition) and more specialized transformations (like cos, sin, reciprocal, cube). By utilizing cosine transformations and cubes, we intend to capture potentially nonlinear relationships. The inclusion of transformations like `f24 quan_trans`, standardizations (`minmax_scaler`), and combinations of features (e.g., `f21 f22 cos -`) also seek to enhance the robustness and the predictive power of the new features.

In this feature set, we incorporate a variety of transformations such as trigonometric functions, logarithmic transformations, scaling, and other non-linear transformations on different features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:49:27,876 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the examples provided, let's explore the combination and transformation of existing features. We can build upon the transformations used in the earlier examples and introduce more sophisticated transformations to improve feature representation.

The previous examples applied the `sigmoid` transformation to `f37` and the `tanh` transformation followed by `minmax_scaler` to `f38`. Consider more complex transformations that might capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

Here is a new feature set suggestion:
```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 sigmoid tanh ,f38 stand_scaler sqrt]
```

### Explanation:
- `f37 sigmoid tanh`: This is a nested transformation where `f37` is first passed through the `sigmoid` function and then through the `tanh` function. This could help in capturing more complex non-linear relationships by stacking two common activation functions.

- `f38 stand_scaler sqrt`: Standardize `f38` using `stand_scaler` to have zero mean and unit variance, then apply the `sqrt` transformation to account for potential non-linear effects. The square root transformation can sometimes help stabilize variance.

These transformations aim to explore potential interactions and stabilize variance, helping machine learning models understand intricate patterns within the data more effectively.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here’s a feature set combining the best aspects from the examples:

```

This combines elements from both provided examples:
- Retains the comprehensive set of `tanh` transformations, which can help normalize potentially skewed distributions.
- Includes the reciprocal and quantile transformations for specific features, which can stabilize variance and handle outliers.
- Adds logarithmic transformations for some additional selected features which could be skewed or encompass a large range.
- Incorporates a transformed feature using `minmax_scaler` as inspired by the first example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, I’ve retained the use of the sigmoid transformation as it appeared frequently in the second example, which is deemed better. I also included cosine transformations, combinations via addition and subtraction, and operations like reciprocal and multiplication to capture more complex relationships. Moreover, additional transformations like log and sqrt are included to introduce non-linear relationships that might be beneficial for capturing underlying patterns.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

In this set:
- Some combinations leverage basic arithmetic operations and normalization to reveal interactions between features that are more aligned to the decision boundary.
- Transforms like `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `log` are applied to combinations to increase the dynamic range of the inputs.
- Small constants (e.g., `1e-5`) are added to prevent division-by-zero errors.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Here's a summary of the approach:
- Retained all original features for comprehensive coverage.
- Employed a mix of transformations like scaling (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`), quantile transformation, and activation functions (`sigmoid`, `tanh`) to potentially capture nonlinear relationships.
- Introduced pairwise operations between certain features to explore interactions.
- Applied mathematical transformations (`sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, `cube`, `square`) for feature enrichment.
- Focused on balancing complexity with interpretability by choosing a diverse set of transformations to uncover hidden patterns while avoiding excessive transformations that might lead to overfitting.

When determining the best transformations to include, it's important to account for the diversity and potential benefits these transformations bring in capturing complex relationships in the data.

Here is a refined and potentially better feature set based on the given examples:

```

### Explanation:
- **Retained Transformations:**
  - **Reciprocal:** Applied to specific features where values are non-zero to possibly emphasize smaller scales and interactions.
  - **Cube:** Enlarges feature values to potentially capture interactions with high non-linearity.
  - **Sigmoid:** Smooths highly variable data, transforming them into a similar range.
  - **Tanh:** Protects against outliers by mapping to the range (-1, 1), ideal for centered data.
  - **Quantile Transformation:** Ensures distributional shifts, which can be pivotal when handling imbalanced data.
  - **Log Transformation:** Used for leveled enhancements, effective for skewed distributions.
  - **Min-Max Scaling:** Used as it allows multiplication with another feature for feature interaction analysis.

- **Newly Added Transformations:**
  - **Square Root and Sum (f0 f1 + sqrt):** Captures the potential complex relationship between two features.
  - **Square Root on Multiplication (f9 f19 * sqrt):** Probing interactions between specific features to capture nuanced relationships.

By reviewing the nature of the current set and adding complex Interaction terms, this feature set takes into account a broad, insightful observation towards multi-feature relationships, potentially aiding in capturing latent patterns linked to chemical biodegradability classification.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this improved set, I retained the core feature transformations while integrating new operations that may capture more intricate patterns and relationships, such as the use of `sqrt`, `minmax_scaler`, and `log`. The harmonic relationships and combinations aim to enhance predictive power in the task of classifying chemical compounds into their respective biodegradability classes.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here is the resulting feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40,

```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Set Inclusion**: This set includes all the original features (`f0` to `f40`) to ensure the base information is captured.
2. **Interactions and Non-linearities**: Added various operations such as division (`f10 / f4`), multiplication (`f2 * f22`), addition (`f13 + f19`), subtraction (`f11 - f8`), and complex transformations (`f27 cube`) to capture interactions and non-linearities.
3. **Standard Transformations**: Use transformations like `square`, `log`, `tanh`, `sin`, `cos`, `sigmoid`, and `sqrt` on individual features to help capture non-linear relationships and potential interactions.
4. **Data Scaling and Normalization**: Applied scaling and normalization processes like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to standardize features.
5. **Advanced Transformations**: Use transformations such as `quan_trans` and `reciprocal` to further explore non-linear and non-standard relationships.
6. **Balanced Transformation Use**: Ensures a balanced use of transformations across different types of operations (e.g., arithmetic operations, scaling, trigonometric functions).

This transformed feature set aims to enhance the detection of complex relationships in the data, providing potentially better performance in the downstream classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This newly suggested feature set combines selections and transformations from both examples, focusing on diversification of feature engineering techniques and inclusion of additional standard scalers, sigmoids, combination of effective elements through addition, and complex but potentially useful interactions via multiplication and square transformations. Additionally, it maintains several scaling operations and trigonometric functions to potentially normalize and enhance feature interactions.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f37 f34 + square, f24 f0 *, f24 f7 *, f24 f14 *, f24 f26 *, f13 tanh, f13 sigmoid, f35 cos cube f29 +, f24 quan_trans, f34 sigmoid]

2025-09-28 23:53:25,922 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature set examples, I will generate a new feature set that aims to explore potentially useful transformations and interactions among the features. Below is a new and improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f24 f29 - tanh, f35 f34 / square, f26 f2 + stand_scaler, f38 f19 / log, f13 sigmoid, f37 f7 * cube, f6 f15 / sqrt, f36 f4 + minmax_scaler, f9 f20 * reciprocal, f3 f1 - quan_trans]
```

In this new feature set:
- I retained the original features to make sure no existing information is lost.
- I introduced a variety of transformations including `tanh`, `square`, `stand_scaler`, `log`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, `sqrt`, `minmax_scaler`, `reciprocal`, and `quan_trans`.
- I constructed a combination of operations aiming to capture nonlinear relationships and interactions, which can often be important for modeling tasks like classification.

These transformations aim to enhance the model's ability to discern subtle patterns and interactions that could be valuable for differentiating between the two classes—thus potentially improving prediction accuracy for the classification task.

Let's blend various transformations effectively, considering the characteristics of the given feature set and potential improvement ideas.

Here's the new feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: Start with all original features [f0, f1, ..., f40].
- **Non-linear Transforms**: Introduce `tanh`, `log`, `sin`, and `sqrt` functions for non-linearity and to handle different scales of values.
- **Scaling and Normalizing**: Use `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` for normalizing. This helps in bringing different feature scales to a similar range, which is beneficial for many ML models.
- **Feature Interactions**: Multiply and divide combinations like `f0 f1 *`, `f0 f7 /` to explore potential linear and non-linear interactions.
- **Feature Sums**: Combos such as `f0 f7 + f14 f26 +` can capture feature correlations.
- **Advanced Transforms**: Compound operations like `f34 f12 + f13 /` can introduce complexity that might help capture hidden patterns.
- **Square Roots**: Using transformations like `f38 tanh minmax_scaler sqrt` combines the benefits of feature smoothness and range limit.
  
These changes aim to yield a feature set with better representation of potential interactions, non-linear scaling, and transformations suitable for various machine learning models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set not only includes all transformations from the better example you provided but also incorporates additional transformations. These include the square root for select features and combined transformations utilizing simple arithmetic operations followed by the `minmax_scaler`. Such combinations can help capture more complex relationships between features, potentially improving model performance for the classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set retains the combination and interaction terms from the original examples, which leverage both mathematical transformations and interaction effects. The new feature set focuses on various cosine transformations and interactions, along with some non-linear and scaling transformations, which could introduce additional non-linearities and potentially capture more complex relationships within the data.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40,  f10 / f4, f1 square, f5 log, f15 tanh, f24 sin, f17 cos, f22 tanh, f26 sigmoid, f3 square, f30 / f5, f2 * f22, f13 + f19, f27 cube,  f9 minmax_scaler, f11 - f8, f12 sin, f20 sin, f36 quan_trans, f38 reciprocal,  f24 cube, f10 square sqrt, f4 square sqrt,  f0 minmax_scaler, f29 stand_scaler,  f24 minmax_scaler, f38 stand_scaler,  f14 cos, f37 log]

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f10 / f4, f1 square, f5 log, f15 tanh, f24 sin, f17 cos, f22 tanh, f26 sigmoid, f3 square, f30 / f5, f2 * f22, f13 + f19, f27 cube, f9 minmax_scaler, f11 - f8, f12 sin, f20 sin, f36 quan_trans, f38 reciprocal, f24 cube, f10 square sqrt, f4 square sqrt, f0 minmax_scaler, f29 stand_scaler, f24 minmax_scaler, f38 stand_scaler, f14 cos, f37 log, f24 sin]
```

In this combined set, I retained all the operations from the more enriched first example and added the `f24 sin` transformation from the second example, as it is an effective way to capture any periodic or oscillatory trends in the `f24` feature. By incorporating this, we leverage the enhancements of both previous sets for potentially better predictions.

2025-09-28 23:53:56,322 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, we can create a new and improved feature set by selecting transformations that could potentially reveal more meaningful patterns or interactions relevant for classification purposes. In this case, the transformation applied to \( f38 \) (tanh followed by min-max scaling) in the first example and the sigmoid transformation applied to \( f37 \) in the second example suggest selecting and transforming features to enhance discrimination.

Below is a new feature set created by considering potentially insightful transformations on a combination of these or similar ideas:

\[ [f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f37 tanh f38 sigmoid /] \]

This new feature set applies a tanh transformation to \( f37 \) and a sigmoid transformation to \( f38 \), followed by the division operation. This combines non-linear transformations to potentially capture and enhance interactions or nonlinear relationships between features, leading to improved model performance.

### Additions and Enhancements:
- **Sigmoid Transformations Enhanced**: Additional sigmoid transformations are applied to broaden representation capabilities (e.g., `f9 sigmoid sqrt`).
- **Recursive Feature Transformations**: Uses reciprocal and log on selected features to capture inverse relationships and logarithmic scaling.
- **Complex Interactions**: While maintaining pairwise interactions seen in previous sets, extended interactions involve log and reciprocal on key features to enhance capture of non-linear effects.
- **Expanded Use of Transformations**: Integrates previously unused transformations for greater feature variation and potential non-linear pattern capture in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f18 f14 / sin, f0 f1 * f2 + f12 -]
```

In this new feature set:
1. The transformation `f18 f14 / sin` calculates the sine of the division of features `f18` by `f14`, capturing perhaps a specific relationship between these features.
2. The new transformation `f0 f1 * f2 + f12 -` combines multiplication and addition/subtraction, which can capture interactions between `f0`, `f1`, and `f2`, after which `f12` is subtracted to adjust the scale or offset, potentially capturing latent underlying patterns.

This design follows the idea of creating useful interactions and transformations that could contribute to improved model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2025-09-28 23:54:23,047 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two new feature set examples provided, we can see that the second feature set adds a greater number of transformations and scaling operations to the original features than the first set, thus potentially increasing the ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions. Therefore, the task is to create a more advanced feature set inspired by these examples but further improved by combining various transformations and scaling techniques. Here's a suggestion for a new feature set:

This feature set extends the previous transformations by applying various combinations of scaling, activation functions, and transformations such as `sqrt` and `reciprocal`, which can help in capturing more complex patterns in the data.

In this improved feature set, I've retained the transformations that have previously been applied and added some new transformations to potentially capture non-linear relationships and further scale the features:

- Applied additional non-linear transformations like `log` and `reciprocal`.
- Included trigonometric transformations such as `tanh` and `sin` after `stand_scaler` to explore periodic behavior or symmetry.
- Retained other scaling and transformation operations, ensuring continuity with the earlier feature sets. 

These additional transformations aim to introduce new interactions and dimensions in your data, potentially increasing the predictive power in your downstream tasks.

**Explanation:**
- The new set includes a diverse range of non-linear transformations (e.g., `sqrt`, `log`, `cube`, `tanh`, etc.), which help to capture various types of relationships.
- Combined mathematical and statistical operations are used on pairs of features to explore potential interactions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Using feature scaling and normalization transformations (`minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`) can enhance model stability and performance.
- This feature set introduces potential aggregations and composite features that might capture patterns not visible in the original dataset.
- Finally, we continue to use reciprocal transformations to handle potential issues with unity, variance, and distributions. 

By creating a rich and varied feature set, we enable the machine learning algorithms to learn more complex patterns for classifying chemical biodegradability.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:56:04,429 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by combining the two given examples, let's consider incorporating complex interactions or transformations that might capture more nuanced relationships, while also avoiding redundancy. Here is the new feature set:

```json
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f37 f34 + square, f24 f0 *, f24 f7 *, f24 f14 *, f24 f26 *, f13 tanh, f18 f14 / sin, f0 f1 * f2 + f12 -, f25 f19 / cos, f29 log]
```

### Explanation:
- **Kept key interactions from both examples**: For instance, `f37 f34 + square` and `f18 f14 / sin` involve non-linear transformations which might capture higher-order relationships.
- **Combined complementary operations**: The combination of multiplication and sum of multiple features such as `f0 f1 * f2 + f12 -` from the second example can often enhance the capability to capture feature interactions.
- **Introduced diversity through other transformations**: Added `f25 f19 / cos` and `f29 log` which introduce trigonometric and logarithmic transformations to the feature set, potentially capturing different types of correlations.
- **Balanced transformation types and representations**: Ensured not to overly rely on a single type of transformation or overly complex transformations that could lead to overfitting or complicate model interpretation.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f24 sin]

2025-09-28 23:56:07,830 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using the provided examples and transformations, I'll incorporate combinations of transformations to capture complex patterns while maintaining a consistent representation.

Here is a new transformed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f24 f29 - sqrt quan_trans]
```

In this transformation, I first subtract f29 from f24 and then apply both the square root (`sqrt`) transformation and the quantile transformation (`quan_trans`). This can help enhance the feature by reducing non-linearity and scaling it, which is beneficial for many machine learning models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set attempts to capture non-linear relationships and potential interactions between the original features using transformations like reciprocal, trigonometric functions (e.g., `cos`, `sin`), combinations (products and sums), and logarithmic transformations. It also includes new interactions like the product and summation of features to potentially capture higher-order relationships. Additionally, transformations such as `tanh`, `sqrt`, and combinations with `sin` and `cos` aim to introduce non-linear patterns that might be useful in the context of classification tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Addition of Functions**: The transformation `f12 reciprocal` can help manage features with a skewed distribution, converting them into a reciprocal might help to linearize relationships.

2. **Complex Interactions**: `f11 tanh f36 +` adds a small non-linear interaction between two transformations, which could help in capturing non-linear relationships.

3. **Mixed-Logarithmic Transformations**: `f7 f13 * log` uses a logarithmic transformation, which is critical for features that span a wide range.

4. **Combining with Root**: `f34 f40 + sqrt` creates a new feature by combining two features and applying a sqrt, reducing variance and maintaining numeric scale.

5. **Sine Reciprocation**: `f25 f26 / sin` captures the periodic property of sine along with potential emphasis from reciprocal scaling.

6. **Normalized Differences**: `f8 f21 - minmax_scaler` exposes the relative information while normalization helps in maintaining consistent units/scale.

7. **Complex Combinations**: The transformation `f0 f13 f17 * + sqrt` extends the linear relationship to capture complex interactions among features. 

8. **Cubic Transformation**: `f3 f9 + log cube` captures non-linear relationships that might not be captured by linear or basic logarithmic transformations alone.

By leveraging these transformations, we aim to create highly predictive features for classification tasks while ensuring numerical stability with minimal overfitting risk in downstream tasks.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:56:34,947 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set that is better than the previous examples, I'll introduce a combination of transformation techniques to enhance the utility of the features for the downstream task.

Here's the new feature set:

``` 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, sqrt f24 f14 *, sqrt f13 tanh, f29 f35 cos *, f0 f1 * f2 + log, f37 f34 + sin, f24 quan_trans sqrt, f24 f26 * f7 /, f14 minmax_scaler f18 /]
``` 

I have chosen to:

1. Apply the square root to interactions of features, which can reduce skewness and make the data more normally distributed.
2. Utilize a logarithmic transformation, which is useful for converting multiplicative relationships into additive ones, making them easier to model.
3. Combine existing transformations such as `tanh`, `cos`, and `minmax_scaler` with feature interactions.
4. Incorporate `quan_trans`, which can handle non-normal distributions effectively.
5. Use trigonometric and statistical transformations to enhance pattern extraction capabilities without altering the original feature scales drastically.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f37 f34 + square, f24 f0 *, f24 f7 *, f24 f14 *, f24 f26 *, f13 tanh, f13 sigmoid, f35 cos cube f29 +, f24 quan_trans, f34 sigmoid]

```

In this improved version:
- I combined components from both examples to maximize potential diversity and capture complex interactions.
- Added a transformation `f24 f1 + log` to introduce non-linear combinations. 
- Kept operations that have been shown to harness utility in feature engineering like `quan_trans`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh`.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set:
- We've selected a subset of features similarly present in both previous examples.
- We've diversified transformation functions across different operations (e.g., reciprocal, sqrt, tanh, log), especially to enrich non-linearities and capture more patterns.
- Interaction terms (product and addition) are included by pairing potential correlated features that could reveal interactions significant for the target prediction.
- Efforts were made to avoid redundancy, maintaining a range of combinations to leverage the transformations' value.

This enhanced feature set aims to introduce new patterns and complex relationships that could improve the downstream classification task.
