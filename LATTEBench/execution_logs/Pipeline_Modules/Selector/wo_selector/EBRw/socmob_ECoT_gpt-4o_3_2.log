Here is the reasoning behind the choice of transformations in this new feature set:

- `f0 minmax_scaler`: Scaling `f0` helps normalize its range and can enhance the feature's contribution by reducing measurement unit bias.
- `f3 tanh square`: Applying both `tanh` and `square` can help capture non-linear patterns and interactions from `f3`.
- `f4 cube tanh`: Combining `cube` and `tanh` transformations can potentially reveal higher-order interactions and non-linear effects from `f4`.
- `f4 reciprocal`: Adding the reciprocal transformation can assist in capturing inverse relationships in data distribution for `f4`.

These additional transformations complement the previous transformations, exploring different scales and non-linear relationships to improve prediction quality in classification tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation of enhancements:
- Retained transformations like `f4 f4 * tanh` and `f4 f4 f3 + tanh * tanh`, which capture interactions between features and their non-linear transformations.
- Added `f0 f1 + tanh` to explore interactions between `f0` (father's occupation) and `f1` (son's occupation) with a tanh activation, which might highlight potential non-linear relationships.
- Introduced `f2 f4 * sqrt` to consider an interaction between `f2` (family structure) and `f4` (counts for son's first occupation) while applying a square root transformation, possibly capturing more nuanced affects from the family structure on son's occupation count.

This refined feature set aims to improve the predictive power of the model by accounting for non-linear patterns and interactions within the data.

2025-10-21 20:42:23,922 - INFO - llm output = To improve on the feature sets provided, we want to incorporate elements that capture interactions between features and apply transformations that might enhance their predictive power. The goal is to derive new features that could highlight potential patterns or relationships in the data that aren't easily observed from the original features alone.

Here's a proposed improved feature set:

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f3 f4 + tanh tanh ,f3 sigmoid tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f1 cos ,f2 cos ,f3 cos ,f4 cos ,f1 f2 * tanh ,f0 f3 / cos ,f1 f4 * sqrt tanh]

Explanation:
1. **Interactions**: Adding interactions between features such as `f1 f4 * sqrt tanh` can capture potential synergies between different aspects of the father's occupation and the counts for the son's first occupation.

2. **Transformations**: Applying transformations like `cos`, `tanh`, and `sqrt` can help stabilize variance or address non-linear relationships.

3. **Inclusion of Original Features**: Keeping original features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`) ensures that raw data is available for modeling, alongside transformed features.

With these additions, the new feature set should be richer and potentially more informative for predictive modeling tasks.

- We have kept the original features f0, f1, f2, f3, and f4 for baseline analysis.
- We've retained interactive features like f3 f4 + tanh tanh and f1 f2 * tanh.
- We've added a new feature f3 f1 + reciprocal tanh to explore interactions between f3 and f1 with more complex transformations.
- Introduced logistic transformation with f2 f4 * logistic.
- Added a new interaction feature using subtraction and square root transformations: f0 f3 - sqrt cos.

These transformations aim to capture non-linear relationships and interactions among the features, which might be beneficial for classification tasks.

In this new feature set, I combined some of the transformations and interactions that were present in your examples but also explored new interactions that might capture complex relationships better:
- Used non-linear and scaling transformation like `tanh`, `sqrt`, `minmax_scaler`, and `stand_scaler` for normalization and capturing non-linear variations.
- Constructed interaction terms such as `f1 f2 tanh * log` and `f4 f3 + reciprocal tanh *` to explore combined effects in a transformed space. 
- Continued leveraging trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations to introduce non-linearities.

These transformations not only aim to enhance prediction by capturing more intricate relationships but also ensure the features are within a consistent range, which is particularly useful for many machine learning algorithms.

2025-10-21 20:43:11,752 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided examples of transformed feature sets, it appears that an emphasis is placed on using various non-linear transformations, such as `tanh` and `sigmoid`, along with scaling operations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`. These transformations can help capture non-linear relationships and distribute features more uniformly, which could be beneficial for the prediction task.

Given the two examples, the second feature set seems to favor deeper combinations of transformations applied specifically to `f4` using multiple `tanh` operations, alongside the retained original features without transformations. This provides potentially richer transformed features while still leveraging the base data.

Here's a proposition for an improved feature set, combining elements from both examples while maintaining a varied and broad application of transformations and scaling across features:

```

```

Explanation:
- `f1, f2, f3, f4`: Retains original feature values.
- `f4 tanh sigmoid, f4 sigmoid tanh`: Explores combinations of non-linear transformations on `f4`.
- `f4 stand_scaler tanh tanh`: An additional level of transformation for `f4`, incorporating scaling.
- `f0 tanh`: Preserves this transformation from the examples.
- `f2 tanh sqrt, f3 tanh`: Introduces an additional `sqrt` transformation on `f2`.
- `f1 tanh stand_scaler, f2 sqrt minmax_scaler`: Applies standardized scaling, preserving elements from your examples.
- `f3 minmax_scaler tanh`: Combines scaling and non-linear transformations for `f3`.

This feature set aims to maintain a balance of raw, scaled, and non-linearly transformed features to capture complex patterns within the data.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f3 f4 + tanh tanh, f3 sigmoid tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 cos, f4 tanh, f1 f2 * tanh, f2 f3 + tanh, f4 log, f1 f3 * sqrt] 
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f3 f4 + tanh tanh, f3 sigmoid tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 cos, f4 tanh, f1 f2 * tanh, f2 f3 + tanh]

2025-10-21 20:43:15,015 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples and operations, we aim to generate a better feature set that potentially enhances the predictive power of the downstream task. We will carefully select and combine operations that might capture more complex relationships or transformations beneficial for prediction.

Here is one improved feature set based on the examples:

```
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f3 f4 + tanh tanh, f3 sigmoid tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 cos, f4 tanh, f1 f2 * tanh, f2 f3 + tanh, f1 f4 + tanh, f1 f3 * sigmoid, f2 f4 * tanh]
```

**Explanation:**

- **f1 f4 + tanh**: Adding a new feature that combines f1 and f4 before applying the hyperbolic tangent. This could capture interaction effects between features.
- **f1 f3 * sigmoid**: Combines f1 and f3 with multiplication followed by sigmoid transformation, which could help in capturing nonlinear relations.
- **f2 f4 * tanh**: Integrates f2 and f4 with multiplication, then applies tanh to potentially model complex nonlinear dependencies. 

These transformations are designed to explore new interactions and nonlinear relationships between the variables that were not clearly captured in the previous sets.

[f1, f2, f3, f4, f3 f4 + tanh tanh, f3 sigmoid tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 cos, f4 tanh, f1 f2 * tanh, f2 f3 + tanh] 
[f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f3 f4 + tanh tanh ,f3 sigmoid tanh ,f2 tanh ,f3 cos ,f4 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 cos ,f3 tanh]

2025-10-21 20:43:27,664 - INFO - llm output = To generate an improved feature set based on the given examples, we should incorporate techniques that enhance the representation of data through transformations, aggregations, and interactions. Here is a better feature set:

[f1, f2, f3, f4, f3 f4 + tanh tanh, f3 sigmoid tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 cos, f4 tanh, f1 f2 * tanh, f2 f3 + tanh, f1 f3 + tanh, f4 cos, f1 f4 * cos]

In this improved feature set:

- I've incorporated interactions between features, such as f1 f3 + tanh, to capture non-linear relationships.
- Added additional transformations like cos for f4 to provide different perspectives on the feature distribution.
- Enhanced the interaction with more complex operations like f1 f4 * cos, which might highlight specific patterns useful for classification.
