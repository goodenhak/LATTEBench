Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

The aim is to balance transformations and interactions of features that could enhance the model's capability:

- Keep utilizing key transformations like sigmoid, square, and sqrt that can help capture non-linear relationships and reduce the effect of extreme values.
- Incorporate feature interactions, which can capture more complex relationships.

- Direct subtraction with `f18`, which likely helps center the values relative to a particular baseline.
- Use of `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, and `square` operations to manage non-linear relationships and potential scale effects.
- Additional interaction `f0 f4 * sigmoid sqrt` which combines transformations and interactions potentially adding complexity that may help improve predictive accuracy.

2025-10-01 20:39:55,351 - INFO - llm output = To construct a better feature set according to the given examples, we can combine the ideas from the two provided feature sets while considering statistical operations and transformations to enhance the feature set quality. Here is a proposed feature set:

1. Start with fundamental transformations and interactions, utilizing both mathematical and statistical transformations like sin, cube, and minmax_scaler.
2. Focus on combining existing features with operators like addition and subtraction for meaningful feature interactions.
3. Incorporate scaling techniques and standard statistical transformations as necessary, such as minmax_scaler, which can help in normalizing or scaling feature values for better model performance.

Here is the new feature set:

```

### Explanation:

1. **Usage of Diverse Transformations**: Integrated various transformations (`sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`), providing depth to features.
2. **Mixing Mathematical Operations**: By incorporating arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`) with different feature interactions, capturing complex relationships.
3. **Combination Strategy**: Maintained a combination of features with and without scaling to offer different perspectives on the data.
4. **Standardization**: Using `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` allows examining the effects of different normalizations on predictive power.
5. **Innovative Use of Scaling with Non-linearity**: Features are combined and transformed non-linearly to potentially capture hidden patterns.

These considerations aim to enrich the feature space, potentially improving model performance by providing diverse, informative signals.

Here's what I've done with this feature set:
- Combined basic features (`f0`, `f1`, `f4`, `f18`) with transformed versions (stand-scaled, min-max scaled, sigmoid, cos, sin, etc.) to capture different scales and nonlinear relationships.
- Used squared transformations to emphasize larger values which could be significant in decision boundaries.
- Incorporated differences (`f0 f18 -`, `f1 f18 -`, ...) as they can reveal relative importance or interactions between pairs of features.
- Applied a variety of functions including `cos`, `sin`, and `sigmoid` to explore periodic or logistic relationships that might exist within the data.
- Included combinations of sigmoid and other functions like `sqrt` and `cos` for more nuanced feature interpretations.

This feature set aims to capture both linear and non-linear interdependencies between variables, potentially improving the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

We'll incorporate a variety of transformations aiming at capturing complex relationships while retaining meaningful and interpretable transformations.

Here is a proposed new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f8 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f17 ,f18 ,

```

### Explanation:

- **Basic Features:** Retain a selection of basic features that are likely key contributors based on previous sets.
  
- **Transformed Features:** 
  - Use advanced transformations (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `cube`) which can capture nonlinear relationships.
  - Include feature scaling operations such as `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize feature ranges, handling both outliers and scale differences.
  
- **Combined Transformations:** Mix transformations to form new insights (e.g., combining `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` with other operations).

This feature engineering strategy exploits a broad set of mathematical transformations and statistical methods to potentially improve the model's ability to learn and generalize from the data, enhancing the likelihood of better prediction performance in the downstream credit assignment task.

Based on the given examples, we attempt to create a feature set with diverse transformations and combinations suitable for expanding the modeling abilities.

Here is a new feature set:

```

This feature set includes:
1. Basic transformations on all features (like standard scaling) for normalization and variance stabilization.
2. Element-wise operations such as addition followed by square root to capture potential interaction effects.
3. Division combined with `tanh` to create non-linear interaction terms, enhancing feature robustness in models that capture complex relationships.
4. A comprehensive set of individual minmax scaling to potentially enhance feature sensitivity based on ranges.

Such engineered features should ideally provide more nuanced inputs to a model attempting to predict whether a person receives credit, utilizing the complex relationships and interactions that potentially improve prediction accuracy.

2025-10-01 20:40:49,242 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two given sets, we need to focus on combining transformations that capture non-linear relationships or provide normalization/scaling where appropriate. We also want to ensure that the feature set is rich in informative transformations without being excessively large or redundant.

Here's a new feature set proposal:
```plaintext

 f18 cube f4 tanh * cos, 
 f0 cos, 
 f9 sin]
```

Explanation:
1. Retained basic features from both sets: `f0`, `f1`, `f4`, `f5`, `f7`, `f12`, `f18`.
2. Kept non-linear transformations like `tanh` and their combinations with basic operations, as these can capture interactions between features (`f0 f4 tanh *`, `f18 cube f4 tanh *`).
3. Included `stand_scaler` and `quan_trans` transformations for `f18` and a few others, which helps in normalizing the distributions.
4. Used `cos` and `sin` to capture cyclic patterns which are sometimes inherent in financial data.
5. Reduced redundancy by not including excessive transformations that might overlap in the information they provide.

This feature set emphasizes a balance between complexity and interpretability while ensuring coverage of potential non-linear relationships and scaling benefits.

The key objective is to refine the feature engineering process by selecting transformations that could potentially enhance predictive power, ensure diversity among the features, and capture non-linear relationships.

Let's aim to generate more informative features with a variety of transformations that could complement predictive models:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f3 ,f4 ,f6 ,f8 ,f10 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f19 ,f0 square ,f2 f0 / ,f1 reciprocal ,f4 reciprocal ,f11 reciprocal ,f9 log ,f9 sqrt ,f0 sqrt ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f15 minmax_scaler ,f16 minmax_scaler ,f17 minmax_scaler ,f18 minmax_scaler ,f19 minmax_scaler]
```

Explanation of transformations:
- `square` and `sqrt`: Used to explore quadratic relationships and variance stabilization.
- `reciprocal`: To capture multiplicative inverse relations and address skewed distributions.
- `log`: Useful for reducing skewness in highly-skewed distributions and also for multiplicative effects.
- `minmax_scaler`: Helpful to normalize data within a fixed range [0, 1], maintaining the sense of distribution without distortion due to outliers.

I'll aim to include transformations that offer non-linearity and scaling, as these are prevalent in both sets, and include meaningful interactions between features.

Here is one potential improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

In this enhanced feature set:
- We retained some basic standalone features (e.g., `f0, f1, f2` ...) for simplicity and avoided overly complicating too many features.
- Applied various scaling and non-linear transformations (e.g., `sigmoid`, `reciprocal`) that appeared in both given examples.
- A combination of scaling, arithmetic, and non-linear transformations is applied to create complex interactions in feature space (e.g., `f0 minmax_scaler f2 minmax_scaler + sin f4 minmax_scaler f0 + sin - square`).
  
The aim here is to capture potential non-linear relationships and maintain variability in transformations to improve model expressiveness and prediction performance.

In this set:
- Kept the relevant base features: `f0`, `f2`, `f4`, `f12`, `f13`, `f16`, `f18`, `f19`.
- Used complex transformations: The expression `f0 f9 + sin cos sqrt stand_scaler` captures non-linear relationships.
- Introduced a new combination: `f0 f4 * log minmax_scaler` to explore interactions and scale them.
- Utilized advanced mathematical transformations with combinations like `f1 f3 + reciprocal sigmoid sqrt` and `f4 f7 * reciprocal sigmoid sqrt`.
- Retained important basic and non-linear transformations: Sigmoid, reciprocal, and sqrt applied through various feature combinations to ensure a broad representation and transformation diversity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:41:25,394 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, we want to create a new feature set that improves prediction capabilities by maximizing information extraction and minimizing redundancy. This new set should combine and enrich the transformations and interactions present in the previous examples.

Let's analyze the initial feature sets provided and then create a superior version:

1. **Core Features (f0 to f19):** We'll retain all core features in the new set.

2. **Standard Transformations:**
   - Continue using transformations like `cos`, `sin`, `sigmoid`, and scaling (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`) for non-linear feature extraction and normalization.
   - Use standard scaling and quantile transformation, as seen in the examples, to handle potential outliers and non-Gaussian distributions.

3. **Complex Interactions and Transformations:**
   - Retain complex transformations such as cubes and element-wise operations to capture non-linear interactions.
   - Consider using `cube` and `/` operations to enhance interactions between critical features (e.g., employment duration, credit history).

4. **Postfix Expression Construction:**
   - Enhance non-linear transformations by introducing more sophisticated feature interactions or functional transformations that were not overly utilized but can capture unique non-linear patterns.

Here's a suggested superior feature set combining the strengths and reducing redundancy:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f5 cos sigmoid ,f9 cos f0 + sigmoid ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f9 sin ,f19 stand_scaler ,f18 f8 / ,f18 cos ,f9 quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans ,f0 cube ,f1 cube ,f2 cube ,f3 cube ,f4 cube ,f5 cube ,f6 cube ,f14 cube ,f11 cube ,f12 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f15 cube sin ,f16 cube sin ,f0 sin ,f1 sin ,f2 sin ,f3 sin ,f4 sin ,f6 sin ,f7 sin]
```

**Rationale**:
- The core features are retained.
- Diverse non-linear functions (`cos`, `sin`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`) continue to be applied to capture intricate patterns.
- Cube transformation intensifies feature contrasts potentially beneficial for deeper learning models.
- We use `tanh` to further transform numerical features `f12` and `f10`, aiming for saturating transformations beneficial for classification tasks.
- Interaction terms like `f18 f8 /` have been kept, hypothesizing an interaction effect significant enough to preserve.

Here's a new feature set, building upon the previous ones and integrating additional complexity:

**Explanation**:
1. **Feature Interactions**: The transformations include interactions between multiple features using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and cube functions—the latter providing nonlinearity that helps model complex relationships.
2. **Using **tanh**, **cos**, and **sqrt**: These functions introduce nonlinear transformations, helping to normalize effects of outliers and nonuniform distributions within the feature space—emphasizing nonlinear relationships.
3. **Normalization Techniques**: Both standard scaling and min-max scaling are utilized as essential preprocessing steps to stabilize and bring uniformity to feature ranges across the dataset, making computations more robust.
4. **Balance and Complexity**: Features are transformed to include nonlinear aspects but not in excessive depth to prevent overly complex models or curse of dimensionality issues.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

In this new feature set:
- I've integrated both transformational operations like `stand_scaler`, `cube`, `square`, and `sin` which are generally useful for normalizing and transforming features for better model performance.
- I've kept several scaled, squared, and cubed features from both sets that might perform well in combination with standard scaling techniques.
- Retained meaningful features from both examples and added potentially beneficial transformations, ensuring a comprehensive feature representation.

This feature set aims to incorporate a variety of transformations with balanced coverage across multiple factors, potentially improving the predictive model's ability to differentiate between classes.

### Key Considerations:
- **Diversity of Operations**: Including a mix of operations (sigmoid, reciprocal, cos, log, sqrt) captures various transformations for nonlinearities.
- **Depth of Transformations**: Using layered operations like `sigmoid sigmoid` and transformations to a square root extend the transformation capacity.
- **Focus on Important Features**: More transformations are applied to features deemed more significant, which may involve exploratory analysis or domain knowledge (e.g., `f0`, `f4`).
- **Interactions**: Combining transformations may implicitly capture potential interaction effects between features.

2. Preserve useful transformation patterns like `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `cos`, `sin`, and `cube`.
3. Introduce new transformations such as `log` for `f12` and `f10`, which can help in dealing with skewness.
4. Create an interaction term `f9 + f19 stand_scaler` to explore potential combined effects of these features.
5. Maintain a balance of mathematical transformations to ensure the feature set can provide varied insights.

We will use a mixture of transformations and operations that seem promising from the given examples and some new combinations.

Here's a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f17 ,f19 ,f5 cos sigmoid ,f9 cos f0 + sigmoid ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f9 stand_scaler ,f18 f8 / ,f18 cube ,f18 cos ,f19 cube ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f4 tanh ,f9 minmax_scaler tanh ,f10 log ,f11 log ,f12 log ,f14 log ,f15 log ,f0 sin ,f1 sin ,f2 sin ,f3 sin ,f5 sin ,f6 sin ,f7 sin ,f14 sin ,f9 sin ,f15 sin ,f15 quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans]

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Features:**: Start with a selection of the most critical raw features like `[f0, f1, ..., f19]`.

2. **Combinations and Useful Transformations:**
   - **cos**, **sin**, **tanh**, **sigmoid** are used to capture non-linear relationships.
   - **cube** and **log** are applied to some features for skewness correction and enhanced variance.
   - **minmax_scaler**, **stand_scaler**, **quan_trans** are used to bring features to a similar scale, improve distributions, or introduce quantile transformations where appropriate.

3. **Feature Engineering:**:
   - Includes interaction terms like `f9 cos f0 + sigmoid` to exploit feature interactions.
   - Use of `f18 f8 /` and transformations to explore potential correlations between key features.

This feature set aims to create a robust representation capturing multiple aspects of the data distribution and interactions, enhancing the likelihood of discovering meaningful patterns in the downstream predictive task.

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Features:** I maintained some basic features (like checking_status, duration, etc.) because these are fundamental to the dataset and provide intrinsic value.

2. **Squared and Stand-scaled Features:** Squared transformations are applied to select features based on potential non-linear relationships. The standard scaling is also applied to adjust the distribution to have zero mean and unit variance, enhancing model performance.

3. **Trigonometric and Non-linear Transformations:** Incorporating trigonometric transformations like `sin`, `cos`, and non-linear transformations such as `sigmoid` and `sigmoid` can capture cyclic patterns or handle skewness in the data.

4. **Interaction Terms:** Including interactions of features like `f1 f2 /` and `f3 f4 *` might highlight relationships not evident through individual features alone.

5. **Square Root and Cosine Transformations:** Applying transformations like the cosine of square root combinations can help uncover latent relationships in the data.

This combination strives to enhance feature variability, handle potential non-linear relationships, and adjust for feature scale discrepancies, collectively boosting model accuracy in predicting credit approval.

2025-10-01 20:42:13,300 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the examples provided, I'll aim to balance complexity and utility by selecting transformations that could potentially capture more nuanced relationships in the data for credit prediction. The features selected should provide new insights or emphasize existing patterns more effectively.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f2 ,f4 ,f19 ,f0 sigmoid ,f4 sigmoid ,f0 sigmoid sigmoid ,f2 sigmoid sigmoid ,f4 sigmoid sigmoid ,f0 cos ,f1 cos ,f2 cos ,f4 cos ,f7 cos ,f10 cos ,f11 cos ,f12 cos ,f13 cos ,f14 cos ,f15 cos ,f16 cos ,f17 cos ,f0 sigmoid sqrt ,f4 sigmoid sqrt ,f0 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt ,f2 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt ,f4 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt ,f6 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt ,f0 reciprocal sigmoid sqrt ,f11 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt ,f15 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt ,f1 reciprocal sigmoid sqrt ,f4 reciprocal sigmoid sqrt ,f11 reciprocal sigmoid sqrt ,f0 cos sqrt ,f2 cos sqrt ,f3 cos sqrt ,f4 cos sqrt ,f6 cos sqrt ,f12 cos sqrt ,f7 cos sqrt ,f10 cos sqrt ,f11 cos sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f13 sqrt]
```

**Justification:**
- **Inclusion of `f19`**: Keeps a balance between past feature sets to ensure any strongly predictive features aren't omitted.
- **Inclusion of `f13 sqrt`**: Such transformations can help in normalizing skewed data or capturing non-linear relationships, potentially offering a better perspective for predictions.
- **Endorsing complex combinations**: Such as `sigmoid sigmoid sqrt`, `cos sqrt`, or `reciprocal sigmoid sqrt` that might model interactions and distributions more robustly.
- **Coherence**: Ensuring the continuity of transformations across all the features, capturing possible periodic patterns via `cos` and non-linear scaling through `sigmoid`.

This enhanced feature set aims to encapsulate the derived knowledge from previous transformations while also introducing subtle improvements to foster better predictive performance in downstream tasks.

2025-10-01 20:42:20,546 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! Using the two feature sets you provided as references, I'll create a new, enhanced feature set by combining and optimizing the transformations applied in each. Here's a new feature set:

```

### Explanation:
1. **Enhanced Transformation Combinations**: I've taken advantage of the transformation techniques (such as stand_scaler, cube, and square) from both sets, combining them in enhanced sequences for certain features.
2. **Complex Feature Creations**: I've created more complex features by chaining multiple transformations, like applying `log` after `quan_trans` and using `sqrt` after `quan_trans`.
3. **Incorporated Range Normalization**: Using `stand_scaler` strategically to help normalize feature distributions that potentially have higher variance or outliers. 
4. **Diverse Transformations for Different Features**: Combined different transformations for different features to ensure a rich feature space that captures non-linear patterns and interactions.

This new set aims to balance the transformations observed in both given sets, strives to enhance feature performance, and provides a diverse feature space for predictive modeling.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2025-10-01 20:42:26,866 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, we can create a better feature set by combining useful transformations and ensuring we retain important features. Here is an improved version of the feature set by integrating and expanding on the transformations used in both examples:

```

```

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Included Original Features**: Included a broad selection of original features (f0 to f19) to ensure the comprehensive input data is maintained.
  
2. **Transformations Chosen**:
    - Kept cosine, sigmoid, and sin transformations on features where they appeared in both original sets.
    - Included additional cube transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
    - Included several scaling methods (standardization, quantile transformation, min-max scaling) to ensure features with different distributions are standardized.
    - Applied log, tanh, and reciprocal transformations on some features to handle heavy-tailed or skewed distributions.

3. **New Transformations Suggested**:
    - Applied `log` and `tanh` transformations on select features to better capture non-linear relationships.
    - Used reciprocal on a feature potentially to stabilize variance.

By including a diverse set of transformations, we cover a wider range of potential feature importance, following the observed patterns from both sets.

### Explanation:
1. **Trigonometric Transformations (e.g., sin, cos):** These can help capture underlying cyclical patterns.
2. **Power Transformations (e.g., cube, sqrt):** These introduce nonlinearity and can help with skewed distributions.
3. **Scaling (e.g., minmax_scaler, stand_scaler):** These normalize features, useful for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.
4. **Log and Reciprocal Transformations:** These are useful for reducing skewness and handling variations in scale.

In this new set of features:
- Reciprocal transformations are applied to some of the cosine squared terms, which can potentially stabilize variance and improve generalization.
- The combination with sqrt and reciprocal operations can help capture nonlinear relationships.
- Focus is placed on evolving existing features combinations whose transformations might aid model predictions.

These transformations should help in capturing feature interactions and nonlinearities that might improve prediction efficacy in the downstream credit approval task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

I'll include transformations that have shown potential from both examples and attempt to introduce unique transformations that might enhance feature richness. Here's a potential improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

In this enhanced feature set, I've added:
- `f9 reciprocal`: Adds a feature using the reciprocal transformation for `f9`, which could help in cases where the inverse ratio is more predictive.
- `f12 minmax_scaler f10 + tanh`: Combines min-max scaling and tanh transformation to potentially capture non-linear patterns or interactions between `f12` and `f10`.
- `f6 sigmoid f1 *`: Incorporates a sigmoid transformation multiplied by another feature (`f1`) to explore non-linear multipliers of `f6`.

These additional transformations and interactions are aimed at broadening the potential expressions derived from the raw data to capture complex patterns in the data.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```

In this new set:
- I've added interactions between existing transformed features and other features (e.g., `f18 f17 * minmax_scaler`).
- Included additional mathematical transformations (e.g., `tanh`, `log`, `sqrt`).
- Mixed various transformations to potentially capture nonlinear relationships (e.g., `f6 f14 + cos`, `f14 f16 + sin`).
- Introduced combinations of transformations which are already present in the second set with other features not used extensively (e.g., `f12 f15 - reciprocal`).

These additions should cover a wider range of potential relationships between the features, potentially improving the model's predictive performance.

**Explanation**:

1. **Original Features**: Included a selection of original features (f0, f1, ..., f19) that were predominantly present across the datasets. These represent potentially raw important features.
   
2. **Statistical and Non-linear Transformations**:
   - **Cosine and Sigmoid Transforms**: Utilized for capturing cyclic patterns and squashing values between 0 and 1. This is seen in transformations like `f5 cos sigmoid`.
   - **Scaler Transforms**: Standardization and normalization (using `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, etc.) are crucial for ensuring that features are on comparable scales, beneficial before non-linear models.
   - **Cube and Sine Transforms**: Useful for detecting non-linear relationships not captured by linear or simple polynomial terms.
   - **Additional Operations**: `sqrt` transforms help in reducing extreme value effects and help normalize distributions.
   - **Tanh and Sigmoid Combinations**: For capturing effects in bounded transformations, especially useful in neural network preparations.
   - **New Interaction Features**: Derived features like `f5 f6 * tanh` and `f2 f4 / cos` introduce potential interactions between features that might carry hidden relationships enhancing model learning.

This feature set aims to balance between keeping the important base features and exploring additional interactions that may reveal complex underlying patterns in the data, which could be pivotal for the prediction task.

Explanation of improvements:
1. **Complex Combinations:** Utilized combinations of cube, sqrt, log, and tanh operations with certain features to both emphasize non-linear relationships and manage smaller scales.
2. **Normalization Techniques:** Incorporated stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, and reciprocal to stabilize variance across features, contributing to robust model training.
3. **Trigonometric Functions:** Applied cos and tanh functions strategically to maintain periodic aspects where relevant and smooth gradients in feature space.
4. **Exclusivity and Redundancy Reduction:** Reduced redundancy by minimizing repetitive transformations focusing on diverse combinations to increase feature distinctiveness.

This feature set strives to unlock deeper information within the existing features, hence aiding downstream tasks in producing more accurate credit predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:43:39,801 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set from the given examples, we need to combine them efficiently while introducing diversity and complexity, ensuring that we maintain the format and constraints. Using techniques like normalization, scaling, and transformations like trigonometric functions and operations on transformed features, we can enhance the feature set.

Here's an improved feature set that combines elements from both examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f5 ,f7 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f13 ,f18 ,f0 f9 + tanh ,f1 f4 tanh * cos ,f4 sin ,f5 cos tanh ,f6 sin cube ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f9 cos f19 + sigmoid ,f9 sqrt ,f10 f4 * cube ,f12 cos sigmoid ,f14 tanh ,f19 quan_trans ,f18 reciprocal f8 + ,f19 f0 / sin ,f0 f0 * cube ,f1 f1 * cube ,f3 f3 * cube ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 sin ,f18 sin sigmoid ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f11 f11 * minmax_scaler ,f16 sin ,f18 tanh minmax_scaler]
```

In this enhanced feature set:
- **Basic transformations** like `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `sqrt`, `sigmoid` are used extensively to introduce non-linear characteristics which can help capture interactions.
- **Scaling techniques** like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` help to standardize or normalize feature ranges, crucial for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude.
- Varied **composite features** (like coupling with operations such as addition, multiplication, division, etc.) are introduced, which can potentially capture complex patterns.

This diverse and complex feature set is built to improve the downstream predictive task.

2025-10-01 20:43:51,788 - INFO - llm output = When evaluating the feature sets and generating a better one, the goal is to find transformations that enhance predictive power, represent non-linear relationships effectively, and offer robust scaling or normalization. Let's design a new feature set based on the provided examples:

1. Retain essential original features while ensuring a variety of transformations are applied to improve model accuracy.
2. Use operations that cater to different types of data, such as cube for amplifying the impact of lower values and sin or cos for cyclical patterns.
3. Implement scaling to maintain computational efficiency and mitigate outliers' effects.

Here's a derived feature set:

```plaintext

```

In this set, we've integrated cubes and squares to capture polynomial relationships, used sqrt to ensure amplitude adjustments, applied sigmoid and tanh for non-linear scaling, and maintained a variety of scaling and transformation methods to cater to different data distributions.
