2025-10-21 20:12:35,943 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets you've provided, let's analyze their constructions and improve upon them:

1. The first feature set uses various operations on the original features, including multiplication, sine transformation, and combinations of these with feature four (`f4`), such as `f4 f0 f3 * *`.

2. The second feature set keeps the original features and introduces scaling and sine operations, using `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` transformations, which are typically helpful in normalizing or standardizing the data, respectively.

To create a new and improved feature set, we'll consider the benefits of normalizing transformations and employ them creatively alongside other transformations that can bring non-linearity, to harness useful information from relationships between features:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f0 f4 * reciprocal ,f0 f3 / log ,f4 square tanh ,f4 f0 f3 * * quan_trans]
```

Explanation of the new features:

- `f3 stand_scaler`: Standardizes feature 3 to have zero mean and unit variance, often useful for machine learning models.
- `f4 minmax_scaler`: Scales feature 4 to be between 0 and 1, bringing comparability between features.
- `f0 f4 * reciprocal`: Takes the interaction between features 0 and 4 and applies a reciprocal transformation to capture inverse relationships.
- `f0 f3 / log`: Divides feature 0 by feature 3 and applies a logarithmic transformation to mitigate skewness or highlight multiplicative relationships.
- `f4 square tanh`: Squares feature 4 to emphasize larger values and applies the hyperbolic tangent transformation for non-linear scaling.
- `f4 f0 f3 * * quan_trans`: The quantile transformation is applied to the multiplication of features 4, 0, and 3, helping to make the resulting feature more Gaussian-like, which is generally favorable for many modeling tasks.

This new feature set takes advantage of scaling and non-linear transformations to potentially uncover intricate relationships within the data that could improve downstream predictions.

**Explanation and Rationale:**
1. **Basic Arithmetic**: Simple operations like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are used to capture interactions between features.
2. **Tanh Transformation**: It's effective in handling non-linear relationships and reducing the influence of outliers.
3. **Stand Scaler**: Standardizes data by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, which helps algorithms perform better (commonly used with linear models).
4. **Cube Transformation**: Introduces non-linearity and can capture interactions between terms.
5. **Log Transformation**: Useful for dealing with exponential growth patterns or right-skewed data.

This combination aims to explore interactions and non-linear relationships, standardizing where necessary to ensure consistent scaling across features.

```

Explanation:
- Retained useful feature transformations from both examples, such as `f4 sqrt sqrt`, which stabilizes variance.
- Added interaction terms like `f3 tanh f4 sqrt +` to capture complicated relationships between the features.
- Used `tanh` and `cos` transformations to capture potential non-linear relationships.
- Incorporated `f4 minmax_scaler` to normalize the data, which can improve convergence and model accuracy.
- Used transformations like `quan_trans` and `sin` on complex interactions to add flexibility to the model.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Redundancy Reduction**: Many operations in the given feature sets were repetitive. These redundancies were reduced by combining similar expressions and focusing on the distinct features implied by the "better" expressions in the provided examples.

2. **Efficient Use of Operations**: Complex nested expressions like differences and scaling are used strategically to potentially uncover nonlinear relationships.

3. **Feature Diversity and Complexity**: Create diverse transformations (e.g., subtraction, scaling, cube) to capture various aspects of the data.

4. **Standarization and Non-linear Transforms**: Apply transformations like standard scaling and cube, which often help in highlighting scaling issues or nonlinear relations.

The aim is to maintain a balance between complexity and utility, seeking to offer as much predictive power as possible while avoiding unnecessary computational cost. This should provide a feature set poised to give better performance on the stated prediction task.

```

Explanation:
- Retained features `f4` and `f3 sin` which appear in both examples, indicating potential importance.
- Retained `f4 sqrt f3 * sin` which combines the `sqrt` and `sin` transformations and multiplication seen in both examples.
- Retained original `f4 sin` for potential non-linear transformation benefits.
- Used `f0 f2 *` and `f0 f2 * minmax_scaler` from the second example for potential interactions between father's and son's occupations, including a scaled version.
- Included features like `f1 f3 *`, `f3 f0 *`, and `f3 f3 *` to capture interaction terms from example two.
- Retained `f4 stand_scaler sin` and `f4 f0 f3 * * minmax_scaler sin` as complex features that combine multiple transformations and scalings, inspired by both examples.

This new feature set attempts to leverage transformations and interactions while incorporating scaling methods that may help in improving the model's predictions.

- `f4 cube sqrt quan_trans`: Applies cubic transformation and square root followed by a quantile transformation for normalization, capturing non-linear and skewed distributions.
- `f4 f0 * f3 square`: Interaction between `f4` and `f0`, then highlighted by squaring `f3` to amplify this feature's effect.
- `f4 f1 * f2 square`: Interaction between `f4` and `f1` along with squared `f2`, potentially useful for capturing relationships involving these features.
- `f4 sqrt f3 sin`: Combines a square root of `f4` with the sine of `f3` to capture periodic patterns or cycles in relationships.
- `f1 square tanh`: Applies squaring and then a hyperbolic tangent to `f1` to model non-linear responses and caps extreme values.
- `f2 square quan_trans`: Squares `f2` and applies quantile transformation to produce a smoothed version, beneficial for outlier-adjustment.
- `f3 square tanh`: Square transformation with a tanh activation function to control extremities and enhance feature representation's expressiveness.

The first set uses basic features and simple arithmetic operations, while the second set improves upon this by using a combination of the original features and differences, incorporating additional arithmetic transformations that involve different orderings and subtractions across multiple features.

A better feature set would continue to build on these ideas, potentially enhancing variability with more complex interactions or transformations while maintaining some measure of simplicity for interpretability.

Here is a suggested better feature set based on the examples:

```
[f2, f3, f4, f1 f3 - , f4 f2 - , f1 f0 f2 - - , f2 f0 f3 - - , f3 f0 f1 - - , f4 f1 f3 - - , f2 f4 f0 f0 - - - , f1 f2 f3 * f4 / - , f2 f3 f4 * f1 / -]

This new feature set includes:

1. Retained original features `f2`, `f3`, `f4` for baseline information.
2. Simple pairwise differences like `f1 f3 -` and `f4 f2 -`.
3. Introduced combinations of three features with subtraction like `f1 f0 f2 - -`, `f2 f0 f3 - -`, and `f4 f1 f3 - -`, which are further transformations from the original sets.
4. More complex transformations involving all four features with subtraction and division to introduce non-linear relationships, e.g., `f1 f2 f3 * f4 / -` which introduces multiplicative interactions followed by a subtraction for potential synergy patterns.

This feature set seeks to balance complexity with potential interpretability and relevance to the prediction task by leveraging interaction terms.

Explanation of the changes:
- I've retained core features like `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, and transformations such as `f4 sin`, and `f4 sqrt sin`, which provide meaningful non-linear transformations.
- I combined existing transformations like `f3 f4 sqrt * sin` to explore interactions between features with transcendental transformations.
- Added a logarithmic transformation `f4 log` to handle potential skewness in `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
- Kept scaling via `f0 f2 * minmax_scaler` since scaling can ensure better model performance by harmonizing feature scales.
- Introduced `f3 f3 * sqrt` to capture a more intricate polynomial relationship from feature 3.

2025-10-21 20:14:24,966 - INFO - llm output = To design a new feature set that potentially improves prediction accuracy while maintaining the same format, I'll consider generating new features using transformations that can help with non-linearity and distribution adjustments in the data.

Let's aim for a feature set that includes a variety of transformations to capture different aspects of the data. Here's a possible new feature set:

```
[f4 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 sqrt , f1 log , f2 log , f3 log , f4 reciprocal , f1 sin , f2 cos , f3 tanh , f4 cube  f1 minmax_scaler]
```

In this feature set:
- Basic features are included as is (`f4`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`).
- A variety of transformations are applied to `f4`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to potentially capture non-linear relationships (e.g., `sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `cube`).
- The `minmax_scaler` is used to potentially bring a feature into a range that might be more suitable for certain learning algorithms. 

By using this mixture of transformations and scaling, the feature set may better represent variations in the data and improve prediction performance.

Key ideas for improvement in this feature set:
1. We've kept and modified expressions combining differences between features as they capture relative differences which can be meaningful.
2. The expression `f2 f4 - f4 f0 - -` utilizes both subtraction and double subtraction which can capture significant relative changes.
3. The expression `f2 f3 f4 - f0 - -` introduces a more complex multi-step relative difference, potentially revealing deeper insights.
4. `f4 f0 - f2 +` adds variation by connecting differences and additions.
5. The inclusion and positioning of base features (`f0`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`) provides the opportunity for models to learn directly from raw inputs alongside engineered features.

Explanation:
- Multiple transformations are applied to `f4` (counts_for_sons_first_occupation) because it is numerical and can greatly benefit from transformations.
- Non-linear transformations like `square`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `tanh` are used to capture complex patterns.
- Interaction terms (e.g., `f0 f4 *`, `f1 f4 /`) can reveal relationships between features which might not be apparent when features are considered independently.

Explanation:
- Retained basic features (`f2`, `f3`, `f4`) as before.
- Incorporated complex transformations like `f4 minmax_scaler tanh square quan_trans` for a range-scaled and non-linear transformation.
- Included a more straightforward non-linearity with `f4 cube` to capture cubic relationships.
- Applied `quan_trans` to features `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to normalize or transform them into a distribution that could be more statistically robust.
- Used a root-based transformation `f4 f4 * sqrt` for a polynomial feature.
- Continued to include sinusoidal transformations with `f1 sin`, `f2 sin`, and `f3 sin` to capture potential periodic trends.
- Added a new cross-product feature scaled with `minmax_scaler`, such as `f0 f4 * minmax_scaler`, to capture interactions normalized over the dataset. 

This feature set leverages complex transformations with scaling and normalization to likely enhance generalization and capture latent patterns.

Explanation:
1. Added `f1 f2 /` to capture the ratio between two features, which might reflect relative importance or influence.
2. Used `sqrt` and `tanh` for normalization and capturing non-linear relationships.
3. Mixed up `(f3 f2 - f4 +)` to observe the combined influence of these features with addition.
4. Incorporated `sqrt` and `tanh` transformations to help with scaling and potential non-linear effects.
5. Introduced `(f3 f3 f2 - f1 f4 - f3 - - f4 f2 f4 - f1 f4 - f3 - - - - -)` to explore more complex interactions.

This set attempts to incorporate a wider range of transformations such as `tanh`, `sin`, and `cos`, as well as modifying the scaling approach to see if it yields more significant improvements in predictive power. The use of various scaling techniques like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` coupled with mathematical transformations aims to capture different aspects of data variation, which can be beneficial for model training.

Explanation:
- Retained the base features f0 through f4 as they represent the original information.
- Kept f4 minmax_scaler tanh square quan_trans tanh, which provides a compounded nonlinear transformation that could capture complex relationships.
- Kept individual square root transformations as they can help in normalizing the variance.
- Retained f1 and f2 log transformations to manage potential skewness.
- Added f4 log to account for skewness in the numerical target distribution.
- Included f1 cos and f2 cos to introduce periodic transformation elements which can occasionally reveal subtle patterns.
- Retained f2 tanh for its ability to transition smoothly between values, which might uncover non-linear relationships.
- Newly added f4 stand_scaler, which normalizes the feature to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, helping potential model generalization by having features on a similar scale.

Here’s a breakdown of the strategy for feature selection:

1. **Complex Combinations and Interactions**: Create features by combining existing features and applying non-linear transformations such as cube and tanh. These can help capture more complex relationships and enhance predictive capability.

2. **Scaling and Normalization**: Using `stand_scaler` helps the model process features more effectively by standardizing them. This can lead to improved convergence behavior in learning algorithms.

3. **Simplicity in Some Measurements**: Keep some features straightforward and close to original data when they're used alone but apply transformations to enhance directly useful metrics.

This approach should provide a balanced complexity and effectiveness for improving model predictions based on the characteristics and challenges presented by the dataset.
