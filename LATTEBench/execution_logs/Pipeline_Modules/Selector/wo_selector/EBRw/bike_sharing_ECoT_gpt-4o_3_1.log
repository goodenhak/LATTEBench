```

### Explanation:

1. **Retained Features**: Retained many features from the latter set since it is considered better. This includes individual features (`f3`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, `f11`) and some complex transformations that leverage feature interactions and non-linear transformations.
  
2. **Feature Interactions and Transformations**:
   - The non-linear transformations (e.g., `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `cube`) are useful for capturing complex relationships in the data.
   - Kept the multiplication and addition operations since they introduce interaction between features which could be essential for modeling the problem space.
  
3. **New Additions**:
   - Added `f10 f7 +` as this interaction is based on the critical features `f10` and `f7`, which wasn't explicitly present in the previous examples but follows the structure of interactions in the examples given.

4. **Removed Redundancies**: 
   - Not all interactions or features might be necessary. Simplified by removing some redundant or less informative transformations where possible to mitigate potential overfitting and to make the feature set more interpretable.

By focusing on capturing various interactions and non-linearities, this revised set aims to provide richer inputs for downstream machine learning models, leading to potentially improved predictive performance.

Both examples utilize scaling, interaction terms, and non-linear transformations. Let's maintain these strategies while introducing diversity in feature transformations. Here’s an enhanced feature set:

```

### Explanation:

1. **Scaling/Normalization**: Applied standard scaling and reciprocal transformations, important for models sensitive to feature magnitudes.
   
2. **Non-linear transformations**: 
   - **Cube and square**: Used on several features for capturing non-linear relationships.
   - **Log**: Applied on `f0` as a common transformation for right-skewed distributions.
   - **Sin/Cos**: Applied on `f8` (temperature features) to capture cyclical nature, possibly reflecting seasonal patterns.

3. **Feature Interactions**: 
   - Included interactions such as products and tanh transformations, capturing interactions and non-linear relationships between features.
   - Included a more complex interaction \( f10 \cdot f10 \cdot \frac{1}{f0} \) for added complexity, capturing potential quadratic relationships adjusted by a feature.
   
The resulting feature set aims to tease out complex interactions and non-linear relationships in the data, which can help in improving model predictions.

2025-11-07 15:21:37,644 - INFO - llm output = To generate an improved feature set for predicting the count of rental bikes, we will combine feature transformations and interactions creatively based on the patterns observed in the given feature sets. The goal is to capture complex relationships between input features which may boost the prediction accuracy.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f1 f3 + ,f1 f9 + ,f3 f10 + ,f3 f10 f8 * + ,f2 sin ,f8 sin ,f9 sin ,f10 sin ,f2 stand_scaler sin ,f8 stand_scaler sin ,f9 stand_scaler sin ,f10 stand_scaler sin ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f3 cube sin ,f8 cube sin ,f3 cube sin tanh ,f8 cube sin tanh]
```

Explanation of new features:
- We have included the basic features as individual elements to ensure baseline information is available.
- The feature combinations like `f1 f3 +`, `f1 f9 +`, and `f3 f10 +` might capture linear interactions between these important numerical features that were meaningful in previous examples.
- The term `f3 f10 f8 * +` is a more advanced interaction capturing the product of some features and their sum, which might capture complex dependencies.
- We retained non-linear transformations such as `sin` and `tanh` on standardized versions of features like `f2`, `f8`, `f9`, and `f10` to accommodate periodic or threshold behaviors.
- The `cube sin` transformation captures some non-linearities, followed by `tanh` to squish outputs within a manageable range, potentially enhancing the model's ability to learn intricate patterns.

This feature set should provide a comprehensive view of the underlying data patterns and improve predictive performance.

2025-11-07 15:21:54,197 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new, improved feature set based on the examples provided, we'll aim to combine different transformations in a meaningful way that could capture potential non-linear relationships in the data and enhance model performance. The focus will be on using transformations that can produce meaningful features, and the combinations should reflect useful interactions between the original features.

Here's a new feature set example:

```

**Explanation**:
1. **Reciprocal and Standard Scaling**: Apply to f8 for normalization.
2. **Difference and Min-Max Scaling**: Capture differences and scale between f3 and f2, f3 and f0, which may highlight relative changes in magnitude.
3. **Augmentations with Additions and Multiplication**: The additions and multiplications help in capturing any nonlinear interactions.
4. **Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions**: Applied to capture cyclical patterns and non-linear transformations.
5. **Square Root and Tanh**: Use of non-linear transformations for potential variance stabilization and normalization.

Each transformation aims to capture specific relationships or alterations in the dataset to expose new dimensions of the data that might correlate with the rental count.

Below is a suggested feature set, leveraging existing transformations and introducing a combination of new ones:

```

### Explanation of the Feature Set:

1. **Basic Features:**
   - `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`: These are included as they represent core features like season, year, month, etc.

2. **Standardized Feature:**
   - `f8 stand_scaler`: Standard scaled version of the `temp` feature.

3. **Quantile Transformation:**
   - `f0 quan_trans`, `f2 quan_trans`, `f3 quan_trans`, `f8 quan_trans`, `f9 quan_trans`, `f10 quan_trans`: Quantile transformed versions of multiple features to handle skewness.

4. **Sigmoid Transformation:**
   - `f1 sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation of the `year` feature helps to map this into a smoother range.

5. **Min-Max Scaling:**
   - `f1 minmax_scaler`: Scaled `year` feature for normalization.

6. **Cosine Transformation:**
   - `f1 cos`: Adds a non-linear perspective to the `year` feature.

7. **Squared Features:**
   - `f0 square`, `f2 square`, `f3 square`, `f8 square`, `f10 square`, `f11 square`: Squared features to capture non-linear relationships.

8. **Product of Reciprocal:**
   - `f9 f2 reciprocal *`: Creates an interaction feature between `feel_temp` and `month` to capture combined effects, useful in interaction-heavy tasks like demand forecasting.

9. **Standard Scaled Square:**
   - `f8 square stand_scaler`: Further transform the squared `temp` feature to scale the quadratic effect into a standard range.

These transformations aim to capture non-linear relationships, interactions, and normalize the features to improve the predictiveness of the model.

2025-11-07 15:22:12,938 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! Based on the given examples, here's a better feature set that incorporates some sophisticated transformations, aiming to capture complex relationships and improve prediction performance:

```

```

### Key Additions:

1. **Combination Features:**
   - `f3 f8 + cube`: This feature captures interaction between the hour and temperature by adding their min-max scaled values and cubing the result, which helps in identifying patterns over time and temperature changes.

2. **Non-linear Transformation:**
   - `f1 f10 * f3 tanh`: This feature multiplies the year value with `windspeed` and then applies `tanh` after multiplying with `hour`, emphasizing non-linear relationships involving yearly trends that may affect rental patterns.
   
3. **Hybrid Interactions:**
   - `f8 f2 * f11 sqrt`: This feature involves the product of `temp` and `month` with `windspeed`, applying a square root transformation to remove some skewness and stabilize the variance, potentially capturing intricate temporal patterns with wind effects.

These transformations aim to effectively harness the underlying patterns and interactions between features, enhancing predictive power while maintaining robustness to various scale and distribution shifts.

This involves using a mix of scaling, transformation, arithmetic operations, and other feature generating techniques. The goal is to create a richer set of features that capture potential nonlinear relationships and interactions in the data.

Here's a potential improved feature set:

```plaintext

In this feature set:

- Basic transformations (e.g., `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `log`, `sin`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`) are used to standardize and scale the data, making it easier for models to learn from the data.
- Arithmetic operations (e.g., `+`, `*`) create interaction features that might capture interactions between the original features.
- Nonlinear transformations (e.g., `log`, `square`, `cube`, `reciprocal`) address potential nonlinear relationships, providing models with more complex features to learn from.
- Feature engineering using combinations (e.g., `f0 f3 + minmax_scaler`, `f0 f1 * stand_scaler`, etc.) creates new synthetic features that may hold important signals for the prediction task.

2025-11-07 15:22:34,137 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and the operation set, we can create a new feature set that attempts to capture non-linear relationships and interactions in the data. Here, I'll focus on creating combinations with operations that could better uncover complex patterns. The previous examples leverage min-max scaling, standard scaling, and transformations like square, cube, and quantile transformation. Let's use these transformation methods wisely to capture additional insights, but ensure we generate more informative features:

```

```

Here's the breakdown of the feature engineering logic applied:

1. Basic features: Starting by including the original features.
2. Non-linear transformation: Using `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`, `log`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, etc. to transform features to capture non-linear relations.
3. Interaction terms: Created by adding or multiplying pairs or triplets of features (e.g., `f3 f2 + quan_trans`, `f3 f9 + minmax_scaler`).
4. Polynomial terms: Capturing potential non-linear patterns as interactions (e.g., `f3 f3 * f9 f9 * +`).
5. Complex combinations: Using combinations of several transformations and arithmetic to create potentially more informative interactions (e.g., `f0 f1 f2 + + f4 f5 + + /`, `f3 f4 f9 f1 + + + sigmoid`).

This feature set is designed with the intention to enrich the prediction model by leveraging transformations that can introduce non-linearities and capture intricate feature interactions.

### Explanation of the New Features:

- **f2 f3 * sqrt:** This captures interactions between features `f2` and `f3` by multiplying them and applying a square root transformation to handle potential non-linearity.

- **f3 f2 / sigmoid:** Creates a ratio between `f3` and `f2`, soft transformed using a sigmoid function to constrain it between 0 and 1.

- **f10 stand_scaler:** Standard scaling is applied to `f10` to center and scale it, improving model sensitivity.

- **f8 f9 * log minmax_scaler:** Multiplies `f8` and `f9`, followed by a logarithmic transformation, and scales it to range [0,1] for improving model performance by reducing skewness.

- **f1 f10 * reciprocal minmax_scaler:** Interaction feature between `f1` and `f10` is transformed using a reciprocal for possible non-linearity management, followed by min-max scaling.

- **f5 f4 - tanh:** Captures difference between `f5` and `f4` and applies hyperbolic tangent to scale the difference.

- **f3 wind_speed:** This serves as a placeholder where you would include a new feature engineered from domain knowledge of bike sharing, e.g., adjusting demand prediction using wind speed if commonly high wind speeds correlate with reduced bike rentals.

- **f0 f5 / cube stand_scaler:** This explores the interaction of features `f0` and `f5`, cubes the result for capturing non-linearity, and standard scales.

This feature set maintains the original features but extends upon them in meaningful ways to potentially enhance predictive capacity for the model.

1. **Retain Original Features**: Keep the core features (f0, f1, etc.) as is, since they contain valuable information.

2. **Combine Transformations**: Use a variety of transformations, including 'quan_trans', 'minmax_scaler', and others to extract more diverse information from the data.

3. **Feature Interactions**: Introduce interactions or combinations of features to capture non-linear relationships.

4. **Add New Transformations**: Introduce additional transformations that may capture unique aspects of the data (e.g., 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid').

Here is a proposed new feature set:

**Explanation**:
- Additional interactions: `f10 minmax_scaler f3 quan_trans *` combines transformations in a complex interaction.
- Introduced new combinations: `f2 f6 f10 * /` captures interactions among three features.
- New transformations: `f4 tanh`, `f3 sqrt`, `f9 log`, `f11 reciprocal` to capture non-linear relationships and reduce feature skewness.

**Explanation**:

1. **Interaction Features**: Added interaction terms like `f8 f10 *`, which can capture the combined effect of temperature and humidity on bike rentals.

2. **Division and Difference**: Added `f9 f8 /`, `f10 f8 /`, and `f9 f10 -` to capture relationships between factors like humidity, windspeed, and feel_temp.

3. **Summation and Transformation**: Introduced `f3 f2 +` to analyze the combined effect of hour and month, and `f4 f7 sin *` to examine the interaction between holiday indicator and working day transformed with a sine function, which can highlight cyclical patterns.

2025-11-07 15:23:17,995 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, we are looking to generate new features through transformations that could enhance the model's ability to predict bike rental counts. The transformations focus on scaling, nonlinear transformations, and polynomial features. Here is a new set of features that incorporates these ideas:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f5 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal, f9 log, f0 square, f3 square, f8 square, f10 square, f11 square, f8 sin, f10 cos, f3 tanh, f5 sigmoid, f9 quan_trans]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Standard Scaling** (`f1 stand_scaler`, `f2 stand_scaler`): These transformations standardize the `year` and `month` features, which can help the model interpret these features on the same scale.

2. **Reciprocal Transformation** (`f5 reciprocal`, `f7 reciprocal`): This transformation can help linearize relationships for non-normally distributed data like `weekday` and `weather`.

3. **Log Transformation** (`f9 log`): The log transformation is applied to `humidity`, which can help in stabilizing variance and normalizing the feature.

4. **Square Transformation** (`f0 square`, `f3 square`, `f8 square`, `f10 square`, `f11 square`): Polynomial features can capture non-linear relationships in the data. Transforming `season`, `hour`, `temp`, `feel_temp`, and `windspeed` into their squares might reveal such relationships.

5. **Sin Transformation** (`f8 sin`): Seasonal trends can sometimes be periodic. By applying a sine transformation to `temp`, we try to capture any cyclical pattern.

6. **Cos Transformation** (`f10 cos`): Similar to the sine transformation, applying the cosine transformation to `feel_temp` can elicit latent cyclical variations.

7. **Tanh Transformation** (`f3 tanh`): This transformation can help squash extreme values of `hour`, potentially enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between common peak times.

8. **Sigmoid Transformation** (`f5 sigmoid`): The sigmoid function squeezes the transformed `weekday` values into a [0, 1] range, which could help in handling different scales between features.

9. **Quantile Transformer** (`f9 quan_trans`): This transformation on `humidity` can be used to map the data to a uniform distribution for accurate quantile representation.

This new set of features leverages transformation techniques that have the potential to better capture the underlying patterns within the data, thus aiding in improved prediction capability.

This set includes basic features, combinations, and transformations using various mathematical operations and scalers intended to enhance the predictive power of the features.

Feature Set:
```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f6, f8, f9, f10, 
 f3 minmax_scaler, f3 sqrt, f9 log, f7 reciprocal, 
 f3 minmax_scaler f5 /, f3 minmax_scaler f6 tanh,

 f3 minmax_scaler f4 square sigmoid,

```

Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: Retain individual features like `f0`, `f1`, etc., for their intrinsic value.
- **Min-Max Scaling & Standard Scaling**: Applied to make sure data is normalized and comparable.
- **Mathematical Transformations**: Utilize transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, `cube`, and `sin` to capture non-linear relationships and variabilities that simple linear interactions might miss.
- **Combinations and Interactions**: Create interactions between features, especially those with high correlation to the target variable, to capture complex relationships.
- **Reciprocal and Inverse**: Use these transformations for features expected to inversely affect the target.

When integrating these new features, it's crucial to cross-validate and ensure they genuinely contribute to the prediction improvement rather than just adding dimensionality without significant gain.

Explanation of some transformations:
- Used a mix of scaling to capture standardization (`minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`) and non-linear scalings (`sigmoid`, `log`).
- Applied trigonometric and logarithmic functions that can help in capturing periodic behaviors and diminishing returns in features respectively.
- Squaring, cubing, and reciprocal operations can enhance modeling capabilities for relationships between features.
- Using `log` on transformed features can sometimes stabilize variance and normalize skewness.

In this new feature set:
- I included the log of `f9` (humidity) and `f10` (windspeed) for potentially more linear relationships with the target variable.
- I multiplied `f3` (hour) and `f8 reciprocal` to capture any integrated effects of wind speed and time of day.
- I took the square root of `f2` (month) to potentially normalize its effect.
  
These transformations aim to enhance the predictive power of the model by creating new features with potentially stricter adherence to linearity, as well as capturing interactions and nonlinear effects that may exist.

Data Examples:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2025-11-07 15:23:56,408 - INFO - llm output = To create a new and improved feature set based on the examples provided, I will consider using the transformations and combinations of features that might capture more complex relationships within the data. By looking at the second example, we can see the addition of certain transformations like `tanh` and `stand_scaler` on `f1`, which seem to replace less relevant features from the first example.

Here is a proposed new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f8, f9, f10, f8 f3 quan_trans /, f9 f3 quan_trans /, f9 quan_trans f3 quan_trans /, f10 quan_trans f3 quan_trans /, f3 minmax_scaler f3 quan_trans /, f1 cube, f1 f0 -, f1 f2 -, f1 f3 -, f1 f4 -, f1 f5 -, f1 f7 -, f1 f8 -, f1 f9 -, f1 f10 -, f1 f11 -, f10 minmax_scaler, f1 tanh, f1 stand_scaler, f8 f9 *, f8 f10 /, f3 f8 minmax_scaler /]
```

This set includes the base features and leverages more complex feature interactions and scaling. New features have been introduced as product and ratio features to capture potential multiplicative and divisive relationships useful in modeling. Here is a brief explanation:

- Including `f8 f9 *`: This feature multiplication might capture interactions between temperature differences and humidity.
- Including `f8 f10 /`: This feature division might highlight how temperature differences relate to wind speed.
- Including `f3 f8 minmax_scaler /`: After scaling the hour feature, dividing with `f8` might help in understanding the variation of temperature or feeling temperature based on time progression through the day.

These transformations may help improve the prediction of bike rentals by capturing more subtle relationships within the data.

The goal is to create new features that capture non-linear relationships, interactions, and relevant transformations, which might improve the predictive power for the task of predicting total rental bike counts.

Here is an enhanced feature set:

```

**Explanation of New Features:**

1. **(f8 - f11) sqrt**: This feature might capture the interaction effect between humidity and wind speed, scaled in a non-linear space by applying the square root. It might help understand the combined effect of humidity and wind speed variations.

2. **(f9 * f10) log**: This feature is derived from the product of wind speed and the square of temperature, transformed by the logarithm function. This can help in modeling multiplicative effects that grow exponentially.

3. **f1 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling year might help to normalize its impact across the two different years of data, removing bias imposed by different scales.

4. **(f3/f5) tanh**: This captures the interaction between the hour of day and weekday, transformed with the hyperbolic tangent to constrain values between -1 and 1, which might be useful to capture cyclical or periodic patterns. 

These transformations, combined with the base set of features, aim to enrich the feature space, allowing the model to learn complex patterns and interactions effectively.

1. The first example explores interactions between features and transformations like `sin`, `tanh`, and `square`.
2. The second example incorporates powers, min-max scaling followed by squaring, and `cos`.

My goal is to incorporate diversity in transformations, retain useful interactions, and introduce new transformations such as `log`, `sqrt`, and standardized transformations to explore non-linearity and better capture feature distributions.

Here's an improved feature set:

 f11 log, f7 reciprocal, f3 minmax_scaler square, 
 f6 f8 * log, f10 stand_scaler, f9 quan_trans,

```

Explanation of some notable transformations:
- `f0 f1 *` and `f8 f9 *`: Interaction terms that consider joint effect of two features.
- `f10 sqrt` and `f11 log`: Non-linear transformations to deal with skewness.
- `f9 tanh` and `f5 tanh`: Capture non-linear correlations as `tanh` is a squashing function.
- `f3 minmax_scaler square`: Combines scaling with squaring for a consistent range.
- `f10 stand_scaler`: Standardizes the feature to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1.
- `f6 f8 * log`: Involves feature interaction followed by logarithmic transformation to compress scale differences effectively. 

These engineered features aim to capture complex relationships and ensure features are on comparable scales, aiding model learning.

2025-11-07 15:24:58,613 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature engineering examples, the aim is to create new meaningful features that can improve the model's predictive performance. The examples demonstrate transformations like scaling, mathematical functions, and feature interactions. Here is a new feature set suggestion:

```

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Feature Interactions**: Feature interactions like `f8 f3 minmax_scaler /` and `f4 f3 minmax_scaler -` are aimed at capturing complex relationships between related features.
2. **Polynomial Features**: Terms like `f10 square` and `f9 cube` introduce non-linearity which can be beneficial for capturing complex patterns.
3. **Scaling and Transformation**: Use of transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, and `minmax_scaler` help in normalizing the data and managing skewness.
4. **Aggregation and Combination**: Adding or multiplying features (`f6 quan_trans`, `f8 f11 +`, `f1 f3 *`) to capture underlying trends in data, which may help in prediction.

These transformations are consistent with the prior examples and are chosen to improve model performance by providing more expressive and normalized features.

```

### Explanation of New Features:
1. **`f3 minmax_scaler f2 f3 * stand_scaler minmax_scaler -`**: Uses `f2` (month) multiplied by `f3` (hour), scales it, and then applies a series of scalers to normalize and reduce impact of outliers which could capture monthly and hourly interaction effects.

2. **`f3 minmax_scaler f3 f0 + cos stand_scaler minmax_scaler -`**: Captures the cosine of the sum of `f0` (season) and `f3` (hour), providing a periodic transformation that may capture cyclical patterns.

3. **`f3 minmax_scaler f0 f3 + reciprocal quan_trans stand_scaler minmax_scaler -`**: Introduces a non-linear transformation through the reciprocal operation, capturing inverse relationships in season and time of day.

4. **`f1 quan_trans /`**: Applies a quantile transformation to `f1` (year) to standardize and potentially uncover subtle non-linear relationships in how year affects bike rentals.

5. **`f4 sin` and `f5 cos`**: Trigonometric transformations to `f4` (holiday) and `f5` (weekday) to capture potential cyclic variations in these features.

6. **`f5 f6 +`**: Simple addition of `f5` (weekday) and `f6` (workingday) to capture their combined impact.

7. **`f3 minmax_scaler f7 tanh -`**: Applies hyperbolic tangent to `f7` (weather) to scale this categorical feature, potentially capturing extreme conditions in bike rentals.

These transformations aim to capture interactions, periodicity, and non-linearity in the data, which can help improve prediction performance for the total rental bikes.

We will leverage transformations and combinations of existing features that might capture non-linear relationships or scale the features effectively for the model.

Here's a new feature set, drawing inspiration from the examples provided:

### Explanation:

1. **Inclusion of Log Transformation**: `f10 f11 + log` - Adding a log transformation after summing `f10` (humidity) and `f11` (wind speed) could capture multiplicative interactions in a linear form, which might be beneficial if their combined effect is non-linear.

2. **Inclusion of Square Root Transformation**: `f2 f8 * sqrt` - Creating a feature by taking the square root of the product of `f2` (month) and `f8` (temp) can help to address potential non-linear relationships within the data, particularly when these two variables are related in a multiplicative manner.

These transformations are designed to explore non-linear relationships in the data, potentially unveiling patterns that the model might not have captured with the original and simpler transformed features.

The new features should be transformations and combinations of the existing features that may highlight different aspects of the data.

Here's a newly proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f8, f9, f10, f11, 
 f5 f4 /,       # Ratio of holiday effects
 f6 f3 *,       # Product of working day and hour
 f0 f2 *,       # Interaction between season and month
 f8 f10 *,      # Interaction between temperature and humidity
 f3 f8 *,       # Interaction between hour and temperature, can capture rush hour effects corrected by temperature
 f8 tanh,       # Hyperbolic tangent of temperature to handle non-linear effects
 f11 stand_scaler,  # Standard scaling of windspeed for normalization
 f0 f8 /,       # Ratio of season to temperature
 f3 f8 minmax_scaler *, # Interaction between hour and min-max scaled temperature
 f2 f1 stand_scaler /,  # Year-month interaction scaled by year
 f1 cos,        # Cosine transformation of year to capture cyclical nature
 f4 sigmoid]    # Sigmoid transformation of the holiday feature
```

This feature set incorporates various types of transformations, including ratios, interactions, and non-linear transformations (like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `cos`), with a focus on those features most likely to interact in a meaningful way in regard to the expected outcome – the count of rental bikes. These transformations aim to capture cyclical patterns, normalize distributions, and exploit possible non-linear relationships.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Features (f0 to f11):** Original features are always included as they form the fundamental basis of feature engineering.

2. **Square Transformation:** Applied to `f2` (month) as trend or seasonal patterns might exist on a monthly basis.

3. **Reciprocal Transformation:** Used on various features such as `f0` (season), `f3` (hour), `f8` (temp), and `f11` (windspeed) for potential non-linear effects. This can help emphasize smaller values and diminish larger ones.

4. **Standard Scaler:** Applied on `f1` (year) to normalize this feature around its mean, aiding algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

5. **Sum of Two Features:** `f6 f1 +` (weekday + year) provides a combined effect of weekday and time of year which might capture variations throughout different parts of the week and year.

6. **Product of Two Features:** `f2 f8 *` (month * temp) and `f5 f4 *` (weekday * weather) are designed to examine interactions between factors that may collectively influence the rental count.

7. **Division of Two Features:** `f3 f11 /` (hour / windspeed) could reveal the relationship between different times of day and wind conditions.

8. **Logarithmic Transformation:** Applied to `f7` (weather) to reduce the effects of skewness, often useful with ordinal categorical features.

9. **Hyperbolic Tangent (`tanh`) Transformation:** Applied to `f10` (humidity) to squish values and potentially capture non-linear relationships.

This set combines transformations with original features to provide a balanced approach, including interactions and complex transformations. These are crafted to improve model expressiveness and capture more nuances in the data for better predictive performance.

Here's the new feature set:

```

```

**Explanation of New Features:**
- **`f5 f6 * stand_scaler`**: Combining `weekday` and `workingday` since these two features together can give insight into work week dynamics, then standard scaling for normalization.
- **`f8 f9 + log stand_scaler`**: Combining `feel_temp` and `humidity`, which can together indicate comfort level and then applying a logarithm, which can help deal with exponential relationships, followed by standard scaling.
- **`f1 f3 / tanh minmax_scaler`**: The ratio of `year` and `hour` passed through a hyperbolic tangent, which could capture cyclical patterns, and then min-max scaling for normalization.

These additional features can help enhance model performance by capturing deeper interactions and potentially relevant patterns from the data.

### Explanation:

1. **Interactions**: Several interaction terms such as `f3 f6 *`, `f8 f10 *`, and `f5 f9 *` are added. These can capture complex relationships between features such as "hour" and "workingday", "temperature" and "humidity".

2. **Ratio**: Ratios are useful to understand the relative importance or contribution of one feature to another, like `f3 f9 /` to analyze how "hour" relates to "humidity".

3. **Transformation**: Used `f2 minmax_scaler` and `f10 minmax_scaler` to normalize features like "month" and "feel_temp", which can be helpful when using models sensitive to scale.

4. **Non-linear transformations**: Applied functions like cos, tanh, and sin to capture non-linear relationships, e.g., `f4 f8 cos *` can help understand interactions between "holiday" and "temp".

5. **Complex Terms**: Created complex expressions such as `f1 f3 tanh /` to explore potential non-linear relationships between "year" and "hour".

These engineered features aim to capture intricate patterns and relationships in the data to improve the predictive power of the model when predicting the count of total rental bikes.

### Explanation:

1. **Base Features**: Retain all original features for model flexibility.
2. **Log Transformation (`f2 log`)**: Potentially stabilizes variance and normalizes distributions.
3. **Standard and MinMax Scaling (`f3 minmax_scaler`, `f9 stand_scaler`, `f10 stand_scaler`, `f7 minmax_scaler`)**: Standardizes features for consistency across different scales.
4. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - **Tanh and Sqrt (`f0 tanh`, `f1 sqrt`)**: Non-linear transformations can capture complex relationships that linear models might miss.
   - **Cube and Square (`f4 cube`, `f5 square`)**: Amplifies the influence of certain features, which might be predictive when relationships are not linear.
5. **Reciprocal Transformation (`f6 reciprocal`)**: Useful for managing asymmetrical distribution.
6. **Quantile Transformation (`f8 quan_trans`, `f11 quan_trans`)**: Maps data to a uniform distribution.
7. **Feature Interactions (`f3 f6 *`, `f7 f8 +`, `f10 f11 +`)**: Captures potential interactions between features.

These transformations and combinations are crafted to potentially provide new insights into the feature space while preserving interpretability and model performance.

The transformations should aim to uncover underlying patterns, handle non-linear relationships, and potential scaling issues. Based on the examples provided, here is an improved feature set:

```

### Key Changes & Reasoning:

1. **Logarithmic Transformations:** Applying the logarithmic transformation in features like temperature (`f8`) and feel_temp (`f9`) in relation to the hour (`f3`) can help deal with skewness and reveal multiplicative relationships better than the quantile transformations used before.

2. **Scale Adjustments:** Adding standard scaling to features that might have a normal distribution and min-max scaling for features potentially bounded by natural limits (like `f10` and `f7`) assists in normalizing varied range features, improving model convergence.

3. **Non-linear Transformations:** Using both sine and cosine on `f5` (weekday) to encode periodic patterns cyclically, and including the square root transformation to linearize exponentials or stabilizing variance, especially on `f1` and `f2`.

4. **Aggregate Features:** Including aggregated feature creation like addition of multiple terms (`f6 f1 + f2 +`) and complex interactions (`f10 f7 reciprocal * f5 * f9 *`) try to capture interactions among multiple dimensions.

5. **Combination and Full Utilization:** The new feature translates combinations across attributes which covers both linear and non-linear operations that can express complex patterns or interactions unique to the problem context.

This richer feature set should improve the downstream task of predicting bike rentals by leveraging compound transformations and interactions.

2025-11-07 15:26:47,371 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new and potentially improved set of features based on the previous examples, we want to maintain the format specified while applying some transformations and combinations that could capture underlying patterns or interactions in the data. Here's a proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f8, f9, f10, f3 f8 quan_trans /, f9 f8 quan_trans /, f10 f8 quan_trans /, f9 quan_trans f8 quan_trans /, f3 quan_trans f9 quan_trans /, f3 minmax_scaler f8 quan_trans /, f2 minmax_scaler f8 quan_trans /, f7 f1 /, f1 cube, f1 f0 +, f10 f2 -, f1 f3 cos, f4 f3 sin, f1 f5 log, f1 f7 +, f1 f8 tanh, f1 f9 tanh, f1 f10 sigmoid, f1 f11 minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Features**: As in the provided examples, it includes the original features `f0, f1, f2, f3, f8, f9, f10`.

2. **Transformation Features**:
   - `f3 f8 quan_trans /`: Ratio transformations can sometimes capture interactions between features like how two features influence each other.
   - `f9 f8 quan_trans /` and `f10 f8 quan_trans /`: Changing the reference variable to see its relative information.
   - `f9 quan_trans f8 quan_trans /` and `f3 quan_trans f9 quan_trans /`: Applying quantile transformations can help stabilize variance and transform the data in a non-linear manner.

3. **Scaled Features**:
   - `f3 minmax_scaler f8 quan_trans /` and `f2 minmax_scaler f8 quan_trans /`: Scaled features often aid in normalizing dimensions.
   
4. **Composite Features**:
   - `f7 f1 /`: A new ratio that could capture the proportion of two features.
   - `f1 cube`: Cubing often emphasizes the magnitude and may allow more expressive power to capture non-linear relations.
   - `f1 f0 +`: Simple addition of two features to capture their aggregate effect.
   - `f10 f2 -`: Subtracting two features to highlight their difference.

5. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - `f1 f3 cos` and `f4 f3 sin`: Trigonometric transformations can capture cyclical patterns.
   - `f1 f5 log`: Logarithmic transformations often handle skewed distributions well.
   - `f1 f8 tanh` and `f1 f9 tanh`, and `f1 f10 sigmoid`: Using non-linear functions to introduce non-linearity and manage data scaling.
   - `f1 f11 minmax_scaler`: Applying min-max scaling for normalization.

These transformations and features attempt to capture interactions, non-linearities, and normalize the dataset for better prediction performance.

The two provided examples involved operations such as scaling, trigonometric transformations, creating interaction terms, and utilizing polynomial features. Here's a new feature set:

```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Features:** f0 to f6 are included unaltered as basic features.
2. **Trigonometric & Activation Functions:**
   - Applied `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` on features to capture periodic and non-linear transformations.
   - Used features that are likely continuous variables, such as temperature-related and humidity.
3. **Scaling and Polynomial Features:**
   - Used `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to ensure features are on a similar scale and to capture standardized variations.
   - Interaction terms with combinations of features using multiplication to capture leverages between pairs.
   - Cubic transformation on `f10` and `f11` to capture higher-order interactions in windspeed and humidity.
4. **Ratios and Sums:**
   - Used division to create ratios, capturing relative changes between features.
   - Used additions for non-linear compositions and variations among features.
5. **Other Complex Features:**
   - Applied `quan_trans` for quantile transformation on relevant continuous feature(s).
   - Utilized `sqrt` and `sigmoid` transformations combined with additions or ratios to introduce non-linear scaling dynamics.

This new feature set seeks to balance complexity with relevance, introducing several types of transformations that have the potential to uncover hidden patterns and improve model predictions regarding the rental bike counts.

1. Retain original features: [f0, f1, f2, f3, f8, f9, f10] 
2. Introduce some transformed features that could help in capturing non-linear relationships and scale differences:

- f1 stand_scaler: Standard scaling can help machine learning algorithms perform better by normalizing the feature.
- f2 square: Squaring a feature can help capture quadratic relationships.
- f8 reciprocal: Reciprocal transformation can be useful for features that have large ranges or that follow a power law distribution.
- f10 minmax_scaler: Min-max scaling is often useful for normalization.
- f3 recursive log scaling: Using log scaling over already recursively transformed f3 feature
- f9 log: Log transformation is commonly used to reduce skewness and make the data closer to a normal distribution.
- f9 f2 tanh /: Using hyperbolic function along with division to project data space into non-linear dimensions
- f8 f3 reciprocal *: A new feature by taking reciprocal product of temp with month
- f1 f5 -: Difference between year and weekday, temporal feature-based trend pattern

2025-11-07 15:27:25,335 - INFO - llm output = To enhance the feature set for predicting the count of total rental bikes, I'll build on the examples given and introduce some additional transformations that could potentially capture hidden patterns in the data. My objective is to generate a new feature set by transforming the existing features into more informative ones.

Here's an advanced feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, 
 f2 square, f0 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f4 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f11 reciprocal, 
 f1 stand_scaler, f6 f1 +, f1 f6 +,
 f3 f0 *, // interactions between hour and season
 f8 f9 *, // interactions between temperature and feeling temperature
 f4 f8 *, // interactions between holiday and temperature
 f5 sin,  // cyclic nature of weekday captured
 f9 log,  // log transformation to reduce skewness in feeling temperature
 f10 tanh, // nonlinear transformation on humidity
 f4 square, // square transformation to model quadratic effects of holiday
 f3 cos,  // cosine transformation for cyclic hour effect
 f3 f7 *, // interactions between hour and weather
 f0 f11 /, // ratio between season and windspeed
]
```

### Improvements and Feature Explanation:

1. **Interactions (Multiplicative):** Created interaction terms like `f3 f0 *` and `f8 f9 *` to capture the combined effects of different variables like `hour & season` and `temperature & feeling temperature` on the rental counts.
   
2. **Cyclic Transformations:** Used sine and cosine transformations on the `weekday (f5)` and `hour (f3)` to model their cyclic nature.

3. **Log and Tanh Transformations:** Applied `log` transformation on feeling temperature (f9) to handle any positive skewness and `tanh` on humidity (f10) for capturing non-linear relationships.

4. **Quadratic Effect:** Squared `f4`, the `holiday` feature to explore any quadratic effects it might have on rentals.

5. **Ratios:** Derived ratios like `f0 f11 /` to explore the impact of combining `season` and `windspeed`.

These transformations aim to enrich the model's ability to learn and make predictions by uncovering complex patterns and relationships embedded in the original features.

Here’s a new, improved feature set proposal:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f8, f9, f10, f8 f3 quan_trans /, f9 f3 quan_trans /, f9 quan_trans f3 quan_trans /, f10 quan_trans f3 quan_trans /, f3 minmax_scaler f3 quan_trans /, f1 cube, f1 f0 -, f1 f2 -, f1 f3 -, f1 f4 -, f1 f5 -, f1 f7 -, f1 f8 -, f1 f9 -, f1 f10 -, f1 f11 -, f10 minmax_scaler, f1 tanh, f8 f9 *, f10 f11 /, f2 f3 +, f8 f11 log +, f3 f8 *, f9 sqrt, f11 stand_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **f8 f9 *:** This feature multiplies temperature (`f8`) by humidity (`f9`). This interaction could help understand conditions where high temps and high humidity might correlate with fewer rentals.
   
2. **f10 f11 /:** This represents the division of windspeed by itself, which might be redundant, but sometimes scaling can bring insights when combined with other terms.

3. **f2 f3 +:** Adding month (`f2`) and hour (`f3`) might capture some temporal patterns.

4. **f8 f11 log +:** Logarithm of `f8` (temperature) and added to a scaled or standardized version of windspeed (`f11`) could provide an interesting interaction, capturing the conditions of wind with temperature in a non-linear manner.

5. **f3 f8 *:** Multiplying hour (`f3`) and temperature (`f8`) could potentially indicate temperature changes throughout the day, which can affect bike rentals.

6. **f9 sqrt:** Taking the square root of humidity (`f9`) to normalize its distribution.

7. **f11 stand_scaler:** Applying a standard scaler to windspeed (`f11`), normalizing it for improved model performance by keeping it comparable to other rescaled/standardized features.

2025-11-07 15:27:47,640 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, let's consider a combination of both basic arithmetic operations and some advanced transformations. These transformations may include scaling, trigonometric functions, or logarithmic transformations to capture non-linear patterns.

Here's a potential improved feature set:

```

Here's a breakdown of the transformations:

1. **Square Root and Logarithmic Transformation**: More emphasis is given to features prone to non-linear relationships like wind speed and others.
2. **Square and Cube**: Squaring is used to emphasize larger values, while cubing serves to amplify differences especially in temperature and humidity.
3. **Trigonometric Functions**: Used to capture any cyclical patterns in the data such as daily or yearly cycles.
4. **Reciprocal**: To handle the potential inverse relationship between features.
5. **Combinations and Scaling**: Various features are combined and then scaled using different scaling techniques like Min-Max Scaling and Standardization to bring them into a similar range.
6. **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic operations between features to obtain new interaction terms.

These transformations aim to extract complex non-linear relationships from the data, provide better interpretability, and potentially improve model performance.

Keeping this in mind, I'll create a new feature set that aims to capture more complex relationships and transformations to further improve the predictability:

```

```

This feature set aims to capture some combinations that might enhance prediction performance:

- Introducing multiplication of `weekday` and `hour` after scaling can capture patterns related to time of the day and day of the week.
- Division of `workingday` by `year` can create an attribute which relates workdays across years.
- The addition of the square root of `month` with `humidity` can capture seasonal effects combined with weather.

The latter example is considered better, as mentioned. Let's aim to enhance this further.

1. It adds another transformed feature: `f8 minmax_scaler f3 quan_trans /` in addition to the previous transformed features.
2. It removes `f1 stand_scaler` from the transformations, possibly due to redundancy or non-informativeness for prediction.
  
Using these considerations, I'll propose a new feature set:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation of the Additional Feature:
- **`f3 f2 square /`**: This new transformation divides a squared feature by another, potentially capturing non-linear interactions between the hour of the day (`f3`) and month (`f2`). Squaring `f2` could highlight seasonal patterns and non-linear effects more prominently. This feature could provide valuable insights for time-related fluctuations in bike rentals.

2025-11-07 15:28:15,461 - INFO - llm output = To improve the prediction of the total rental bike counts, we can derive new features by employing transformations and combinations of existing features. The aim is to capture underlying patterns and relationships within the data that may enhance the model's understanding.

Based on the examples provided, here is a new feature set that builds upon them while introducing some additional complexity and variety:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f8, f9, f10, f8 f3 quan_trans /, f9 f3 quan_trans /, f10 quan_trans f3 quan_trans /, f3 sqrt f8 /, f11 minmax_scaler, f1 cube, f1 f0 -, f1 f2 -, f1 f3 -, f1 f4 -, f4 f5 /, f1 f7 -, f1 f8 -, f1 log, f10 minmax_scaler, f1 tanh, f1 f11 /, f2 sin, f6 f11 *, f5 sigmoid, f0 f2 -]
```

Here's a breakdown of some of these transformations:

1. **Quantile Transformation and Division:**
   - `f8 f3 quan_trans /` and `f9 f3 quan_trans /` explore interaction effects between features and their quantile transformations.

2. **Square Root Transformation:**
   - `f3 sqrt f8 /` allows for expressing the non-linear relationship between `f3` and `f8`.

3. **Min-Max Scaling:**
   - Applied on `f11`, bringing data into a 0-1 range which can help with models sensitive to input scales.

4. **Cubic and Other Mathematical Transformations:**
   - `f1 cube` captures extreme variations in `f1`.
   - `f1 log` and `f5 sigmoid` help in stabilizing the variance.

5. **Interactions and Differences:**
   - Interactions like `f6 f11 *` capture potential multiplicative effects.
   - Various differences (`f1 f0 -`, `f1 f2 -`) help to explore relative changes.

6. **Trigonometric and Other Nonlinear Transformations:**
   - Using `f2 sin` to model cyclic nature based on angles.
  
This feature set maintains a balance between leveraging transformations applied in provided examples and introducing additional mathematical operations to explore complex patterns that might improve prediction accuracy.

2025-11-07 15:28:29,610 - INFO - llm output = Given the examples you provided, the idea appears to be to generate new features by combining, scaling, and transforming existing ones. Each example seems to aim at creating complex interactions and transformations to capture potential non-linear relationships in the data.

Here's a new feature set that builds upon the complexity and richness of the transformations seen in your examples:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11,

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transformation Functions**: We've added more non-linear transformations (`cube`, `tanh`, `sig`), as they might capture more complex relationships.

2. **Combinations and Scaling**: The use of `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` helps normalize the range of feature values, which can be crucial especially for algorithms sensitive to the scale of data like SVM or neural networks.

3. **Complex Interactions**: Interactions like `f3 minmax_scaler f0 f3 + tanh stand_scaler -` attempt to capture non-linear interactions between features.

4. **Diverse Mathematical Transformations**: Using functions like `reciprocal`, `cos`, and `sin` ensures that the model has a variety of transformations, possibly capturing underlying periodic or inverse relationships.

This feature set attempts to balance complexity with potential utility, allowing downstream models to better capture intricate patterns in the data.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Base Features**: All original features are included to preserve essential information for prediction.
  
- **`f2 square`**: Squaring potentially relevant features like `month` (f2) can help capture nonlinear relationships relating to time-series patterns.

- **Reciprocals**: Using reciprocals of features like `temp` (f0), `humidity` (f2), `wind speed` (f11), etc., can help capture inverse relationships in the data.

- **Standard Scaler & Sum**: Standard scaling `f1` (year) and then using summation with `f6` (working day) could help model how the evolution over the year affects rental behavior.

- **Product of `f8` (temp) and `f9` (feel_temp)**: This captures interactions between actual and perceived temperature, which could affect bike rental demand.

- **Log transform on `f11` (windspeed)**: Useful for dealing with skewed distributions and normalizing the impact of wind speed on bike rentals.

- **Additional Standard Scaler**: `f10 stand_scaler` is added for normalizing `wind speed` to differentiate its impact.

These engineered features should contribute various nonlinear and interactive components that improve the predictive quality of your downstream model.

2025-11-07 15:28:47,788 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets you've provided, the focus seems to be on generating new variables through mathematical transformations and combinations, which can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the original features. To create a feature set that builds on these ideas and potentially improves model prediction capability, consider the following new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f1 cube ,f2 cube ,f3 cube ,f4 cube ,f5 cube ,f9 f8 * ,f10 f9 * ,f11 f10 * ,f0 f1 / ,f2 f3 / ,f4 f5 / ,f6 f7 / ,f0 log ,f8 log ,f10 log ,f2 f3 minmax_scaler / ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f7 f1 minmax_scaler *]
```

**Explanation:**

- Cubes of features (`f1 cube`, ..., `f5 cube`) are included to capture strong non-linear relationships which might be present.
- Interaction features (like `f9 f8 *`, `f10 f9 *`, `f11 f10 *`) create multiplicative relationships that can be powerful in capturing interactions between pairs of features, especially when one feature moderates the effect of another (like humidity and temperature).
- Divided features (`f0 f1 /`, `f2 f3 /`, etc.) can elucidate proportional relationships and might help capture effects per time unit or how one variable changes with respect to another.
- Logarithmic transformations (`f0 log`, `f8 log`, `f10 log`) help in transforming skewed distributions, making them closer to normal, which many modeling techniques assume.
- Min-Max scaling of feature interactions can help standardize these new features into the same range, preventing certain features from dominating the results due to larger ranges. (`f2 f3 minmax_scaler /`, `f6 minmax_scaler`, etc.)

Let's introduce features that can handle non-linear relationships or interactions that may improve the model's predictive power.

Here's a new feature set inspired by the given examples:

```plaintext

```

In this feature set:

- `f3 f8 *`: This feature captures the interaction effect between the hour and temperature, as different hours may amplify or mitigate the effect of temperature on bike rentals.
- `f9 log`: The logarithm transformation for humidity could help in stabilizing variance and providing a better scale for modeling.
- `f10 tanh`: Applying `tanh` to windspeed helps to manage the effect of extreme wind speeds by compressing the feature's range, possibly making the model less sensitive to outliers in windspeed.
- `f10 f2 *`: This feature captures the interaction between windspeed and temperature, as the wind could impact the perceived comfort of temperature throughout the day. 

These transformations are designed to capture non-linear interactions and adjust distributions that might be affecting the predictive power of the model.

2025-11-07 15:29:17,110 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, it's clear that the goal is to create complex feature transformations involving mathematical operations and feature scaling to potentially improve predictions. The second example makes use of various transformation techniques such as `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and `sin`, representing a more sophisticated approach to feature engineering compared to the first example.

Here's a suggested improved feature set based on those examples, incorporating diversified transformations and interactions:

```

 f11 f3 * f1 cube - f2 stand_scaler +,
 f7 f8 max f9 minmax_scaler +,
 f0 f3 * f4 f6 / sin minmax_scaler]
```

Key improvements include:
1. **Combination of Non-linear Transformations:** Usage of operations like `sin`, `log`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, which can help in capturing non-linear patterns.
2. **Feature Interaction Terms:** Multiplication and addition of multiple variables, assuming interactions exist between these features.
3. **Standardization and Scaling:** Extensive use of `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to ensure features are on a comparable scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.
4. **Diverse Mathematical Operations:** Incorporation of operations such as `reciprocal`, `cube`, and `max`, offering a variety of transformations that might unveil hidden patterns in data. 

These engineered features aim to capture complex patterns and interactions in the data, which can potentially improve the model's ability to predict the count of total rental bikes accurately.

2025-11-07 15:29:24,694 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, let's combine aspects from both examples, while also introducing new transformations or combinations that might improve the predictive power. We'll try to include features that capture important relationships and transformations:

```

### Explanation:
- **Base Features**: Retained the original features from both examples, represented as `f0` to `f11`.
- **Division with Quantile Transformation**: Preserved from original examples, features like `f8 f3 quan_trans /` which capture non-linear relationships.
- **Cube and Differences**: Retained the cube transformation for `f1` and differences involving `f1` with other features to capture the impact of the year in different contexts.
- **Standardized and Tanh Transformations**: Added `f9 stand_scaler` and `f8 tanh` to handle variability and non-linearity respectively. 
- **Product of Features**: Introduced `f0 f11 tanh *` to capture potential interaction effects between two impactful features, modulated by the non-linearity of tanh.
- **Logarithmic Transformation**: Added `f2 f10 log +` to reduce skewness and highlight multiplicative relationships.
- **Sigmoid Transformation**: On `f4` to handle binary features and consider logistic growth.
- **Interaction Term**: Introduced `f5 windspeed *` to account for the multiplicative effect of working days and windspeed, possibly capturing varying demand conditions.

Each transformation and combination is aimed at enhancing the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data, making it more capable in predicting the bike rentals effectively.
