you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
