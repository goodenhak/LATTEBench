- This list incorporates a broad range of transformations, including reciprocal, sigmoid, tanh, minmax scaling, and cosine transformations, focusing on potentially informative features.
- The aim is to capture the underlying structure and variations in the data for effective classification.
- The use of square transformations and cosines emphasizes non-linear relationships, while normalization and sigmoids focus on scaling and distribution smoothing.
- Tanh and minmax scaling help in compacting the range of data inputs, particularly beneficial for some model types.

2025-09-27 20:15:43,923 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set by combining transformations and leveraging feature engineering techniques, we can create a new set of features that capture the most informative aspects of the dataset. The key is to utilize a combination of scaling, non-linear transformations, and interactions between features. Here is an improved feature set based on the examples provided:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f6 reciprocal ,f11 reciprocal ,f7 quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans ,f15 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f0 f1 * ,f6 f7 * ,f10 f11 * ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f5 log ,f6 log ,f7 log ,f9 log ,f12 log ,f16 log ,f17 log ,f1 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f11 tanh ,f3 f12 * ,f1 reciprocal f6 reciprocal + f7 reciprocal *]
```

### Explanation:
- **Reciprocal Transformations** (`reciprocal`): Applied to features such as `f0`, `f1`, `f6`, and `f11` to reduce skewness in distributions.
- **Quantile Transformation** (`quan_trans`): Use for `f7` and `f8` to map features to a uniform distribution, which can help with non-linear relationships.
- **Feature Scaling** (`stand_scaler`): Normalize features like `f15` and `f12` to a standard scale (mean=0, variance=1) to improve model convergence.
- **Feature Interactions** (`*`): Create interaction terms like `f0 f1 *`, `f6 f7 *`, and `f10 f11 *` to capture relationships between features.
- **Logarithmic Transformations** (`log`): Applied to features like `f0`, `f1`, `f5`, `f6`, `f7`, `f9`, `f12`, `f16`, and `f17` to handle non-linear relationships or reduce right skewness.
- **Hyperbolic Tangent Transformation** (`tanh`): Use on `f1`, `f6`, and `f11` to compress extreme values and render data more interpretable by reducing the effect of outliers.
- **Combined Interactions and Transformations**: Interaction of reciprocals for features like `f1` and `f6` in combination with the reciprocal of `f7` to explore complex relationships.

These transformations are aimed at enhancing the expressiveness of the feature set and improving the model's ability to capture underlying patterns in the data for better classification.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-27 20:15:58,744 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the provided examples, we will enhance the feature set by using more transformations and interactions that can potentially capture complex relationships and non-linear effects. Here's a proposed set:

```python
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f3 f10 * ,f5 f6 * ,f7 f8 * ,f11 f0 + ,f11 f2 + ,f11 f5 + ,f11 f6 + ,f11 f7 + ,f11 f8 + ,f11 f10 + ,f11 f12 + ,f11 f6 reciprocal + ,f11 f11 reciprocal + ,f11 f7 f7 + f7 f7 + + reciprocal + ,f11 f10 reciprocal reciprocal + ,f11 f11 reciprocal reciprocal + ,f11 f5 reciprocal + ,f11 f12 reciprocal + ,f1 reciprocal ,f5 reciprocal ,f6 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal ,f11 reciprocal ,f12 reciprocal ,f7 f17 + ,f7 reciprocal ,f11 f0 + reciprocal ,f11 f6 + reciprocal ,f11 f5 + f8 + ,f11 f5 + f11 f5 + + ,f11 f12 log ,f3 sqrt ,f7 tanh ,f0 f1 f2 * + ,f3 f5 f6 * + ,f8 f10 f11 * +]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Features**: We maintain the base features (f0, f1, ..., f12) for reference and potential scaling/standardization.
2. **Interactions**: Added interactions like `f3 f10 *`, `f5 f6 *`, and `f7 f8 *` to capture potential multiplicative relationships between features.
3. **Existing Interactions & Transformations**: Preserved useful existing interactions and transformations that were in both examples.
4. **Additional Transformations**: Included transformations such as `f11 f12 log` and `f3 sqrt` to explore non-linear effects.
5. **Hyperbolic and Complex Transformations**: Added `f7 tanh` to model possible hyperbolic behavior, and interactions like `f0 f1 f2 * +` for capturing higher-order interactions.

This new set aims to provide a diverse range of features deriving both linear and non-linear relationships, which might enhance the classification performance when being used for model training.

To create an even better feature set, we can refine this approach by incorporating additional non-linear transformations and by combining multiple transformations on certain features.

Here is a refined feature set:

```

### Explanation:
1. **Non-linear Transformations**: Applied `square`, `sin`, `cos`, `log`, and `sqrt` to different features to capture non-linear patterns.
2. **Combination of Transformations**: Combined operations like `stand_scaler tanh` for stacking transformations to exploit complex data distributions.
3. **Diverse Transformations**: Increased the diversity of transformations on features to help the model capture various relationships.

This refined feature set aims to enhance the ability of a predictive model to identify complex patterns within the dataset, potentially improving classification performance.

Answer: 3

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-27 20:16:24,348 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature transformations and examples, we aim to create a feature set that is likely to improve the predictive performance effectively by considering a balance of raw, scaled, and transformed features. Here is a new feature set that combines some of the strategies from the examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f5 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f11 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f6 tanh reciprocal, f8 tanh reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f3 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f2 f7 *, f2 f11 *, f2 f8 * f6 +, f8 f5 *, f1 f2 * reciprocal]
```

This feature set includes:
- Selected original features to keep baseline information.
- Reciprocal transformations for inversely varying features.
- Tanh reciprocal for non-linear scaling adjustments.
- Stand_scaler to normalize certain features.
- Combined features using multiplication to capture interactions.
- An additional combined transformation `f2 f8 * f6 +` to introduce more complexity.

2025-09-27 20:16:33,410 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the examples provided, let's incorporate a combination of operations and interactions that utilize the strengths from both existing feature sets and possibly introduce new transformations that could enhance predictive performance. We should focus on incorporating different types of transformations such as non-linear transformations, interactions, and reciprocals to potentially capture non-linear patterns in the data. Here's a proposed feature set:

``` 
[f2, f3, f5, f7, f8, f10, f11, f12, f7 f7 + , f11 f0 + tanh, f11 f1 + sqrt, f11 f2 + reciprocal, f11 f5 + square, f11 f6 + reciprocal, f11 f8 +, f11 f10 + cos, f11 f12 + tanh, f11 f6 reciprocal + log, f11 f7 f7 + f7 reciprocal + square, f5 reciprocal, f6 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f11 reciprocal, f12 reciprocal, f8 f8 + f8 reciprocal +, f11 f0 + log, f11 f5 + cos, f11 f7 + f7 f7 + cos, f11 f7 + reciprocal, f11 f5 + tanh, f11 f5 + f11 f5 + + sqrt]
```

This feature set uses combinations of existing features and introduces various mathematical transformations like `sqrt`, `square`, `cos`, `tanh`, `log`, and `reciprocal` to capture different types of relationships within the data. These transformations and interactions are designed to explore potentially non-linear patterns that may help improve classification performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Differentiating features such as `f2 f11 -` and `f6 f11 -` to capture relative differences.
- Combinations involving transformations like `tanh` and `sin` (`f6 tanh f7 sin -`) that can capture more specific interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-27 20:16:50,556 - INFO - llm output = Here's a better feature set combining and improving upon the previous two examples. The aim in constructing this feature set is to enhance interpretability and potential predictive power by exploring interactions and transformations:

```plaintext

```

In this set:
- Combination transformations like `f7 f1 * f2 + f7 *` and `f7 f9 * f13 + reciprocal` aim to explore interactions of features that might reveal latent dimensions or features characteristic of certain vehicle types.
- Logarithm and reciprocal transformations help handle skewness and normalize ranges which can be beneficial in classifiers sensitive to data distributions.
- The use of hyperbolic tangent (tanh) and squares are meant to add non-linearity into the feature space, providing opportunities to capture more complex relationships that might be present in the data.
- We incorporate sums and transformations across different features like `f14 log f15 log +` to explore their combined effect, offering richer, potentially more discriminative features.

Key additions and combinations:
- Included both `f7 reciprocal cos` and `f7 sigmoid` for capturing non-linear relationships.
- Added `f7 cube` and combined cube with the original feature `f14` multiplied by `f7` for interaction effects.
- Utilized `quan_trans` and `tanh` transformations for more features to enhance feature distribution adherence to normality.
- Kept the stand_scaler and minmax_scaler for normalization and scaling of select features. 

This feature set combines elements from both given examples, emphasizing a mix of linear and non-linear transformations, interactions, and scaling to potentially enhance the predictive power of the dataset.

2025-09-27 20:17:16,645 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set, it's important to consider combinations that capture non-linear relationships and interactions, while also potentially reducing dimensionality or improving interpretability. For effective feature engineering in this context, I'll combine elements from both given sets and introduce some transformations that could enhance predictive performance:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17,

 f7 f8 + f7 f5 + , f3 f4 reciprocal + f14 f15 + ,
 f13 f17 + f7 f15 + f7 f16 + ]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Combination of Features**: Similar features are multiplied together to capture interaction effects (e.g., `f0 f1 *`, `f2 f3 *`).
2. **Higher-Order and Non-linear Transformations**: Non-linear transformations such as `cube`, `tanh`, and `sqrt` are applied where interactions suggest potential curvature (e.g., `f0 f7 + tanh`, `f9 f3 * f6 reciprocal reciprocal * sqrt`).
3. **Reduction of Dimensionality through Reciprocals and Quantile Transformations**: Features such as `f1 reciprocal` and `f7 quan_trans` can normalize scale or skewness.
4. **Combining Linearly Related Features**: Adding features that could contribute linearly can help catch additional unforeseen interactions (e.g., `f7 f8 + f7 f5 +`).
5. **Incorporation of Significant Feature Interactions**: Incorporate sums and variations from existing configurations to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential patterns (`f9 f3 * f10 f11 * +`).

With these transformations, the new feature set seeks to exploit the combinations and transformations that might lead to improved model performance for this classification task.

This feature set combines effective non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, and `reciprocal`, which can capture complex relationships within the data, with scaling and quantile transformations to maintain consistent feature ranges and distributions. The use of both `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` helps in normalizing the range and distribution of features for improved model performance.

We aim to create a diverse yet concise list of features that might improve model performance for the classification task. Here is the new feature set:

```

```

This feature set retains the original features and integrates a combination of existing transformations and newly proposed transformations:

- Feature treatments like `log`, `reciprocal`, `cube`, `sqrt`, `cos`, `sin`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` are retained or added for capturing non-linear relationships.
- Interactions like `f6 f7 *` and `f1 f3 +` exploit multiplicative and additive relationships.
- Differences and ratios such as `f6 f11 -` and `f11 f8 /` can highlight contrasts and proportions.
- Nonlinear transformations applied to combination features like `f8 cube sqrt` to induce non-trivial changes possibly useful for classification.

The adjustments are made with the aim of enhancing the model's ability to discern nuanced patterns and further differentiate among vehicle types.

Let's maintain the focus on extracting non-linear patterns and preserving relationships between the features:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:

1. **Original and Simple Derived Features**: Keep the original features (`f0` to `f17`) for linear models and baseline comparisons.
  
2. **Combinations of Features and Basic Mathematical Operations**: 
   - Combine features with subtraction and multiplication to capture interaction effects (e.g., `f2 f11 -` and `f14 f7 *`).
   - Use more complex arithmetic like division to enhance the relationships (e.g., `f4 f11 tanh /`).

3. **Non-linear Transformations**: 
   - Use non-linear transformations like `cube`, `tanh`, and `sqrt` to capture non-linear patterns in the data (e.g., `f7 cube`, `f14 sqrt`).

4. **Standardization and Scaling**:
   - Apply `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for normalized feature representations (e.g., `f15 stand_scaler`, `f11 minmax_scaler`).
  
5. **Quantile Transformations**:
   - Apply `quan_trans` for non-linear scaling based on distribution (e.g., `f0 quan_trans`, `f4 quan_trans`).

6. **Logarithmic Transformation**: 
   - Use logarithmic transformation for features that may have exponential growth patterns (e.g., `f5 log`).

By including a variety of transformations and interactions, this feature set aims to effectively capture complex patterns and improve model performance for the downstream task of vehicle silhouette classification.

The latter example uses more interactions and transformations with reciprocal features, which can help in capturing inverse relationships.

Here's a proposed better feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f12 f0 + ,f12 f1 + ,f12 f3 + ,f12 f5 + ,f12 f6 + ,f12 f9 + ,f12 f10 + ,f12 f11 + ,f0 f11 recipocal / ,f1 f11 recipocal / ,f2 f11 recipocal / ,f3 f11 recipocal / ,f12 f12 reciprocal + ,f11 f0 reciprocal + ,f11 f2 reciprocal + ,f11 f5 reciprocal reciprocal + ,f11 f6 reciprocal reciprocal + ,f11 f7 f7 + f7 f7 + + reciprocal reciprocal +]
```

This set introduces:

- More interactions using addition and division with `f12`, which seems effective in capturing complex interactions in the latter example.
- Continuing to exploit the reciprocal operation within interactions to potentially capture inverse relationships.

Answer: 3

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Below is a new feature set proposal:

``` 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f11 f11 tanh - cube square, f7 reciprocal, f2 f3 * sqrt, f0 f4 / log, f5 f10 + minmax_scaler, f1 f12 - stand_scaler, f6 tanh, f9 sigmoid, f13 f16 sinh, f14 f17 cos, f15 reciprocal cube]
```

Explanation of new features:
- `f2 f3 * sqrt`: Compute the square root of the product of `f2` and `f3`. Multiplicative interaction terms captured through roots can model non-linear relationships.
- `f0 f4 / log`: This transformation assesses the ratio between `f0` and `f4`, and takes the log, potentially normalizing skewed distributions.
- `f5 f10 + minmax_scaler`: Addition of `f5` and `f10`, scaled between 0 and 1 to normalize the data.
- `f1 f12 - stand_scaler`: Difference between `f1` and `f12`, standardized to have mean 0 and variance 1, providing scaled difference features.
- `f6 tanh`: Tanh applied to `f6` for nonlinear scaling.
- `f9 sigmoid`: Sigmoid applied to `f9` for another method of nonlinear scaling.
- `f13 f16 sinh`: Hyperbolic sine of `f13` and `f16` to introduce a non-linear interaction with potential benefit for modeling curvature.
- `f14 f17 cos`: Cosine of a combination of `f14` and `f17`, capturing cyclical relationships.
- `f15 reciprocal cube`: Reciprocal and cube transformations on `f15` allow modeling inverse relationships and emphasize larger magnitude values.

This feature set continues to build complexity and interaction while remaining concise.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f7 cube ,f2 f11 - ,f6 f11 / ,f1 f10 * ,f15 stand_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f0 quan_trans ,f5 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans ,f14 quan_trans ,f16 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f6 tanh f5 * ,f9 sqrt f3 / ,f7 sin f13 + ,f10 reciprocal ,f11 reciprocal ,f4 square f15 / ,f6 tanh f11 /]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Features**: Include the basic features (f0, f1, ..., f17) to maintain the original information.
2. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - Cubing the f7 feature (f7 cube) may capture more complex relationships in the variance along the minor axis.
   - Use `tanh`, `sin`, `reciprocal`, and `sqrt` to introduce non-linearity in interactions and to capture subtle variations.
3. **Feature Interactions**:
   - Create differences and ratios of certain features to find new patterns (`f2 f11 -`, `f6 f11 /`, etc.).
   - Multiply specific features that may have related effects (`f1 f10 *`).
4. **Quantitative Transformations**:
   - Apply `quantile transformation` (quan_trans) on selected features to normalize their distribution.
   - Use `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for standardizing and scaling features to be robust to outliers.
5. **Complex Interactions**:
   - Combine multiple transformations (`f6 tanh f5 *`, `f4 square f15 /`) to explore interactions that could be indicative of specific vehicle types.

By creating this mix of transformed and original features, this feature set aims to exploit both the relationships among different features and the distributional properties of individual features, potentially improving the classification model's performance.

Here's a proposed feature set, combining ideas from the two initial examples and introducing some new combinations:

```plaintext

```

Explanation:
1. Retain base features ensuring the original feature space is available.
2. Apply non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cos` to capture complex relationships.
3. Create interaction terms between features (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to explore joint influence beyond individual features.
4. Use transformations like `reciprocal`, `sin`, and `sqrt` combined with feature interactions to introduce further non-linearity.
5. Ensure a diverse mixture of simple and complex interactions to enhance the eventual model's predictive capabilities. 

This feature set extracts additional insights while maintaining computational feasibility.

2025-09-27 20:18:06,052 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, the aim is to create a better feature set by transforming the original features and combining them in meaningful ways. The latter example, which is considered better, includes fewer redundant transformations and places a greater emphasis on combining features through basic arithmetic operations. To create a superior feature set, we should strive for minimal complexity while retaining potentially useful data interactions. 

Here is a proposed better feature set:

```plaintext

### Explanation:
- We retained the original features (`f0` to `f17`) since they are foundational features for the downstream task.
- We kept `f11 f11 tanh - cube square` and `f7 reciprocal`, as they are from the previous feature set.
- Introduced `f6 f8 + cube` to capture a nonlinear interaction between these features and increase feature space dimensionality.
- Added `f10 f9 * sqrt`, which utilizes a combination of `f10` and `f9` in a multiplicative interaction, and then applies a nonlinear transformation for further variability.
- Used `f3 f4 - square` to explore potential quadratic relationships within the data.
- Applied a `minmax_scaler` to `f5` to normalize it and potentially highlight its contrast in the presence of other features.
- Applied `quan_trans` on `f2` to normalize its distribution, capturing unique distribution aspects.
- Added `f13 reciprocal` to capture inverse relationships that might be inversely informative for classification.

This feature set leverages diverse transformations and statistical ideas to enhance the expressiveness and predictive power for the classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-27 20:18:16,371 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two given examples, we need to focus on incorporating meaningful transformations and combinations of features that could potentially capture complex relationships within the data. The latter feature set example utilizes all the original features and includes some diverse transformations like the cube function, multiplication, the minmax scaler, stand scaler, and quantile transformation for various features. We'll build on this second example, retaining the comprehensive use of features and transformations while integrating more complex interactions and transformations to enhance the feature set.

Here's the improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17,

 f14 f11 -, f16 f15 + f5 -, 
 f12 * f15 -, f2 f9 + f16 * f7 /]
```

This set builds on the previous example by incorporating more interactions and transformations across different features. The use of mathematical operations and transformations aims to uncover non-linear relationships and interactions that might improve the model's predictive power for vehicle classification.

A more sophisticated approach often involves using a variety of transformations that might capture different aspects of the data.

Here's a new set of transformed features:

```

 f11 log, f6 f6 square - sqrt, f8 minmax_scaler, f15 cube, 
 f7 reciprocal, f4 f2 + f1 - tanh]
```

This new feature set includes:

- Utilization of `log`, `sqrt`, `minmax_scaler`, and `cube` transformations for different features to address potential nonlinear relationships, rescale the features, and handle large spread of values.
- Application of a combination of basic arithmetic operations followed by `tanh`, which helps in normalizing and potentially capturing important feature interactions.
- Emphasis on the feature `f7` (ELONGATEDNESS), which already proved useful in previous transformations (reciprocal).

Explanation of some transformations:
- **`f7 reciprocal`**: Captures the inverse relationship of feature f7, potentially highlighting subtle inversely proportional relationships.
- **`f14 f7 * minmax_scaler`**: Multiplying features and normalizing them using min-max scaling for better numerical stability.
- **`f11 f11 tanh - cube square`**: A combination of transformations on f11 to capture complex interactions and higher-order representations.
- **`f15 log`**: Log transformation to reduce skewness and handle exponential growth patterns.
- **`f3 f12 * tanh`**: Interaction between features f3 and f12 followed by a hyperbolic tangent for nonlinear scaling.
- **`f0 f1 + tanh`**: Summing f0 and f1 to capture additive relationships, then applying tanh for nonlinear effects.
- **`f2 f6 * sqrt`**: Multiplying and then taking the square root, useful for adjusting scale and handling disproportional effects.
- **`f8 stand_scaler`**, **`f10 stand_scaler`**: Standardizing features for enhanced stability and interpretation.

This feature set aims to capture a broad range of complex interactions and scales to improve the performance of downstream classification tasks.

Answer: 3

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This set combines elements from both previous examples by keeping a variety of transformations, including trigonometric (cosine) and hyperbolic (tanh, sigmoid) functions, scaling (minmax and standard), quantile transformations, and combining operations like multiplication and reciprocal. It includes a balance of non-linear transformations and scaling techniques, which can be helpful in capturing different patterns in the data for the classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Below is a proposed improved feature set that leverages and augments both quantile transformations and cubic transformations, in addition to exploring other transformations like square, sqrt, and reciprocal for certain features:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f7 cube ,f14 f7 * ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f15 stand_scaler ,f0 quan_trans ,f1 quan_trans ,f2 quan_trans ,f3 quan_trans ,f4 quan_trans ,f5 quan_trans ,f6 quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans ,f9 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans ,f12 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f16 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f14 cube ,f0 sqrt ,f1 square ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 log ,f14 sqrt]
```

- Added transformations like `sqrt`, `square`, `reciprocal`, and `log` to various features to explore different forms of scaling and transformation, which may help with nonlinearity or skewed distributions.
- Retained the `cube` transformation and multiplication of certain features for potential interaction effects.
- Quantile transformation of most original features is preserved to maintain robust scaling across distributions.

This enhances the capacity to capture various relationships and patterns in the data, potentially improving model prediction performance.

Answer: 3

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-27 20:18:43,686 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, the approach for improving the feature set focuses on enriching the transformations applied to the original features, using a variety of mathematical functions and scalers. The second example utilizes more complex transformations and scaling methods such as `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `quan_trans`, which can help in better normalization and capturing non-linear relationships in the data. Additionally, operations like `cube` and multiplication offer feature interaction which can potentially unveil intricate patterns.

Here's a proposed improved feature set combining ideas from the given examples:

```

This enhanced feature set introduces `sqrt` to f9, `log` to f5, and `reciprocal` to f6, focusing not only on scalability but also on transformations that assist in linearization and variance stabilization. These transformations can improve model interpretability and predictive performance by uncovering hidden structures within the data.

In this new set:

- I've retained the original features that have proven useful, such as `f0` to `f12`.
- A few additional original features `f13` and `f16` have been included, potentially carried over from the latter example, for expanding feature space.
- I've reused several combined or inverted features, reflecting relationships captured in the examples.
- New transformations and interactions are added, such as `f3 f8 tanh +`, `f2 f1 /`, `f10 f6 * f11 /`, `f7 f5 * log`, `f6 square`, `f8 cos`, and `f5 sin`, which help capture non-linear and interaction effects among the features.
- The usage of functions such as `tanh`, `log`, `square`, `cos`, and `sin` can help in exploring potential non-linear relationships which might be beneficial for a classification task.

2025-09-27 20:18:55,735 - INFO - llm output = Given the two provided feature set transformations, the goal is to create an even more informative feature set for improving the classification of vehicle types. To achieve this, we will retain effective transformations from both examples and introduce additional transformations that could further enhance feature variability and assist in distinguishing between the classes.

Here is the crafted feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f7 reciprocal cos ,f7 sigmoid ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f4 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f11 tanh ,f12 tanh ,f13 tanh ,f16 tanh ,f17 tanh ,f1 reciprocal ,f5 reciprocal ,f6 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal ,f11 reciprocal ,f12 reciprocal ,f8 sigmoid ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f13 log ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f2 reciprocal]
```

Explanation of changes:
1. **Retention and Combination**: Key transformations from both examples that seemed beneficial were retained and combined, such as the reciprocal transformations and `sigmoid`/`tanh` transformations.
2. **Inclusion of New Transformations**:
   - **Square Root (`sqrt`)**: Applied to `f4`, `f5`, and `f9` to introduce a nonlinear scale, which can help to normalize the data's distribution and reduce skewness.
   - **Logarithm (`log`)**: Applied to `f13` as it's a common feature transformation for reducing skewness, especially for features with wide ranges like `SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS`.
   - **Min-Max Scaling (`minmax_scaler`)**: Applied to `f3` to bring another feature into a normalized range between 0 and 1, which could help certain algorithms that assume data on a comparable scale.
   - **Reciprocal (`reciprocal`)**: Added additional variation by including reciprocal of `f2` for further nonlinear distortion and stabilization of feature distributions.

These transformations can provide a better representation of the vehicle dataset, potentially improving the classification results by capturing latent patterns and reducing dimensionality effects.

```

Here's a breakdown of the additional transformations:
- `f2 minmax_scaler`, `f3 stand_scaler`: Adding scaling transformations to features f2 and f3 to aid in normalization.
- `f14 log`: Applying log transformation to f14 to handle any skewness in distribution.
- `f15 cube`: Using a cube transformation on f15 to capture non-linear relationships.
- `f7 square`, `f9 square`: Squaring features f7 and f9 to emphasize their larger values, which could capture variance more explicitly.

These transformations are chosen to transform and standardize the data further, allowing a model to potentially learn better from underlying patterns.

Explanation:
- I've included the original features `f0` to `f17` as they represent the base dimensions of the dataset.
- Added `f13 f10 sqrt /`: This feature divides `f13` by the square root of `f10`, capturing a relationship between skewness and scaled variance.
- Added `f7 tanh square`: Applying the hyperbolic tangent followed by squaring on `f7` (ELONGATEDNESS) to possibly capture nonlinear interactions related to this feature.

```

### Explanation:
- Original features `f0` to `f17` are retained to ensure baseline data is present.
- Feature transformations like `cube`, `reciprocal`, `sin`, `log`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `quan_trans` are applied for potential normalization, scaling, and distribution fitting.
- Combination techniques using operations like `*` (multiplication), `+` (addition) are also included to explore interactions between features.
- Diverse transformations such as `f6 reciprocal` or `f4 log` are introduced to handle feature distributions and highlight different data characteristics potentially beneficial for classification.

These transformations should help highlight the complex non-linear relationships among the features and potentially improve prediction accuracy in the downstream vehicle classification task.

2025-09-27 20:19:35,899 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature set examples, we will aim to improve the feature set by utilizing a diverse set of feature transformation techniques and selecting the most informative features. Here is a new feature set that incorporates ideas from both example transformations:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f16, f17, 
f7 reciprocal cos, f7 sigmoid, 
f0 tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f12 tanh, f13 tanh, f16 tanh, 
f10 log, f11 log, f12 log, 
f7 cube, f14 f7 *, 
f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f11 quan_trans, f12 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f16 quan_trans, f17 quan_trans]
```

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Feature Diversity:** By incorporating log transformations of several features, we handle potential skewness and achieve better distribution normalization.
2. **Advanced Feature Interactions:** Kept f7 cube and f14 f7 * from the first feature set because interactions between significant features could capture complexities in the data.
3. **Transformation Techniques:** Combined tanh transformations from the second feature set with quantile transformations from the first to stabilize variance and treat outliers efficiently.
4. **Reciprocal Transformations:** Included reciprocal and cosine combinations for features already showing potential from the second example to capture non-linear relationships and periodic behaviors.

This new feature set attempts to leverage the strengths of both previous examples while introducing new transformations to better capture underlying patterns in the data for the classification task.

Explanation:
I retained the form of the previously provided new feature sets and added potential transformations using existing operations:

1. `f11 f12 * sqrt`: New feature created by taking the square root of the product of features f11 and f12.
2. `f0 f1 f3 + * log`: Log of the product of feature f0 and the sum of features f1 and f3.
3. `f7 f7 * f6 / f5 + minmax_scaler`: Min-max scaling of a feature constructed by multiplying f7 with itself, dividing by f6, and adding to f5.
4. `f3 f2 f5 / + f6 tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent transformation of a feature made by dividing f3 by f2 and f5, then adding f6.
