```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f7 tanh, f8 square, f9 sqrt, f16 f0 *, f16 f1 *, f16 f2 *, f16 f3 *, f16 f4 *, f16 f5 *, f16 f8 *, f16 f9 *, f16 f10 *, f16 f11 *, f16 f12 *, f16 f13 *, f16 f14 *, f16 f15 *, f16 f17 *, f16 f18 *, f16 f19 *, f16 f20 *, f7 f9 /, f5 f8 *, f3 f12 /]
```

Explanation of the modifications:
- Addition of `f7 f9 /` for capturing potential interaction effects between `Halstead's time estimator` and `difficulty`.
- Addition of `f5 f8 *` for coupling `volume` and `intelligence`, which might capture compound effects of complexity and aptitude in code.
- Addition of `f3 f12 /` to generate a feature reflecting a ratio between `design complexity` and `count of lines of comments`.
- Kept `tanh` and `sqrt` transformations as they help in non-linearly scaling features, which can handle skewness and improve model learning.
- Kept multiplication-based interactions with `f16`, as they add context-specific magnitude transformations to features.

This feature set harnesses mathematical transformations and complex interactions, aiming for greater predictive information with additional context beyond simple linear relationships.

Explanation:

1. **`f5 log`**: Applying a logarithmic transformation on feature `f5` can help normalize skewed data and potentially highlight meaningful patterns, especially if `f5` represents a metric like volume or effort which may inherently have a wide range.

2. **`f4 f3 * stand_scaler`**: By multiplying features `f4` and `f3`, we create a new interaction term that can capture joint variability or relationships between these features. Scaling this interaction using a standard scaler normalizes it for better integration into the model, making it more comparable across samples.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-11 22:38:43,137 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations, the aim is to generate a new feature set that leverages transformations for improved predictive quality while maintaining the postfix format. Here is a new feature set that combines the strengths of the previous two examples and introduces new transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f1 minmax_scaler sigmoid ,f6 f7 * ,f6 f0 * f1 sqrt / ,f6 f2 * f3 sqrt / ,f6 f4 * f5 sqrt / ,f6 f8 * f9 sqrt / ,f6 f10 * f11 sqrt / ,f6 f12 * f13 sqrt / ,f6 f14 * f15 sqrt / ,f6 f17 * f18 sqrt / ,f6 f19 * f20 sqrt / ,f16 cos reciprocal , f7 log , f8 log , f9 log , f10 log]
```

**Explanation:**
- **f1 minmax_scaler sigmoid**: Utilizes scaling followed by a non-linear transformation to enhance feature representation.
- **f6 f7 ***: Combines two features by multiplication, indicating interaction effects.
- **f6 f0 * f1 sqrt /** through **f6 f19 * f20 sqrt /**: Creates interaction terms of features and scales them by taking square roots which can reduce the impact of extreme values but still reflect the effect.
- **f16 cos reciprocal**: Combines cosine transformation with reciprocal to capture cyclic patterns and relationships in the data.
- **f7 log** through **f10 log**: Log transformation helps to address skewness in the data and normalize variance.

This set of transformations is designed to capture potential interactions, normalize features, and manage non-linear effects, leading to improved model performance for software defect prediction.

We want to leverage complex interactions and transformations like tanh, reciprocal, and quantile transformations, which might capture underlying patterns better. Here's a new feature set that tries to incorporate these ideas:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, 
 f7 tanh, f16 f0 *, f16 f1 *, f16 f2 *, f16 f3 *, f16 f4 *, f16 f5 *, f16 f8 *, f16 f9 *, f16 f10 *, 
 f16 f11 *, f16 f12 *, f16 f13 *, f16 f14 *, f16 f15 *, f16 f17 *, f16 f18 *, f16 f19 *, f16 f20 *, 
 f7 quan_trans, f16 tanh, f16 reciprocal, f16 quan_trans, 
 f8 f9 *, f4 f5 *, f18 f19 *, f0 log, f5 log, f10 log, f15 log, f9 reciprocal, f7 cube, f3 cube]
```

In this new feature set, we've added interactions between significant features like `f8 f9 *`, `f4 f5 *`, and `f18 f19 *`, as well as logarithmic transformations and higher-degree polynomials which can help in capturing non-linear relationships. The original feature mix is retained while introducing complex interactions to potentially improve the prediction model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-11 22:39:18,672 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature set examples, we will create a new feature set that aims to be more effective by incorporating and combining some transformations from both examples while introducing additional transformations which might aid in predictive power.

Here is the improved feature set:

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f19 cos ,f6 sigmoid ,f7 stand_scaler ,f5 square reciprocal ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f5 square ,f9 square ,f10 square ,f7 minmax_scaler tanh ,f16 sin ,f20 cube ,f16 log]

In this improved feature set:

1. Common transformations like *square*, *cos*, and *sigmoid* are maintained due to their prevalence in both examples and their potential in non-linear adjustments.
2. The usage of *reciprocal* on the square of f5 captures a different aspect of non-linearity and numerical stability.
3. The transformation *tanh* applied after *minmax_scaler* on f7 could help compress the range of this feature into a normalized space while highlighting its important traits.
4. New operation introduced: *cube* is applied to f20 to capture additional complexity, and *log*, which can help compress large values of f16 into a more manageable scale that might highlight trends or anomalies differently.

These transformations aim to strike a balance between non-linear transformations and scaling methods to improve the model's ability to detect patterns related to software defects effectively.

f16 tanh, 
f0 sin f0 reciprocal /, 
f4 square f5 square + minmax_scaler sigmoid, 
f10 log, 
f6 sqrt f7 sqrt +, 
f8 cube]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Original Features**: We keep all the original features as they contain the primary information.

2. **Sigmoid Transformations**: Sigmoid is applied to a selection of features potentially to normalize them and create additional nonlinear relationships.

3. **Tanh Transformation**: Retaining the `f16 tanh` transformation from the second set.

4. **Trigonometric and Inverse Operations**: `f0 sin f0 reciprocal /` provides a unique transformation that combines trigonometric sine with an inverse, capturing periodic behavior potentially.

5. **Combination and Scaling**: The expression `f4 square f5 square + minmax_scaler sigmoid` combines square transformations followed by scaling and sigmoid, which can help in compressing the range and emphasizing interactions.

6. **Log Transformation**: Applying a logarithmic transformation to `f10` can handle skewness and improve model sensitivity to ratios rather than differences.

7. **Square Root Addition**: Combining the square root of `f6` and `f7` can highlight intermediate-scale interactions between these two features.

8. **Cube Transformation**: Applying a cube to `f8` could emphasize large values and introduce non-linear interactions.

By carefully selecting transformations that capture non-linear patterns and interactions, this new feature set aims to enhance predictive power for the software defect prediction task.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

**Explanation:**
- Maintained existing transformations that are potentially helpful, such as `f10 log`, `f8 cube`, and `f0 sigmoid`.
- Retained `f17 cos` for potential relevance, as it is part of the second set.
- Combined features using operations seen in both sets to create interactions, such as `f7 f6 +`, but further expanded using squares.
- Considered advanced feature interaction `f17 cos f7 f6 + square /`, leveraging trigonometric and algebraic transformations for potentially capturing complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

In this enhanced feature set, I added the transformation `f0 f12 * sqrt`, which combines features 0 and 12 by multiplying them and applying the square root. This aims to capture potential nonlinear interactions between these two features, potentially improving predictive power in the context of identifying software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this example, additional transformations like `f4 f5 * log` and `f10 f11 * square` have been added to potentially capture more complex interactions and non-linear effects that could be useful for defect prediction while maintaining the format and transformational variety.

```

In this set, we've included:

1. **Cubed Transformations with Tanh:** Apply cube followed by tanh to all original features to capture non-linear and complex interactions.
2. **Reciprocal with Logarithm:** Use reciprocal transformed features with logarithm for stability and intuition from mathematical properties.
3. **Interaction terms with Tanh:** Introduce multiplicative interactions between selected features followed by tanh to capture dependencies and interactions better.
4. **Use of Square Root:** For smoothing the features, apply square root on a few selected features.

This approach should enhance the capture of complex patterns and relationships potentially present in the dataset, improving prediction accuracy in downstream tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2025-09-11 22:41:11,627 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature set examples, the goal is to enhance and create a better feature set. Here's a new feature set that incorporates valuable transformations while trying to create potentially more predictive features:

```

```

### Explanation:
- The provided transformations like `sigmoid` and `minmax_scaler` help in normalizing the data and bringing non-linearity into play which aids in capturing complex relationships.
- `f7 f8 * quant_trans` is added to capture product relationships followed by quantile transformation which can help manage skewness in features.
- Combining `f6`, `f8`, and `f5` in the expression `f6 f8 f5 + / sigmoid` aims to generate a new feature that captures interactions involving multiple original features.
- `f9 reciprocal square` is used since `reciprocal` and `square` transformations can highlight inverse relationships and potential quadratics.
- `f1 tanh f19 tanh *` proposes a feature interaction between hyperbolic tangent transformations, possibly capturing the magnitude and direction of change in these features.

This new feature set aims to harness a variety of transformations to capture potential complex patterns that may aid in better prediction of software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This includes the use of compound transformations and feature interactions that could capture more subtle relationships within the data.

Here is a new improved feature set:

This feature set introduces more diversity by incorporating feature interactions (multiplying and dividing) alongside other transformations such as reciprocal, minmax scaling, and cube. This should offer a rich representation for the downstream task while minimizing feature redundancy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

```

### Explanation:
- **Feature Enhancements**: I've retained the useful transformations from the previous examples like using `sigmoid`, `log`, `tanh`, `sin`, `cube`, `sqrt`, etc., and applied them to different features.
- **Complex Transformations**: I've introduced complex transformation combinations like `f3 log`, `f7 stand_scaler`, `f2 log f9 sigmoid /`, combining various transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Feature Scaling and Normalization**: `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and other scaling techniques are strategically used for normalization and to better handle outliers or skewed distributions.
- **Trigonometric Transformations**: Functions like `sin` and `tanh` are preserved where applicable to help capture periodic patterns or saturating behaviors.

These transformations are aimed at uncovering hidden patterns in the data, improving the decision boundaries for classification tasks, and potentially enhancing model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

The improved feature set combines various transformation methods to leverage both linear and non-linear relationships across different feature combinations:

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Original Features**: Retain the original and transformed features to capitalize on direct patterns.
2. **Cubed Transformations**: Utilize cubic transformations as they can highlight high-order interactions and nonlinear relationships.
3. **Reciprocal**: Increase the emphasis on smaller feature values potentially acting as indicators of defects.
4. **Cosine and Sine Transformations**: Enhance capturing periodic or oscillatory behavior within certain features which might be essential.
5. **Square Transformations**: Provide another non-linear facet to features that might exhibit quadratic trends with defects.
6. **Feature Interactions**: Capture interactions between features, utilizing operations such as multiplication, addition, and subtraction. This can help model complex dependencies between different code metrics.
7. **New Interactions & Transformations**: Sqrt and reciprocal combinations with interactions to further model potentially useful relations in the context of defect prediction.

This combination aims to effectively capture a wide array of interactions between features, providing a robust feature set for improved defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

**Explanation of additional features:**

- `f2 cube`: Cubing the feature `f2` to capture any non-linear relationships.
- `f7 tanh`: Applying the hyperbolic tangent transformation on `f7` to compress its range between -1 and 1, which can be helpful for gradient-based models.
- `f19 log f18 reciprocal *`: Combining logarithmic transformations and reciprocals can help stabilize variance and normalize the distribution.
- `f3 sqrt f9 sqrt - stand_scaler`: Applying standard scaling after subtracting the square roots of `f3` and `f9`, potentially highlighting differences and reducing dimensionality effects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

Changes and considerations made:
- Focused on reciprocal transformations for potentially high-magnitude features (f8, f9, f10, f11) to highlight their relative contributions.
- Created interactions between f9 and f10 (* operation) as a new interaction feature since they involve complexity measures.
- Expanded the range of cosine transformations across varied features (removed redundancy from f7, experimented more with f12).
- Introduced transformations like square root and logarithm for potentially stabilizing variance across certain features with skew (f5, f7, f14).
- Incorporated f16 in a Min-Max scaling context, often useful for handling features with large spreads.
- Rethink creative linear combinations and transformations like tanh and reciprocal to find hidden interactions (e.g., f8 f12 / tanh).

This feature set aims to delve deeper into feature interactions and try to stabilize the skewed distributions for better capturing complex relationships in defect prediction.

### Explanation:
1. **Log and Square Root Transformations**: Adding `log` and `sqrt` can help in stabilizing variance and handling skewness, particularly for features that are strictly positive.
2. **Min-Max and Standard Scaler**: Using `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` ensures that the features fall within a certain range or have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which is useful for models sensitive to feature scale.
3. **Sigmoid Transformation**: Applying the `sigmoid` function can squash values, providing a bounded output which is helpful for classification tasks.
4. **Combining Transformations**: Features are created by combining transformations (e.g., `log` followed by `minmax_scaler`), allowing for capturing non-linear relationships.
5. **Feature Interaction**: Continuing with interactions like `f16 f10 * cube` maintains the capability to capture cross-feature effects which might be relevant to defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-11 22:43:20,921 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the examples provided, we aim to incorporate operations that transform features to potentially capture more complex relationships and interactions. The latter example uses many sigmoid transformations, which are often useful in scaling inputs to a similar range. We should continue to explore nonlinear transformations and combinations of features to make predictions more robust.

Here is a better feature set proposal:

```

,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f6 f9 + cube]
```

Explanation:
- We've used a combination of mathematical operations like `sqrt`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, and `reciprocal` to transform the individual features.
- Pairwise multiplications followed by transformations like `sqrt` and `tanh` are applied to capture potential interactions between features.
- `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` with a subsequent `sigmoid` transformation help in normalizing combined features.
- Introducing `cube` transformation provides additional nonlinear interaction possibilities.

In this set:
- I've included a diverse set of transformations such as sigmoid, tanh, reciprocal, and basic mathematical operations like square, cube, and addition.
- Selected a mix of raw features and transformed ones to maintain the diversity of inputs.
- Used combinations and transformations that especially focus on potentially impactful original features like `loc`, `v(g)`, `n`, and complex functions involving others for richer feature representation.
- Incorporated nonlinear transformations (e.g., sin, cos) to capture potential complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set:
- The use of reciprocal transformations on selected features improves the spread and importance of smaller values.
- Trigonometric operations like sin and cos are applied to enhance nonlinear interactions between features.
- The tanh transformation is used for its ability to compress the range of values, potentially enhancing the exploration of relationships between features.
- Ratios between transformed features (like `f0 sin f18 reciprocal /`) capture relative differences in feature dynamics.
- Selective feature transformations aim to create meaningful interactions and infuse nonlinearity, which could be helpful for complex predictive modeling.

In this feature set:
- We use reciprocal to potentially highlight inverse relationships, e.g. `f7 f8 * reciprocal`.
- We continue using the trigonometric transformation with `cos` on `f17`.
- We explore `sqrt` and `cube` for potential non-linear relationships with `f6` and `f11`.
- We maintain the `minmax_scaler` between squares of `f4` and `f5` to capture scale invariant interactions.
- We add a `log` transformation to `f16` to manage skewed distributions.
- We use `tanh` on `f9` to introduce non-linear saturation effects.
- Finally, we use `stand_scaler` on `f12` for standardization benefits.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-11 22:44:13,557 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions by feature engineering using the given operations and original features (f0, f1..., f20), I have designed a new feature set inspired by your examples. This new feature set aims to capture non-linear relationships, interactions between variables, and potentially significant transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 sqrt cube ,f1 sqrt tanh ,f0 f1 * reciprocal ,f4 tanh square ,f5 sqrt reciprocal ,f6 cos cube ,f8 cube f16 * ,f9 reciprocal tanh ,f10 cube f9 * ,f11 f12 * reciprocal ,f13 reciprocal tanh ,f14 reciprocal sqrt ,f17 cube quan_trans ,f18 sin f19 * ,f19 cube quan_trans ,f20 tanh cube ,f3 f7 * reciprocal ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f6 log]
```

This feature set:
- Utilizes cube and reciprocal transformations to emphasize the potential impact of high values while controlling possible skewness.
- Applies trigonometric transformations (tanh, cos, sin) to introduce non-linear mechanic properties, which may relate to code patterns.
- Captures interactions with multiplication, targeting combined influence of certain features (e.g., f8 cube f16 *).
- Incorporates data scaling techniques (minmax_scaler) for normalization, assisting algorithms to focus on underlying patterns.
- Uses log transformations to handle skewed data and express multiplicative relationships linearly.
- Explores squared transformations to highlight high-magnitude effects (e.g., f4 tanh square), aiding complex pattern recognition.

This approach should aid a downstream prediction task effectively.

Explanation:
- Included core features: Covering original features `f0` to `f20` to capture base information.
- Applied cubic transformation to selected features: This type of transformation can capture non-linearities in the data.
- Incorporated square root transformation: Reduces the scale of features and can help in handling right-skewed distributions.
- Combined basic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) followed by a cube: Adding variety and deeper feature interactions.
- Non-linear transformations with `cos`, `tanh`, `log`, and `reciprocal`: To capture different feature relationships and distributions.
- Choices were inspired by a mix of both provided sets, aiming to enhance potential efficacy by leveraging both transformations and feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-11 22:44:29,904 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature set examples, let's refine and improve them by examining their transformations and incorporating potentially beneficial operations while maintaining the format. Here's a suggestion:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f0 sigmoid, f1 sigmoid, f3 sigmoid, f4 sigmoid, f5 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f11 sigmoid, f12 sigmoid, f13 sigmoid, f14 sigmoid, f16 sigmoid, f17 sigmoid, f19 sigmoid, f20 sigmoid, f4 square f5 square + minmax_scaler sigmoid, f6 quan_trans sigmoid, f2 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f15 sigmoid, f18 sigmoid, f0 sin f0 reciprocal / cube, f16 tanh, f7 cube f6 sqrt + stand_scaler, f10 log, f8 cube, f1 cos]
```

### Key improvements:
1. **Enhanced transformations**: 
   - Added `f0 sin f0 reciprocal / cube` for potentially capturing intricate patterns in `f0`.
   - Applied `stand_scaler` to the sum of `f7 cube` and `f6 sqrt`, which may help in refining scales and distributions.
   - Introduced `f1 cos` to incorporate potential periodic characteristics in `f1`.

2. **Retained beneficial existing transformations**:
   - Preserved important sigmoid transformations which are useful for normalizing values.
   - Maintained other transformations such as tanh, cube, and log where they provide valuable scaled features.

These modifications aim to capture more complex interactions and scales between the features, improving the predictive capability of the models using this engineered feature set.
