2025-09-30 11:38:51,107 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using the given examples, we can aim to combine transformations that provide more non-linearity and potentially enhance prediction power. Below is an improved feature set inspired by the given examples, incorporating both linear and non-linear transformations, trigonometric functions, and scaling techniques:

```
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f7 sin, f8 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f14 sin, f7 cos, f10 cos, f14 cos, f5 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f14 tanh, f10 cos cos, f14 cos tanh, f10 sin cos, f10 tanh sqrt, f14 sin sigmoid, f7 sin quan_trans, f8 sin quan_trans, f14 cos tanh sin, f5 f0 - tanh, f7 f0 - square, f8 tanh f9 +]
```

In this feature set:
- We've retained all the original features (f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14) for baseline information.
- Utilized a mix of trigonometric functions (sin, cos), non-linear transformations (tanh, sigmoid, sqrt), and interactions to capture complex patterns.
- Incorporated scaling techniques like `quan_trans` to help with features that might have non-Gaussian distributions.
- Added combinations and transformations of differences (e.g., `f5 f0 - tanh`, `f7 f0 - square`) to explore interactions between features.

2025-09-30 11:38:59,283 - INFO - llm output = To create a better transformed feature set based on the two given examples, we should aim to combine techniques and strategies used in both to create informative and meaningful transformations that can potentially improve model performance. The first set primarily uses cosine transformations and quantile transformations. The second set focuses on reciprocal transformations, min-max scaling, and polynomial interactions.

Here is a new feature set combining these ideas:

```plaintext
[f8, f8 reciprocal, f10 minmax_scaler, 
 f7 f8 reciprocal *, f8 f12 *, f8 f13 *, 
 f8 f12 * f10 minmax_scaler *, f8 f13 * f5 reciprocal *, 
 f10 f8 * sin, f8 reciprocal f10 * cos, 
 f8 minmax_scaler f8 f13 * - sqrt, 
 f5 f10 * f8 reciprocal * f13 * - cos, 
 f6 cos f8 - square]
```

Explanation:
- We have maintained some transformations like reciprocal, min-max scaling, and interactions which have shown utility in the second set.
- We have integrated cosine and square transformations which were frequently used in the first set to potentially capture periodic patterns or reduce dimensionality.
- We incorporated a variety of operations, including combinations of sin and cos, sqrt, square, and maintaining some interactions from previous examples to enrich the feature set with potentially useful nonlinear relationships.
- These transformations aim to cover a diverse set of transformations that can help the model learn complex relations between features to predict the success of credit card applications.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:39:27,395 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, we can construct a new feature set that incorporates transformations aimed at capturing non-linear relationships, scaling, and other nuances in the data. While making sure to evaluate transformations that reside in high-performing sets in the examples, we will create a blend that bears a structure for potential strong features for the downstream task.

Here's a derived and potentially improved feature set:

[f1, f2, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14,  
f8 quan_trans, f9 sin quan_trans, f10 cos quan_trans, 
f14 cos quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, 
f10 quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, 
f1 cos, f2 cos, f7 cos, f9 sin sin sin quan_trans, 
f13 cos quan_trans, f14 cos quan_trans, 
f7 sin sin f1 * quan_trans sin, 
f0 sin, f11 reciprocal] 

This set includes elements from both previous sets while reusing feature transformations that involve quantile transformation and cosine transformation seen as useful in feature interactions. We maintained high-potential expressions that use methods like `sin`, `cos`, `reciprocal`, and interaction terms to potentially capture complex relationships.

2025-09-30 11:39:32,791 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, the second feature set is significantly simpler and likely more effective due to the inclusion of a quantile transformation (`quan_trans`) which can be beneficial for handling non-linear relationships and outliers. It transforms the data such that the distribution is uniform, helping to make algorithms more robust, especially for non-normal distributions. Here’s a one-step improved feature set building on this approach:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f8 f14 * quan_trans ,f8 f9 + minmax_scaler]
```

In this improved set:
- The original fifteen features are retained.
- An interaction term `f8 f14 *` (possibly representing a multiplication between scaled debt and scaled income) is already transformed using `quan_trans` as in the original transformed set.
- An additional derived feature `f8 f9 + minmax_scaler` is included, representing the min-max scaling of the sum of `f8` and `f9`, potentially capturing interesting dynamics between these features and normalizing them to the same range, which can improve model convergence and performance.

This simplifies the transformation further while potentially improving predictive performance by using two popular and effective transformations on different feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-30 11:39:46,951 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, the second set incorporates a significant amount of non-linear transformations, especially focusing on the sine function and differences between features, which can introduce complex non-linear relationships that might be beneficial for the prediction task given the right context.

For a "better" feature set, let's aim to combine some potentially useful transformations from both examples, focusing on leveraging non-linearity and robust scaling techniques to capture more complex patterns:

```
[f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f0 f1 * tanh, f0 f7 * sigmoid, f0 f10 * sigmoid, f0 f13 * sigmoid, f1 f0 * f10 * f14 * cube, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f7 cube, f10 cube, f14 cube, f5 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, f0 f1 * quan_trans, f0 f10 * quan_trans, f0 f14 * quan_trans, f7 stand_scaler cube, f8 stand_scaler cube, f6 f5 * sin, f5 f13 -, f7 f13 -, f0 f1 * f10 * f14 * sin, f14 square sin, f8 sin]
```

In this proposed feature set:
- I retained some linear terms and included interactions between numerical features multiplied together.
- I used both the combination of `tanh` and `sigmoid` functions to capture non-linearity in feature interactions.
- I incorporated `cube` transformations to potentially capture higher-degree polynomial relationships.
- I retained the quantile transformation for robustness against outliers and tailored scaling.
- I included differences as exploration of interactions and non-linear interactions with the sine function.
- The use of `stand_scaler` ensures the resulting features have standard normalization properties before further transformations.

This should provide a more comprehensive representation of the data's possible interactions and non-linear relationships, which can be crucial for predictive model performance, especially for complex datasets like this one.

2025-09-30 11:39:56,109 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, let's aim to create a better feature set by synthesizing the most potentially predictive interactions from the original features and feature transformations. We'll prioritize combinations that maximize potential insight into the relationship between features and the target variable (successful credit card application). The second example set is more complex and involves combination-forming interactions and transformations like multiplication and subtraction among multiple feature pairs. We'll keep this approach but focus on crafting a shorter but potentially more insightful feature set.

Here is an optimized feature set using a combination of operations and transformations:

```plaintext
[f8 f10 * , f14 f8 * , f12 f8 * cube , f8 f14 * sqrt , f2 f8 * sigmoid , f3 f10 * log , f8 f14 * f12 f8 * - , f12 f8 * f10 f14 * - , f8 f14 * f10 f13 * - sinh]
```

Explanation of the feature transformations used:
1. `f8 f10 *`: Interaction between years employed and credit score.
2. `f14 f8 *`: Interaction between income and years employed.
3. `f12 f8 * cube`: Cubic interaction term for exploring complex relationship between citizenship and years employed.
4. `f8 f14 * sqrt`: Square root of the interaction between years employed and income.
5. `f2 f8 * sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation of the interaction between age and years employed.
6. `f3 f10 * log`: Logarithmic transformation of the interaction between marriage status and credit score.
7. `f8 f14 * f12 f8 * -`: Difference between income*years employed and citizenship*years employed.
8. `f12 f8 * f10 f14 * -`: Difference between citizenship*years employed and credit score*income.
9. `f8 f14 * f10 f13 * - sinh`: Hyperbolic sine of the difference between income*years employed and credit score*zip code.

This feature set leverages interactions and transformations to capture complex underlying relationships that might be significant for the prediction task.

Explanation of new additions:
- `f14 sin minmax_scaler`: Normalizes the sine transformation of `f14` using Min-Max scaling, which can help in capturing standardized cyclical patterns.
- `f6 f5 * sin sigmoid`: Applies a sigmoid transformation to the sine of the product of `f6` and `f5`, which helps dampen extreme values and can be useful for capturing interactions that might indicate diminishing or enhancing returns.
- `f9 sin cube`: Cubes the sine transformation of `f9`, capturing higher-order periodic interactions that may relate more strongly to the target variable in the context of credit score-related features.

- I'll include a mix of original features and their interactions:
  - Retain some basic features that are consistently present: f7, f8, f9, f10, f14.
  - Include meaningful interactions: `f0 f1 *`, `f0 f10 *`, `f0 f14 *`.

- Apply both standard scaling and quantile transformation:
  - Use stand_scaler and quan_trans together on certain features like the latter feature set suggests.
  - Use square function to capture non-linear relationships.

2025-09-30 11:40:28,375 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better set of features, we need to improve upon the previous sets by using effective transformations that might reveal better insights from the data, facilitating the downstream prediction task.

Considering the two provided feature sets, a powerful approach combines both transformation techniques and arithmetic combinations of the features. A feature set should aim to extract meaningful information and possibly capture non-linear relationships in the data.

Let's create a new feature set using some of the more advanced transformation techniques like quantile transformation, min-max scaling, and including interactions based on production.

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f8 f14 * quan_trans , f8 f9 + minmax_scaler , f2 f8 * log , f13 f8 * / , f14 f8 - , f2 f14 * reciprocal , f3 f2 - f14 / , f10 f8 / f14 - , f12 f8 * minmax_scaler , f5 f9 * f3 f10 + sqrt]
```

In this new feature set:
- We maintain some features from the previous sets that apply transformations (`quan_trans`, `minmax_scaler`) for improving distribution and scaling.
- We explore additional operations that consider the natural logarithm, reciprocal, and square root operations to capture non-linearities and potential interactions.
- Arithmetic operations involving differences and ratios are included to create new interaction terms that might unveil hidden patterns.
- The goal is to survey a diverse array of transformations and combinations in order to distinguish different patterns in the successful credit card applications.

In this improved set:
- I retained core individual features (f0 to f14) to ensure no information is lost.
- Included `f8 f14 * quan_trans` to capture potential interactions normalized through quantile transformation.
- Added `f8 f9 + minmax_scaler` for combined scale normalization.
- Introduced a quantile transformation of sum `f7 f8 +` to uncover non-linear relations.
- Used logarithm on `f5 f14 +` to dampen potential extreme values and capture multiplicative relationships.
- Applied square root transformation to `f9 f10 +` to reduce skewness and emphasize lower range values.
- Min-max scaled the product `f4 f13 *` to keep this interaction within a normalized range.
- Implemented a sigmoid transformation to the sum `f0 f6 +` for a bounded non-linear interaction, potentially addressing non-linearity in relationships.

Here's a new feature set that leverages a combination of multiplicative interactions, summing diverse feature transformations, and potentially combining complementary coverage from the original sets:

```

]
```

In this new feature set:
- I've included the use of `sqrt` and `log` for better scaling and normalization of certain complex interactions.
- The core idea is to decline excessive use of a single feature in too many interactions, this avoids potential overfitting from redundant perspectives.
- The combined terms aim to capture different interaction effects across multiple features while keeping the trend of complex transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:40:51,409 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, I'll suggest a better feature set by considering the existing transformations and adding meaningful operations to enhance prediction performance:

1. Retain the original features for comparison, as they might still be informative.
2. Incorporate transformations that better capture non-linear relationships.
3. Add statistical scaling methods to normalize features.
4. Make use of combinations of features to capture interactions.

Here is the improved feature set:

Explanation of additions/modifications:
- `f7 minmax_scaler`: Normalizes `f7` to focus on its relative scale within the dataset.
- `f6 f5 * sin minmax_scaler`: Normalizes the interaction of `f6` and `f5` post-transformation to emphasize scaled interactions.
- `f10 stand_scaler`: Applies standard scaling to `f10` to normalize its distribution.
- `f14 stand_scaler`: Applies standard scaling to `f14` for normalization.
- `f13 reciprocal` and its variants: Uses reciprocal transformation to handle skewness, emphasizing upside-down relationships.
- `f14 tanh`: Uses hyperbolic tangent to capture non-linearities.
- `f8 sin sin tanh` and `f9 sin sin tanh`: Combines transformations to emphasize further non-linearities.

These modifications aim to enhance feature representability by capturing more complex patterns and relationships.

The first feature set utilizes significant combinations and arithmetic operations which may capture more intricate relationships within the data. The second set maintains a simpler structure and uses scaling and transformation techniques to ensure features are within the same range and potentially more linearly separable.

Here is a new proposed feature set that aims to capture the complexity of interactions and combinations while also utilizing scaling/transformation techniques, where applicable:

In this set, I've retained the original features as in the second set while adding complex interaction terms using multiplication and addition from the first set. I then apply a scaling transformation to ensure the new features are more normalized and uniform for better model training.

Explanation:
1. `f8 f14 * sqrt`: Sqrt of product of two features often reduces skewness and might unwrap non-linear relationships.
2. `f9 f10 + log`: Log of sum of two features might help stabilize variance.
3. `f13 f8 * quan_trans`: Applying quantile transformation on interaction can make the distribution more uniform.
4. `f2 f8 * tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent on an interaction term can capture saturation effects.
5. `f5 f14 + minmax_scaler`: Min-max scaling maintains relative relationships.
6. `f0 f6 + sqrt`: Sqrt on the sum might help in dealing with growth-like relationships.
7. `f3 f9 * sigmoid`: Sigmoid can squish the product into a probability range, potentially highlighting binary-style interactions.
8. `f11 f14 * / sin`: Using trigonometric functions on ratios can expose periodic interactions.
9. `f1 f12 + cube`: Cubing can enhance the distinction in relationships that have outperforming features.
10. `f0 f9 * - cos`: Use cosine for capturing periodic variation.
11. `f7 f8 + stand_scaler`: Standard scaling helps in comparing features with different units/scales.
12. `f10 f8 * - stand_scaler`: Subtracting and scaling an interaction term can provide various scaling-related insights.

Explanation:
- I retained base features (`f7, f8, f9, f10, f14`) as they might be essential for prediction without transformation.
- Selected consistent transformations like `sin`, `stand_scaler`, and `sin sin` for features based on previous sets.
- Combined operations such as multiplication and addition to see potential multi-variable interactions (`f2 f6 minmax_scaler +`, `f0 f7 * sqrt`).
- A mix of single and compound transformations has been implemented to enrich the feature space.

This new feature set will focus on incorporating diverse transformations and interactions to potentially capture more intricate patterns in the data.

Here's an explanation of a few selected transformations:
- `f5 f6 *`: Feature 5 and 6 interaction, potentially capturing variations in debt and job sector productively correlated to credit card success.
- `f5 f5 * cube sin`: Applying feature scaling and non-linear transformations to debt for capturing nuanced relationships.
- `f9 sin log`: Combination using logarithmic transformation can emphasize variation in binary variables like employment.
- `f6 f14 / sin sqrt`: Ratio of specific features like job industry and income can further normalize feature impact.
- `f10 f13 - square`: Interaction emphasizing the difference between CreditScore and ZipCode, high variance feature possibly indicating geographical influence on credit success.
- `f14 reciprocal sin`: Applying a reciprocal transformation helps mitigate skewness in features like Income, improving learning model performance. 

These transformations incorporate non-linear and interaction effects, potentially offering more diverse patterns in the data for prediction.

2025-09-30 11:41:16,747 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, I'll create a new feature set that leverages the transformations and combinations from both examples while attempting to enhance the predictive capabilities for the downstream task. The goal is to select and construct the features that may capture complex interactions and non-linearities within the data.

Here's a new feature set that combines ideas from both examples and introduces some additional transformations:

```
[f2 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f13 ,f14 ,f0 f1 * ,f0 f2 * ,f0 f5 * ,f0 f7 * ,f5 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f13 stand_scaler ,f14 stand_scaler ,f2 square ,f5 square ,f7 square ,f0 f1 * square ,f2 tanh ,f7 f8 * ,f7 f9 * ,f8 f10 *sin ,f13 f14 / ,f5 f2 + log ,f6 f13 * reciprocal ,f14 quan_trans ,f9 sigmoid sin stand_scaler ,f10 log ,f8 sin sin f7 *]
```

Explanation for some transformations:
- Feature combinations such as `f7 f8 *` and `f7 f9 *` to consider interactions between certain features that could capture relevant relationships in the data.
- Use of transformations like `stand_scaler`, `square`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `log` to capture non-linearities.
- Applying operations like `sin` and `reciprocal` to specific feature transformations might help in stabilizing the variance and centering the data, respectively.
- Introducing logarithmic and reciprocal transformations to address potential skewness in the data distribution.

These changes aim to capture complex patterns potentially useful for predicting credit card application success.

2025-09-30 11:41:19,927 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given two examples, let's leverage a combination of the two approaches, taking into account both multiplicative and additive interactions among features. This helps to capture a diverse range of relationships, enhancing the predictive power of the features.

Here's a combined feature set:

```
[f8 f13 * ,f8 f14 * ,f12 f8 * ,f13 f8 * ,f10 f13 + ,f12 f13 + ,f8 f2 * f8 - ,f3 f10 * f8 - ,f5 f10 * f8 - ,f7 f10 * f8 - ,f8 f2 * f8 f14 * - ,f8 f10 * f10 f14 * - ,f8 f13 f7 + * ,f11 f8 + f13 + ,f11 f9 + f13 + ,f7 f11 f8 + + ]
```

In this set:
- We've retained some multiplicative interactions from the first feature set for their potential to capture complex nonlinear relationships.
- We've included additive interactions from the second feature set to incorporate linear combinations and simple interactions.
- A mix of these operations is intended to provide a broad spectrum of interactions that can contribute to predictive accuracy.

This set includes:

1. All original features to maintain the baseline information.
2. Features `f8 f14 * quan_trans` and `f8 f9 + minmax_scaler` from the second example, which potentially capture some interactions or useful transformations.
3. New features:
   - `f8 f9 * sqrt`: Applying a square root transformation after multiplication to capture interactions in a non-linear manner.
   - `f10 f11 * log`: Using a logarithmic scale on the product of these features, which can help in capturing multiplicative relationships and their log-scale impacts.
   - `f13 f14 * log`: Similar logarithmic transformation for a different pair of features to explore their log interactions.
   - `f2 f10 * stand_scaler`: Standardizing the product of these features to enhance their suitability for models sensitive to feature scales.

These transformations and interactions aim to extract more nuanced patterns from the data, which may lead to improved predictive performance.

In this new feature set:

- I've included interactions between different features using multiplication to capture potential interactions.
- Applied non-linear transformations across select features including `tanh` and `sin` to capture complex relationships.
- Used `stand_scaler` for standardization to ensure even scaling across features.
- Utilized `sin` in combination with other functions to experiment with potential harmonic patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:42:04,211 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples and operations, the goal is to improve feature generation by transforming existing features into more informative ones for the downstream prediction task while adhering to the postfix expression format. Below is a proposed feature set that takes into consideration transformations from the examples you provided. The aim is to derive a more robust representation that could potentially enhance predictive performance:

```plaintext
[f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f5 , f6 , f7 , f8 , f9 , f10 , f11 , f12 , f13 , f14 , f8 f14 * stand_scaler , f8 f9 + minmax_scaler , f9 f10 + reciprocal , f7 f11 * sqrt , f2 f6 * log , f5 f13 * sin]
```

In this set:
- `f8 f14 * stand_scaler` standardizes the product of features 8 and 14.
- `f8 f9 + minmax_scaler` scales the sum of features 8 and 9 to a range [0, 1].
- `f9 f10 + reciprocal` calculates the reciprocal for the sum of features 9 and 10, emphasizing small values.
- `f7 f11 * sqrt` takes the square root of the product of features 7 and 11, which can help in modeling multiplicative interactions.
- `f2 f6 * log` applies a logarithmic transformation to the product of features 2 and 6, useful when dealing with skewed data.
- `f5 f13 * sin` uses a sine transformation on the product of features 5 and 13, introducing a nonlinear perspective.

The choice of transforms such as `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `reciprocal`, and `log` are driven by their potential to normalize and stabilize variance, as well as emphasize or suppress certain interactions that might be critical for predicting credit card application success.

2025-09-30 11:42:21,791 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets you provided, I'll construct a new feature set by examining and combining the most promising transformations from each set. The first set makes extensive use of sine transformations and scaling, while the second set utilizes more standardization, quantile transformation, and polynomial features. A balanced combination that leverages diverse transformations could improve predictions.

Here's the new feature set:

```plaintext
[f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f14 ,
 f0 f7 * ,f0 f10 * ,f0 f13 * ,f0 f14 * ,

 f0 f10 * quan_trans stand_scaler , 
 f8 stand_scaler square ,
 f8 sin stand_scaler ,f6 f5 * sin sin ,f14 square sin sin ,f5 sin sigmoid ]
```

This new feature set combines quantitative transformations (standardization, quantile transformation) with non-linear transformations such as sine and sigmoid functions, along with polynomial features. This approach aims to capture linear and non-linear interactions while maintaining essential information from the original feature sets.

Explanation and rationale for some features:
- Incorporating mathematical functions like "sqrt", "log", and transformations like "minmax_scaler" and "quan_trans" provides the opportunity to uncover non-linear relationships and adjust the scale, potentially improving predictive performance.
- Operations like "tanh" and "sigmoid" may help in squashing the range of certain features, making them more suitable for models sensitive to input ranges.
- Combining features using arithmetic operations allows us to explore potential interactions between them, which might be critical in influencing the outcome.

[f7 , f8 , f9 , f10 , f14 , f14 stand_scaler sin , f14 square sin , f6 f5 * sin , f8 sin stand_scaler sin , f5 sin , f7 sin , f8 sin , f9 sin , f2 f13 - , f5 f13 - , f6 f13 - , f7 f13 - , f8 f13 - , f9 f13 - , f10 f13 - , f14 f13 - , f8 sin stand_scaler sin sin , f6 f5 * sin sin , f10 stand_scaler sin sin , f14 stand_scaler sin sin , f10 sin , f14 sin , f5 sin sigmoid , f7 quan_trans , f14 square sin sin , f8 sin sin , f9 sin sin, f14 f9 / sinh , f7 f5 sqrt * , f2 f13 - reciprocal ]
```

### Explanation:
- **`f14 f9 / sinh`**: Adds a new feature where the division of `f14` by `f9` is taken through a hyperbolic sine transformation. This aims to capture non-linear interactions between these two features.
- **`f7 f5 sqrt *`**: Multiplies `f7` by the square root of `f5`, capturing potential interaction effects and variations.
- **`f2 f13 - reciprocal`**: Computes the reciprocal of the difference between `f2` and `f13`, which might help in capturing inversely proportional relationships.

These additions aim to introduce new non-linear transformations and interactions, potentially improving model performance by capturing complex patterns in the data.

Here's a new feature set that combines and extends the ideas from both examples:

```plaintext
[f2, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f0 f1 *, f0 f2 *, f0 f8 *, f0 f10 *, f0 f13 *, f0 f14 *, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f2 square, f5 square, f7 square, f9 square, f10 square, f14 square, f0 f1 * square, f2 tanh, f9 cube, f6 log, f13 reciprocal, f8 sigmoid]
```

### Explanation:
- Added **`f0 f2 *`** to capture potential interaction between gender and prior default.
- Included **`f0 f8 *`** for potential interaction between gender and years employed.
- Retained key existing interactions from previous sets, such as **`f0 f10 *`**, **`f0 f13 *`**, **`f0 f14 *`**.
- Applied **`stand_scaler`** to key features to ensure normalization, which can be especially beneficial for models sensitive to feature scaling like SVM and neural networks.
- **`square`** and **`cube`** for non-linear transformations to capture higher-order relationships.
- **`tanh`**, **`sigmoid`**, **`log`**, and **`reciprocal`** transformations to attenuate the effect of extreme values and introduce non-linear compression.
  
This set leverages both linear and non-linear transformations to uncover complex relationships within the dataset, potentially leading to better predictive performance.

2025-09-30 11:43:06,817 - INFO - llm output = Here's a new feature set that builds on the examples you provided, aiming to capture useful information while reducing redundancy and increasing the potential discriminative power for predicting credit card application success:

```
[f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f0 f1 *, f0 f7 *, f0 f13 *, f0 f14 *, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f7 square, f10 square, f14 square, f5 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f0 f1 * quan_trans, f0 f14 * quan_trans, f7 stand_scaler square, f8 stand_scaler square, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f0 f5 * tanh, f0 f14 * cube]
```

Explanation of the revisions:

1. **Retained Core Features**: The core features `f7, f8, f9, f10, f14` are retained as they might have consistent predictive power.

2. **Retain and Modify Core Interactions**: The interactions between different features, like `f0 f1 *, f0 f7 *, f0 f14 *, etc.` are retained because they represent potentially valuable interactions between features.

3. **Feature Scaling**: Keep `f7, f8, f9, f10, f14` with standard scaling to ensure normalization when necessary.

4. **Non-linear Transformations**: Introduced non-linear transformations:
   - `f5 tanh` and `f6 tanh` for non-linear effects related to `YearsEmployed` and `PriorDefault`.
   - `f0 f5 * tanh` combines `Gender` interaction with `YearsEmployed` to capture gender bias in employment history if any.
   - `f0 f14 * cube` introduces a non-linear interaction of `Gender` with `Income`, which might capture socio-economic disparities.

5. **High-dimensional Feature Interactions**: Additional high-order transformations like `square` and a new introduction of `cube` to explore non-linear dependencies and capture underlying patterns potentially missed by linear transformations. 

6. **Feature Selection from Examples**: Focus on transformations (like `quan_trans`) that can provide a higher resolution view of skewed data.
