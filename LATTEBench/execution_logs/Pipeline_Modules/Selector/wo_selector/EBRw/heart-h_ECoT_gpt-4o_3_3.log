### Explanation:

1. **Basic Features**: Retain `f2, f7, f8, f9, f10` as these are frequently used and might be pivotal.
2. **Nonlinear Transformations**: Keep transformations like `f8 sigmoid`, `f10 cos sigmoid`, `f2 square sigmoid`, and `f7 sigmoid square`, given their inclusion suggests potential non-linear relationships.
3. **Derived Interactions**: Use features like `f2 f3 f2 * cube /`, `f10 f3 f2 * cube /`, `f7 f10 * f3 f2 * cube /`, which explore complex interactions possibly unique enough to capture hidden patterns.
4. **Scaling and Centering**: Include transformations like `f9 stand_scaler`, and features scaled by square or square root functions to adjust their distributions for model robustness.
5. **Combinations and Reductions**: Retain subtractive combinations like `f8 f9 -` and square root transformations like `f2 sqrt` to reduce dimensionality and explore additional interactions.

I'll select a mix of transformations that handle non-linear relationships, normalizations to ensure consistent feature ranges, and other potentially useful mathematical transformations.

Here's a suggested feature set combining transformation ideas from both sets:

```
[f9 ,f8 ,f2 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f4 log ,f8 f8 + sqrt ,f8 f8 + sqrt sqrt ,f9 f9 + sqrt ,f9 f10 + sqrt ,f2 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f9 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f2 sqrt quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f8 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler ,f2 sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f9 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f9 sqrt quan_trans ,f10 sqrt quan_trans]
```

In this set:
- Non-linearities are captured via square root, quantile transformation, and squaring (e.g., `f8 f8 + sqrt`).
- We perform normalization and scaling using standard scaler and min-max scaling.
- Mathematical transformations such as logarithms and square roots are used to reduce skew and handle wide value ranges.
- Combinations of features (e.g., `f9 f10 +`) help capture interactions.

These transformations and scalings might help the model learn more effectively from the data by exposing richer patterns and normalizing outlier effects. Adjust the transformations based on cross-validation results for optimal performance improvements.

2025-10-22 00:53:41,336 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set given the two examples, we can focus on using transformations that enhance the ability to capture complex relationships within the data while also reducing redundancy and emphasizing the most informative features.

```

### Explanation:
- **Feature Transformations**: 
  - Including `f3 cube` and `f7 cube` retains the non-linear transformation to explore cubic relationships.
  - The transformation `[f3 f7 +]` captures interactions between resting blood pressure and heart rate, which can be significant in cardiovascular predictions.
  - Using trigonometric functions like `sin` and `cos` on `f3` and `f7` allows us to explore periodic relationships in the data.
  
- **Non-linear and Interaction Terms**:
  - `f7 f3 *`: Multiplying these features may capture multiplicative interactions in cardiology variables.
  - Including `f3 f4 /` explores the ratio between blood pressure and cholesterol, which could offer insights into cardiovascular risks.
  
- **Normalization**: 
  - Keeping `minmax_scaler` for select features helps in normalizing data to a standard range, thus improving model convergence and interpretability. Selecting only certain features like `f0`, `f2`, `f9`, and `f12` ensures focus remains on features with broader variability.
  
- **Logarithmic Transformation**:
  - Using `log` on `f8` allows for handling skewness in exercise-induced angina data or other features capturing counts.

By crafting these features based on interaction terms, non-linear relationships, scaling, and select transformations, we improve the overall feature set's capability to capture complex patterns in the prediction of heart disease presence.

The goal is to create features that are potentially more informative for downstream machine learning algorithms.

Here's an improved feature set combining elements from the two given examples:

```
[f10 square f2 cos + , f10 square f8 square + , f10 cos f8 cube + , f2 cube f10 + minmax_scaler f2 cos + , f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / cube f5 + minmax_scaler f2 cos + , f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / cube f5 + minmax_scaler f10 cos + , f10 square , f10 cube , f2 f4 / , f9 cos , f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / sigmoid , f2 cos f10 square + , f8 minmax_scaler , f9 sqrt , f8 cube f10 + , f10 cos f9 + , f2 cos f10 + ]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Use of Nonlinear Transformations:** We retain and emphasize square and cube transformations, especially on potentially crucial features like f10 and f8. These transformations can capture nonlinear relationships in the data.
  
- **Combining Spatial Features:** Using combinations like `f10 square f2 cos +` and `f10 square f8 square +` could capture interactions between important features considering the nature of the problem (with `f2` and `f8/10` being involved in multiple transformations).

- **Feature Scaling:** Min-max scaling and similar transformations are used to normalize certain interactions, which can help models converge faster and reduce bias due to scale differences.

- **Trigonometric and Reciprocal Functions:** Including trigonometric transformations like `cos` in various combinations adds a degree of non-linearity that might capture specific data patterns useful for making predictions.

- **Usage of Calculated Ratios:** The ratio `f2 f4 /` is retained as it could represent a meaningful relationship between these two features related to heart health indicators.

This feature set incorporates elements from the previous examples while striving to leverage multiple transformation techniques and relationship explorations to provide a wider variety of input features for prediction tasks.

Given features:

1. `[f2 ,f9 , ... ,f8 sqrt f3 f2 * cube / cube]`

The latter feature set includes combinations that incorporate cube transformations and interactions between features, which could potentially capture non-linear relationships. It also uses some transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `sqrt`, which could help normalize or capture variations in the original data.

Improved Feature Set:

To improve upon these sets, we should utilize a variety of transformations while ensuring that the resulting features possibly capture more patterns:

- Add more diverse nonlinear transformations (e.g., logarithmic or trigonometric operations) to capture complex patterns.
- Combine interactions between more features to explore relational dynamics.

Here's a proposed feature set:

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The second feature set already includes a variety of transformations such as `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `stand_scaler`, and `quan_trans`, which are beneficial for scaling and transforming non-linear relationships.

Here's an enhanced version of the feature set that builds upon the strategies seen in the examples:

```
[f2 ,f9 ,f10 ,f2 sqrt sqrt ,f10 sqrt sqrt ,f8 log ,f2 sqrt stand_scaler ,f10 sqrt stand_scaler ,f10 sin ,f2 minmax_scaler tanh ,f8 sqrt tanh ,f10 minmax_scaler tanh ,f9 sqrt quan_trans ,f8 cube ,f10 cos sigmoid sqrt f2 square sigmoid square sqrt / ,f10 stand_scaler f2 square sigmoid square sqrt / ,f10 stand_scaler f8 stand_scaler / ,f2 square sigmoid square sqrt sqrt f8 stand_scaler / ,f10 square sqrt sqrt f2 square sigmoid square sqrt / ,f10 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f8 quan_trans ,f10 stand_scaler f2 square sigmoid square sqrt / minmax_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler f8 stand_scaler / minmax_scaler ,f2 square sigmoid square sqrt sqrt f8 stand_scaler / quan_trans]
```

In this version:

- I've retained useful transformations such as `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and `sigmoid` to handle data scaling and non-linearities.
- Added `log` for `f8` to potentially handle any skewness in the data.
- Included additional `tanh` transformations to provide more nuanced outputs in the range [-1, 1], which can help in distinguishing feature effects.
- Incorporated `cube` for `f8` to explore additional polynomial relationships.
- Maintained key feature transformation combinations from both sets that showed potential in capturing complex relationships (e.g., `f10 cos sigmoid sqrt f2 square sigmoid square sqrt /`).

This feature set aims to capture non-linear patterns and interactions that are crucial for improving predictions of heart disease presence.

Improvements made:
- Included diverse transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, `sin`, and `scalers` for extracting valuable features.
- Removed redundancies and focused on transformations that appeared in both feature sets, signaling importance.
- Emphasized normalization with `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to standardize the data.

2025-10-22 00:55:36,968 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set, we'll consider combining elements from the two provided feature sets to maximize potential predictive power by incorporating meaningful transformations and interactions. We aim to create features that could enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns or relationships, given the types of transformations and operations provided.

Here is my proposal for a better feature set:

```plaintext
[f2 f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / cube f5 + minmax_scaler + cube , f10 square f2 cos + minmax_scaler , f10 square f2 + minmax_scaler , f10 f2 cos + minmax_scaler , f2 f9 cos + minmax_scaler , f2 cos f10 + minmax_scaler , f10 cos f9 + minmax_scaler , f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / cube f5 + minmax_scaler f2 + minmax_scaler , f2 f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / cube f5 + minmax_scaler + cube minmax_scaler , f2 cos f10 square + minmax_scaler , f2 cos f2 cube f10 + minmax_scaler + sigmoid , f2 f10 square + cube , f3 f2 * f3 f9 * / cube f5 + sigmoid , f2 cube f10 + minmax_scaler f2 cos + ]
```

Explanation:
1. **Feature with Multiple Operations**: The feature with multiple transformations (minmax_scaler, cube, etc.) allows capturing non-linear relationships.
2. **Combinations using Min-Max Scaling**: Ensures features are on a comparable scale, which can be beneficial for certain models like neural networks and SVMs.
3. **Use of Cube and Square**: Introduces non-linearity and possible interactions that might capture complex dependencies.
4. **Cosine and Sum Interactions**: Capturing potential harmonious nature or cyclic patterns in relationships.
5. **Sigmoid Transformation**: Useful for squashing values between 0 and 1, which can be useful for logistic regression or neural networks.

This set balances complexity and potential interpretability while using available operations.

2025-10-22 00:55:42,813 - INFO - llm output = When tasked with improving feature engineering for predicting heart disease and given two feature sets, we aim to combine elements that capture complexity along with necessary transformations for stability. Both feature sets you've provided have elements that can be combined and optimized for potentially better predictive capability.

Here's a crafted feature set that merges the beneficial transformations and combinations observed in the provided examples:

```plaintext
[f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / cube f5 + minmax_scaler f2 cos + cube ,
 f8 sqrt f3 f2 * sqrt f3 f8 * / * + ,

```

### Explanation:
- **Complex Interactions:** The calculations include complex interactions like `f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / cube`, promoting feature combinations that may capture non-linear relationships.
- **Transformations:** A variety of transformations (e.g., square root, cube, sigmoid, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`) are used to normalize and stabilize the data, crucial when inputs have varying scales and units. This is also important for features that might benefit from non-linear scaling.
- **Combining Elements:** Some elements from each provided set are combined, such as incorporating cosine and `minmax_scaler` with the complex interactions to leverage potential advantages in scaling and relationships.
- **Overall Approach:** The combination of the above provides both an attempt to capture complex interdependencies and use transformations for scaling and stabilization, balancing complexity with algorithmic requirements for predictive tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

In this feature set, we have:

- Prioritized the use of combination transformations like sqrt, tanh, reciprocal, and stand_scaler that are known to stabilize distributions and enhance feature interactions.
- Leveraged complex transformations like cube and reciprocal to capture non-linear relationships.
- Integrated functions like sqrt and tanh alongside minmax_scaler and stand_scaler to manage feature variance and scaling, thus improving model training efficiency and prediction accuracy.

2025-10-22 00:56:03,172 - INFO - llm output = For each new feature set, we should aim to combine components that leverage useful interactions or transformations, ultimately yielding features potentially more informative for the prediction task. Here's a better feature representation based on the provided examples:

- **New Feature Set:**

  ```
  f3 f2 * f3 f8 * / f8 sqrt f3 f2 * cube / minmax_scaler f9 + * stand_scaler
  ```

**Explanation:**

1. **Interactions and Transformations:**
   - The expression begins similar to the prior feature sets, using interactions like `f3 f2 * f3 f8 * /` that suggest potential correlations between those variables.
   - The transformations used (e.g., `sqrt`, `cube`, `minmax_scaler`) are likely chosen based on data distribution and importance. They aim to normalize the data, highlight nonlinear relationships, or reduce skew.

2. **Structuring and Enhancements:**
   - Using `sqrt` on specific ratios and cubes boosts certain nonlinear correlations.
   - Combining results with `minmax_scaler` can stabilize the feature magnitude, making it more interpretable and usable for various machine learning models.
   - Adding `f9` after these complex operations might suggest its predictive importance, potentially capturing additional patterns.
   - Applying the `stand_scaler` at the end of the expression provides a standardized output, helping models that require normalized features (e.g., SVM, PCA).

Overall, this formulation effectively harnesses interactions and transformations from prior feature sets, subsequently enhanced by structured feature scaling and summation to accommodate more data-driven insights aligned with the heart disease prediction task.

2025-10-22 00:56:34,440 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature engineering techniques, we should focus on selecting transformations that help capture non-linear relationships and provide meaningful scales of the data for better predictions. Additionally, transformations such as scaling and non-linear functions (e.g., `sin`, `tanh`) can help stabilize variance and make the model more robust to outliers.

Let's merge the good ideas from both feature sets to create a potentially better feature set. Here's a combination that attempts to capture non-linear relationships and stabilize variance:

```
[f2 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f2 minmax_scaler sqrt ,f10 stand_scaler sqrt ,f2 cube minmax_scaler ,f8 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f8 sqrt tanh ,f10 sqrt stand_scaler tanh ,f2 sin ,f10 sin ,f9 sin ,f2 sqrt sin ,f8 sqrt sqrt sin ,f10 minmax_scaler sin square ,f2 stand_scaler quan_trans ,f10 sqrt cube ,f2 square sigmoid square sqrt minmax_scaler ,f8 tanh sin ,f10 stand_scaler cube tanh ]
```

This feature set incorporates a mix of transformations to explore interactions and non-linear relationships, such as squaring, taking the square root, applying trigonometric functions (`sin`, `tanh`), scaling (`minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`), and quantile transformation (`quan_trans`). This combined approach may help improve predictive performance by offering a diverse array of representations of the original features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
