### Explanation of Transformations:
- **Use of Non-linear Operators**: I've incorporated cube, sigmoid, log, and tanh transformations, capturing potential non-linear relationships which are often beneficial in predictive modeling.
- **Combination and Interaction**: By combining features using summation and multiplication, the model can capture interactions between variables. This is important when features may impact the target in combination rather than isolation.
- **Standardization/Normalization**: The inclusion of scaling transformations like minmax_scaler and stand_scaler helps in stabilizing the feature space, making it beneficial for certain algorithms that are sensitive to different scales of input.
- **Reciprocal and Sqrt**: Offers a way to handle skewness and reduces the impact of large outliers.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Transformations:** Applied different transformations (e.g., `sqrt`, `log`, `tanh`, and scaling methods) to single features to capture non-linear relationships.

2. **Interactions Terms:** Created interaction terms, especially multiplying features with `f11` (freeswap), as this feature likely has significant influence according to how frequently it appears in given examples.

3. **Non-linear Scaling/Transformation:** Used transformations like `tanh`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler` after forming interaction terms to further capture non-linear effects and ensure features are in common ranges or normalized.

Combining these techniques may enhance the data's representation capacity, particularly when fed into a predictive modeling algorithm that can leverage non-linearities and interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```
[f11 f5 * , f10 f5 / , f2 f5 + , f2 f6 + , f2 f11 f0 * + , f10 f6 / , f4 f2 * , f3 f11 * , f2 f11 f3 * + , f5 f11 f3 * + , f0 f6 * , f7 f11 * , f8 f11 * , f9 f11 * , f11 f0 * log, f11 f1 * log, f11 f2 * log, f11 f3 * log, f5 f3 - sqrt, f2 f5 + tanh, f6 f11 f0 * + tanh, f11 f0 * f2 + tanh, f11 f0 * f5 + tanh, f11 reciprocal quan_trans tanh, f2 reciprocal quan_trans sqrt, f2 reciprocal quan_trans log]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Interaction**: Continue interactions among features, focusing on those that have demonstrated potential like `f11` and multiplication with other features (e.g., `f11 f5 *`, `f10 f5 /`).

2. **Logarithmic Transformations**: Apply log transformations to the interactions of the original features with `f11`, which can help reduce skewness in distributions (e.g., `f11 f0 * log`).

3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Utilize `sqrt`, `tanh`, and other non-linear operations to capture non-linearity and enhance distinction (e.g., `f5 f3 - sqrt`, `f2 f5 + tanh`).

4. **Reciprocal and Quantile Transform**: Applying both reciprocal and quantile transformations on individual features to potentially make them more normal-distribution-like (e.g., `f11 reciprocal quan_trans tanh`).

This selection attempts to explore complex patterns and interactions that may not be obvious in the raw features, improving the model's ability to capture underlying relationships.

2025-11-07 15:32:45,361 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set for predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode, we should consider combining elements from the given feature sets and introducing transformations that are likely to capture non-linear relationships and interactions among the features. Here's a new feature set using a combination of elements from the provided examples:

- Keep the primary features for the initial transformation analysis.
- Use feature engineering operations like quantile transformation, min-max scaling, and non-linear transformations such as sigmoid, cube, or reciprocal to capture complex relationships among variables.
- Introduce new features derived from meaningful combinations and transformations:

```plaintext
[f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f11 quan_trans,
f11 f3 / quan_trans, f5 f10 - quan_trans, f11 f2 minmax_scaler,
f11 f3 / f4 + cube, f11 f3 / f5 + reciprocal, f5 f10 - sqrt,
f11 f3 / tanh, f11 f3 / log, f11 f3 / sqrt, f11 f3 / std_scaler,
f5 f10 - reciprocal, f11 f3 / f11 f0 / + minmax_scaler,
f11 f3 / f3 + std_scaler, f11 f3 / f3 + log, f11 f3 / f3 + reciprocal]
```

**Explanation:**

- Basic features (`f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5`, `f11`) are transformed using quantile transformation to handle skewness in distribution.
- The division of `f11` by `f3` is used multiple times, indicating that this feature might capture a key interaction between these two metrics and is further enhanced by non-linear transformations like `cube`, `reciprocal`, `tanh`, `log`, and scaling techniques.
- The difference `f5 f10 -` represents another recurring transformation that might capture a critical relationship and is transformed using `sqrt` and `reciprocal`.
- Applying `minmax_scaler` and `std_scaler` helps in normalizing features for model algorithms sensitive to scale.
- Non-linear transformations like `cube`, `reciprocal`, `tanh`, `log` can help model non-linear relationships between variables and outcome.
  
By combining these elements thoughtfully, it is possible to create a more robust feature set that captures both linear and non-linear dependencies in the data, potentially improving the prediction model's performance.

2025-11-07 15:32:50,530 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, I'll create a new set of transformed features that aim to capture potentially useful information for the prediction task. The new feature set considers a mix of scaling, non-linear transformations, and interactions, while avoiding redundancy and capturing a wide range of variance. Here's a proposed new feature set:

```plaintext
[f2, f3, f9, f11, f3 f9 /, f5 f9 /, f11 tanh, f3 quan_trans tanh, f3 f11 *, f11 tanh minmax_scaler, f2 f11 * tanh, f5 square tanh, f11 sqrt, f3 square reciprocal, f11 tanh f2 square /, f3 f11 * cos f9 minmax_scaler *, f5 f9 / f11 tanh tanh *]
```

### Explanation:

- **Direct Features**: Including `f2`, `f3`, `f9`, and `f11` to capture essential input features.
  
- **Divisions**: `f3 f9 /` and `f5 f9 /` are used to account for normalized read and write operations.

- **Non-linear Functions**: Incorporating `tanh`, `sqrt`, `square`, and `cos` as non-linear transformations to capture non-linear patterns.

- **Interactions**: Combining `f3 f11 *` and `f3 f11 * cos f9 minmax_scaler *` to capture interaction terms and linear scaling. These feature interactions might uncover useful joint effects.

- **Scaled non-linear transformations**: Utilizing `minmax_scaler` and `reciprocal` to adjust scales for the non-linearly transformed features.

This feature set is designed to leverage the strengths of both original sets, introducing additional non-linear transformations and interactions, which can be particularly useful when capturing complex relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

**Explanation of Additional Features**:

1. **`f0 f1 + f2 + log`**: This transformation applies the logarithm after summing features `f0`, `f1`, and `f2`. It can help in capturing multiplicative relationships on an additive scale, potentially helping with highly skewed distributions.

2. **`f4 f3 / sqrt`**: Taking the square root of the division between `f4` and `f3` can help in stabilizing variance and improving normality, potentially enhancing the linear relationship in the data.

3. **`f6 f7 * f8 + minmax_scaler`**: The interaction of these three features is scaled to a range, which helps normalize feature variability and enhances the interpretability of the data, especially when dealing with features of different scales or magnitudes.

- Existing and useful transformations like `f9 f5 - square reciprocal`, `f11 cos`, `f3 f9 / minmax_scaler`, and `f11 f10 - sqrt` are retained for their potential to normalize and capture nonlinear interactions.
- Additional transformations with logarithmic transformations (`f8 quan_trans log`), and combinations (`f11 log`, `f2 f8 - cube`) are included to potentially capture effects at different scales.
- Use of `quan_trans` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize features and enhance model performance.
- Complex interactions like `f9 f5 - square reciprocal` are maintained since they were deemed insightful in previous examples.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-11-07 15:33:37,868 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by leveraging the provided examples, we can derive new features that potentially capture more complex interactions and transformations of the original inputs. The goal is to enrich the representations in a way that may be more informative for the predictive task at hand, i.e., predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode.

Taking both sets into account, I'll craft a new feature set that combines ideas from both:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans ,f11 sigmoid ,f11 reciprocal ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f11 tanh ,f11 f11 * ,f0 f1 * log ,f2 f3 f9 + sqrt]
```

Here’s a breakdown of the newly added transformations:
- `f0 f1 * log`: This creates an interaction term between `f0` and `f1`, followed by a log transformation. This can capture multiplicative relationships and then stabilize variance with the log.
- `f2 f3 f9 + sqrt`: It sums up `f2`, `f3`, and `f9`, and then applies a square root transformation. This could highlight an aggregated effect of these features after reducing skewness with the square root transformation.

This new set maintains all the useful transformations from the previous best set and introduces new potential higher order interactions and transformations which may help in capturing underlying patterns in the data.

**Explanation of New Features:**
- `f0 f1 +`: This new feature represents the sum of reads and writes between system memory and user memory, which could capture the overall memory transfer activity.
- `f3 f4 /`: By dividing the number of system read calls by system write calls, this feature captures the ratio of reads to writes, reflecting balance or dominance in IO operations.
- `f6 f7 + f9 *`: This feature is a combined interaction capturing the weighted influence of exec calls and characters written on the process run queue size.
- `f10 f11 * sqrt`: This feature interacts process run queue size with available memory pages and applies a square root transformation, capturing complex relationships between memory availability, process queue, and CPU usage dynamics.

These transformations aim to capture potentially hidden patterns and interactions that might improve the predictive model's performance on the task of predicting CPU user mode time.

Answer: 83.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f9 f5 - square reciprocal]

2025-11-07 15:34:02,000 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set building on the given examples, we can incorporate a few additional transformations that could provide more useful insights for prediction.

Here's the proposed feature set:
```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f9 f5 - square reciprocal ,f11 cos ,f10 tanh ,f3 f4 + sqrt ,f0 f7 / log ,f11 f8 * minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **`f9 f5 - square reciprocal`**: This feature comes from the previous examples and utilizes subtraction, squaring, and taking the reciprocal, which effectively emphasizes the magnitude of `runqsz` relative to `fork`.

2. **`f11 cos`**: Using cosine transformation on `freeswap (f11)` could help capture cyclic patterns or reduce linearity.

3. **`f10 tanh`**: Applying hyperbolic tangent to `freemem (f10)` squashes the input, emphasizing the variation of values at bounds.

4. **`f3 f4 + sqrt`**: Summing `sread (f3)` and `swrite (f4)`, then applying a square root transformation, could effectively measure overall input/output operations and reduce skewness.

5. **`f0 f7 / log`**: Dividing `lread (f0)` by `rchar (f7)` gives a ratio of logical reads to characters read, and taking the log could stabilize variance.

6. **`f11 f8 * minmax_scaler`**: Multiplying `freeswap (f11)` and `wchar (f8)`, then applying min-max scaling, captures the combined effect of available swap space and system write throughput while normalizing the feature for improved comparability.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans, f11 sigmoid, f11 reciprocal, f10 f1 f0 * + log, f4 f3 - sqrt, f7 f8 * sqrt, f6 tanh]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Features (f0 to f11):** Keep the original features as they may provide necessary context.
  
2. **Advanced Features:**
   - **`f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans`:** Retain this transformation from the previous sets as it may capture the interaction complexity among these variables.
   - **`f11 sigmoid`:** Retain the sigmoid of `f11` to capture non-linearity, especially if `f11` has outliers or a wide range.
   - **`f11 reciprocal`:** Retain the reciprocal transform as it can be useful for high magnitude values.
   - **`f10 f1 f0 * + log`:** Log-transformed sum of the product and sum of `f10`, `f1`, and `f0` to handle skewness and magnitudes.
   - **`f4 f3 - sqrt`:** Square root of the difference between `f4` and `f3` to reduce skewness and enhance interpretability.
   - **`f7 f8 * sqrt`:** Square root of the product of `f7` and `f8`; it may capture co-dependency between transferred characters.
   - **`f6 tanh`:** The hyperbolic tangent of `f6` to squash values between -1 and 1, which might help in normalization. 

This proposal introduces non-linear transformations and cross-feature interactions, which could enhance the predictive power for the task of predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode.

2025-11-07 15:34:52,862 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we want to extract meaningful information and include transformations that could improve the prediction capabilities for the target variable (portion of time CPUs run in user mode). It is important to leverage statistical transformations and consider interactions between features that might intuitively relate to CPU usage. Here's a proposed feature set:
```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f2 f11 * f5 + log, f11 sqrt, f3 f7 /, f11 reciprocal tanh]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transformations and Feature Interactions:**
   - Using transformations like `log`, `sqrt`, and `reciprocal` can help normalize skewed data and stabilize variance, potentially leading to better performance of models.
   - The feature `f2 f11 * f5 + log` combines `scall` (f2) and `freeswap` (f11) with `fork` (f5), then takes a logarithm. This captures interaction between system calls and memory available for page swapping, potentially identifying how memory usage combined with calls impacts CPU usage.
   
2. **Simple Transformations:**
   - `f11 sqrt` applies square root to `freeswap` (f11), a common technique to handle large numerical ranges and stabilize variance.
   
3. **Combinations of Features:**
   - `f3 f7 /` divides `sread` (f3) by `rchar` (f7). The relative number of read calls against the amount of data read may provide insight into different patterns of CPU usage.
   
4. **Non-linear Transformations:**
   - Applying `tanh` to the `reciprocal` of `freeswap` (f11) captures non-linear relationships, especially in cases where the effect on the target is not linear.

These transformations and interactions look at combining features and non-linear transformations with potential relevance to CPU usage prediction, adding layers of interaction that can be beneficial for model learning.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

### Explanation of New Features:

- `f0 f1 +`: An interaction term combining the reads and writes between system memory and user memory. This might capture the combined I/O stress on the system.
  
- `f3 f4 * sqrt`: Calculate the square root after multiplying `sread` and `swrite`, which could help in capturing the read-write balance in a less skewed manner.

- `f5 f6 sqrt *`: Incorporating the product of fork and exec after taking the square root can reveal the typical load due to process creation and execution, which affects CPU usage.

- `f7 f8 log +`: Log transformation of characters read and written, combined together. This might help in understanding the log-scale impact of large data transfers on CPU usage.

These new transformations and interactions are aimed to enrich the feature space and potentially capture more complex patterns impacting the CPU usage in user mode.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

These transformations include scaling, non-linear transformations, and interactions between features.

Here's a proposed improved feature set:

```

**Explanation of Additions:**
1. **f10 f10 *:** Captures second-order interactions which might help in understanding nonlinear relationships.
2. **f10 f11 *:** Combines two features to check for interaction effects.
3. **f11 f11 *:** Another second-order interaction term to capture nonlinear effects.
4. **f0 f1 +:** Aggregates related features to potentially reveal cumulative effects.
5. **f3 f4 -:** Difference between features to understand differential impact.
6. **f5 f6 *:** Another interaction term utilizing features related to system calls.
7. **f7 f8 /:** Ratio of two features to capture proportional relationships.
8. **f9 sin, f10 tanh, f11 sigmoid:** Apply non-linear transformations to potentially capture underlying non-linear patterns.

These modifications enhance the feature set by exploring potential non-linear relationships and interactions that may lead to better predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

**Explanation:**

- I have retained transformations from the examples that might capture nonlinear relationships, such as `cube`, `square`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler`.
- Added new transformations:
  - `log` on `f11` to capture multiplicative variances in data like `freeswap`.
  - `cube` on `f1` to see potential high-degree polynomial relations in `lwrite`.
  - `square` on `f3` to emphasize the influence of `sread` values.
  - `sigmoid` on `f9` as a way to capture non-linear squashing effects, useful for queue sizes like `runqsz`.
  - Combined original features (`f6` and `f7` with `+`, `f4` and `f9` with `/`) to explore additive and multiplicative interactions.
  - `tanh` transformation on the product of `f7` and `f8` to map values between -1 and 1, further highlighting interactions in read/write transactions.

This enhanced set retains meaningful complexity and is designed to uncover various patterns that might be useful for predicting CPU user mode time.

### Explanation:
- **New Features:**
  - **`f5 f2 * minmax_scaler`**: This captures interaction between `fork` and `scall` scaled to [0,1]. It could capture the intensity of system calls in terms of fork operations.
  - **`f11 reciprocal`**: This is the reciprocal of `freeswap`, useful for emphasizing smaller values more than larger ones.
  - **`f11 minmax_scaler stand_scaler`**: Applying a min-max scaler followed by a standard scaler helps in normalizing `freeswap`.
  - **`f0 f11 + minmax_scaler` through `f9 f11 + minmax_scaler`**: Capture the sums of each feature with `freeswap` and apply min-max scaling to standardize the range. This accounts for the relative contribution of `freeswap` to each base feature, normalized across its range.

Answer: 83.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f2 f2 quan_trans square cube minmax_scaler * sqrt minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f11 cos ,f10 cube ,f11 reciprocal ,f10 quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans ,f10 reciprocal ,f10 square ,f10 sin]

In this new feature set:
- The application of `tanh` and `log` on f10 helps in scaling and normalizing potentially skewed data.
- Combining features using `+` and weighting them through scaling or normalizing methods can capture interactions between variables.
- The combination `f4 f5 tanh *` adds more depth by capturing the interaction between `sread` and `swrite`.
- The combination `f6 f7 + minmax_scaler` captures interactions between `fork` and `exec` and scales them.

These transformations aim to enhance the feature representation and support better model learning for the task of predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode.

2025-11-07 15:36:58,425 - INFO - llm output = To improve the predictions based on the examples provided, we can create a new feature set by combining useful transformations from both of the given feature sets. The latter example has fewer transformations, but it offers some potentially useful ones, so we will integrate both sets and add more transformations to enhance feature richness.

Here is a new feature set that combines and extends the approaches from your examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, 
f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans, f11 sigmoid, f11 reciprocal,

f2 f3 f4 + + minmax_scaler, f7 f8 / stand_scaler, 
f10 tanh, f3 f5 - sigmoid, f11 f10 / quan_trans]
```

Explanation of additional transformations:

1. `f0 sqrt`: Taking the square root of f0 to capture non-linear relationships.
2. `f11 square`: Squaring f11 to possibly capture variance in larger values.
3. `f8 log`: Applying log transformation to f8 to handle skewed distributions.
4. `f2 f7 * minmax_scaler`: Multiplication of f2 and f7 followed by minmax scaling to combine interaction effects and normalize.
5. `f2 f3 f4 + + minmax_scaler`: Adding f2, f3, and f4 then applying minmax scaling for feature interaction and normalization.
6. `f7 f8 / stand_scaler`: Division of f7 by f8 with standard scaling to control for feature scale.
7. `f10 tanh`: Applying hyperbolic tangent to f10 to manage outliers.
8. `f3 f5 - sigmoid`: Difference between f3 and f5 with sigmoid transformation to reduce extreme values.
9. `f11 f10 / quan_trans`: Ratio of f11 to f10 with quantile transformation to stabilize variance.

These transformations are meant to enhance feature representation and improve model performance by capturing relationships and reducing skewness or variance within the data.

[f0, f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f11, f10, f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans, f11 sigmoid, f11 reciprocal, f11 minmax_scaler, f3 sqrt, f4 log, f5 f10 +, f6 f7 *, f8 f9 /, f11 tanh, f5 f5 *]
```

In this feature set:
- I've retained common elements from both provided sets.
- Introduced new transformations like `sqrt` and `log` for some features to potentially capture non-linear relationships.
- Added combinations (e.g., `f5 f10 +` and `f6 f7 *`) to explore interactions between features.
- Ensured a predictive balance by attempting to capture various statistical properties and potential non-linearities.

Answer: 83.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-11-07 15:37:19,311 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature transformation sets provided, we can attempt to create a better feature set by considering aspects such as normalization, combining features, and using various transformations to capture non-linear relationships.

```

I incorporated a mix of transformations, combinations, and scaling techniques to capture different aspects of the data:
- Used the `quan_trans` for transforming combined features to potentially handle non-normal data better.
- Applied `minmax_scaler` and `reciprocal` to various features to ensure they are within a manageable range and to deal with skewness.
- Used `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `log` transformations to explore non-linear relationships and potentially complex dependencies.
- Combined features using basic arithmetic operations to capture interactions between them.

These transformations aim to capture as much variability as possible and improve predictive performance.

### Explanation:
1. **Base features**: Include all original features (`f0` to `f11`).
2. **Combination and transformation**: Keep the promising combination and transformation `f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans` from the second example.
3. **Normalize key features**: Use `minmax_scaler` on `f11` because normalized freed swap may better indicate memory availability.
4. **Interactive feature**: Create a sum of `f0` and `f1` followed by `minmax_scaler` to capture the overall memory read/write adjusted to a scale, providing a feature representing total memory transactions.
5. **Log transformation**: Apply to each of the system call count features (`f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5`, `f6`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`) to handle variation range and capture exponential growth patterns.
6. **Hyperbolic tangent transformation**: Apply to `f10` (run queue) to smooth out outliers while maintaining the sign and helping in capturing non-linear relationships more effectively.
7. **Reciprocal for crucial insights**: Retain reciprocal transformation on `f11` for illuminating saturated conditions when free swap is low.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-11-07 15:37:35,431 - INFO - llm output = To derive a better feature set, I'll consider the transformations used in both given examples and aim to enhance them. The aim is to maintain diversity in feature transformations, incorporate scaling for normalization, and include a mix of non-linear transformations that could capture complex relationships among the features. Here's an improved feature set:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11,
f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans,

- Introduced operations like `sqrt`, `cube`, `sin`, and `cos` to capture non-linear relationships.
- Included new interactions, squares, and reciprocal functions to capture different relationships.
- More combinations were created by using +, -, *, and /.
- Combined transformations like `minmax_scaler` with arithmetic operations to cover a diverse range of possibilities.

This revised feature set should encapsulate a wider array of transformations and interactions, potentially improving predictive performance on the given dataset.

2025-11-07 15:37:54,477 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, we can observe that the latter set excludes the `f11 minmax_scaler` transformation from the first set. Our goal is to create an improved feature set by learning from these examples. A better feature set might incorporate useful transformations that capture more information without increasing noise. So, I'll propose a feature set that combines ideas from the examples while experimenting with additional transformations that could be beneficial.

Here's the new, potentially better feature set:

```

**Explanation of new transformations:**

- `f10 f5 * stand_scaler`: This combines `f10` and `f5` through multiplication and applies standard scaling, which can help normalize the feature and reduce variance.
- `f11 log`: Applying a logarithmic transformation to `f11` might help in stabilizing variance and making the data more normally distributed. 

This set attempts to balance between leveraging the given transformations and introducing new ones that could enhance predictive power for the target variable.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-11-07 15:38:05,642 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, we want to derive a better feature set by leveraging the transformations used and possibly introducing new insights. The latter example drops the `f11 f11 *` feature, indicating that this might not have been particularly useful. Additionally, both examples use a variety of scaling and transformation techniques to enhance the dataset.

A potential improvement would be to focus on maintaining a balance of transformations that capture non-linearity (like `tanh`, `reciprocal`) and scaling (like `minmax_scaler`) to help normalize the data. We can also introduce some diversity in feature engineering by using new transformations like `log` and `sqrt`, which are often effective with skewed data—particularly when the standard deviation is large, as is the case with several features here.

Here’s a proposed better feature set:

```
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans, f11 sigmoid, f11 reciprocal, f11 minmax_scaler, f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f11 tanh, f11 log, f11 sqrt]
```

Key changes and additions:
- Included `f11 log` to address potential non-linear relationships and help with values that might span several orders of magnitude.
- Added `f11 sqrt` to handle any positive skewness and stabilize variance.
- Retained previous transformations that were consistent in both examples, like `f11 tanh`, which helps in compressing the values to a range between -1 and 1.

This enhanced feature set provides a comprehensive mix of techniques aimed at improving the predictive model's capability by better normalizing and transforming the data.

Specifically, let's consider the transformations revolving around the existing features and how they encompass the original features as well as their combinations or transformations. 

We'll also try to incorporate combinations and transformations that capture scale variations and interactions between features that could be meaningful for modeling the target.

Here's a better feature set, based on the provided ones:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:
- **Existing Features:** We retain core features like `f0` to `f11` as direct input features, as they could be significant independently.
- **Transformations and Interactions:**
  - Retain complex transformations and scalings for `f11` and interaction terms like `f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans`.
  - Added `f0 f1 * sqrt`: This combination and transformation might capture interactions between lread and lwrite.
  - Added `f5 f7 + minmax_scaler`: The combination of `fork` (f5) and `rchar` (f7) scaled could capture simultaneous behavior of process forking and character reads.
  - Added `f8 f9 / log`: This interaction accounts for the ratio of `wchar` (f8) and `runqsz` (f9), which is log-transformed to manage scale diversity.

**Explanation:**

- The original features `f0, f2, ..., f11` are preserved to ensure that basic patterns are not lost.
- The transformations such as `quan_trans`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh` on `f11` are retained to capture possible non-linear effects.
- Squaring `f11` to capture any quadratic effects is also included.
- A log transformation of `f10` was added, as this can help stabilize the variance and normalize the data distribution.
- The product of the square root of `f10` and itself is added to capture a possible interesting interaction or effect of `f10`.
- A feature created by `f2 f0 / log` captures the interaction effect in a different way that could be significant based on the data properties.

These additions aim to enrich the feature set by exploring potential non-linear and interaction effects, which could improve model performance in predicting the CPU's user mode time.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f2 f11 * f5 + log, f11 sqrt, f3 f7 /, f11 reciprocal tanh]

To create a better feature set leveraging these examples, we should aim for a balance of expressive transformations while avoiding excessive complexity. Here's a proposed improved feature set, enhancing pragmatic transformations while maintaining conciseness:

```

```

### Feature Transformation Explanation:
- `f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans`: Quantile transformation to normalize a combined interaction of features.
- `f11 sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation to squash the feature into a bounded range.
- `f11 reciprocal`: Reciprocal transformation for an inverse relationship.
- `f2 f3 * f6 / log`: This transformation leverages an interaction among multiple features, subsequently applying a log transformation for non-linearity.
- `f7 f8 * sqrt`: Interaction between features followed by a square root transformation for potential variance stabilization.

This selection aims to create a rich feature space that captures various relationships and distributions within the data, improving the model's ability to predict the portion of time CPUs run in user mode accurately.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-11-07 15:39:13,638 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations, here's a refined feature set with potentially improved utility for predicting the portion of time the CPUs run in user mode. This new feature set incorporates various transformations, emphasizing scaling, normalization, and nonlinear transformations to capture potential complex relationships:

```

```

### Explanation
1. **Inclusion of Nonlinear Transforms**: 
   - `f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans`: Nonlinear transformation potentially captures complex interactions.
   
2. **Normalization/Standardization**:
   - Several features are scaled using `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` which help in normalizing the data range and centering them respectively.
   
3. **Additional Nonlinear Interactions**:
   - `f3 f2 / sqrt` and `f4 f3 f2 * + sin` introduce interactions between features that might capture combined effects that are not apparent when features are considered independently.

4. **Logarithmic Transformation**:
   - `f10 log` is included for potential normalization of skewed distributions.

These transformations aim to enhance the predictive performance of the model by capturing underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

We'll use feature transformations to attempt to capture more meaningful patterns.

Here's a suggested feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:

1. The original features (`f0` to `f11`) are retained for their raw value contribution.
2. `f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans` captures composite interaction effects between system calls, the available disk blocks, and overall system calls, transformed via quantile transformation to handle non-linear relationships.
3. `f11 sigmoid` applies a sigmoid transformation to `f11`, which is useful for compressing the range of values, possibly dealing with high variability in disk blocks available for page swapping.
4. `f11 reciprocal` provides another transformation of `f11`, capturing effects that might be inversely proportional to its original magnitude.
5. `f11 log` applies a logarithmic transformation to `f11`, which could be helpful for dealing with skewed distributions by compressing large values more than small ones.

These transformations are hypothesized to capture unique and meaningful patterns within the data for improved prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

To create an even better feature set, we can combine the strategies from both examples, integrating a variety of transformations, normalizations, and scaling operations. Here's an improved feature set that leverages a range of transformations:

```

```

### Explanation:
- **Diverse Transformations**: Includes logarithmic, square root, and cube transformations.
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Combines min-max scaling, standard scaling, and quantile transformation for various features.
- **Non-linear Transformations**: Uses `tanh` and `sigmoid` to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Feature Interactions**: Explores interactions between features (e.g., `f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans` and `f0 f1 + sqrt`) to enable more complex modeling.

2025-11-07 15:40:04,208 - INFO - llm output = Here's a new feature set that aims to improve upon the previous examples by including additional transformations and interactions that could capture non-linear relationships and normalize feature scales. The transformations used include a combination of standard scaling, min-max scaling, and non-linear transformations like tanh and reciprocal to handle potentially skewed distributions.

```

- I've kept the original features (f0 to f11) for their baseline importance.
- Added non-linear transformations like `tanh` and `log` to capture potentially non-linear relationships.
- Applied combination operations (`*` and `+`) followed by scaling techniques like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans` to maintain consistent feature ranges.
- Used expressions such as `f5 f6 * tanh` to capture interactive effects between features.
- Introduced a redundancy check for variance preservation with `stand_scaler`, ensuring non-zero means and consistent distribution spread.

2025-11-07 15:40:08,097 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets and aiming to create a better set, we can synthesize a new feature set by combining and optimizing elements from both. Specifically, we'll consider the wide range of transformations applied, such as quantile transformation and min-max scaling, which are very useful for normalizing feature distributions. Additionally, meaningful interaction terms and non-linear transformations, like taking the square root or using the sigmoid function, can capture underlying relationships in the data. 

Here is a synthesized feature set that combines elements from both examples and introduces a couple of additional transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11,
 f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans,
 f11 sigmoid,
 f11 reciprocal,
 f11 minmax_scaler,
 f0 minmax_scaler,
 f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans sqrt,
 f0 f2 + log,
 f4 f6 * sqrt,
 f1 f3 f5 * + tanh,
 f9 f10 / log]
```

This hybrid feature set incorporates:

1. Basic features (`f0` through `f11`) for completeness.
2. Normalization transformations to ensure all features are suitably scaled for modeling.
3. Interaction terms (e.g., `f5 * f11 * f2 +`) to capture complex relationships among features.
4. Non-linear transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `log` to capture potential non-linear relationships.
5. Use of `sigmoid`, `reciprocal`, and `quan_trans` to handle skewed features effectively.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The transformations you provide suggest that adding a variety of scaled and non-linear transformations of the original features can be beneficial. Here is an enhanced feature set:

```

This feature set includes:

- The original features deemed important from previous sets.
- Several transformations such as quantile transformation, sigmoid, reciprocal, tanh, and min-max scaling of multiple features.
- Additional transformations that explore interactions and non-linear transformations:
  - Log of the ratio of `f9` and `f10`.
  - Square root of the product of `f2` and `f6`.
  - Reciprocal of the ratio of `f4` and `f8`.
  - Square and cube transformations for `f7` and `f6`, respectively.
  - Tanh transformation of a new interaction feature (`f5 + f11`).
  - Min-max scaling of a product feature (`f0 * f10`).

These new transformations aim to capture important patterns and interactions among the data features for better prediction of the target variable.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans ,f11 sigmoid ,f11 reciprocal]
 
 
[f0 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans ,f11 sigmoid ,f11 reciprocal ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f11 tanh]

2025-11-07 15:40:56,701 - INFO - llm output = Based on the information you provided and the two new feature set examples, I will suggest a better feature set. We'll aim to create a more enriched and informative feature set by applying additional transformations while retaining the useful ones from the previous examples.

Here's a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f5 f11 f2 * + quan_trans ,f11 sigmoid ,f11 reciprocal ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f11 tanh ,f0 f1 * ,f7 f8 / ,f6 f5 - tanh ,f9 sqrt ,f10 log ,f5 f8 * quan_trans]
```

**Rationale:**

1. **Use of Scaling and Transformation Techniques:** Min-max scaling, quantile transformation, and sigmoid have been applied to existing features to enhance their distribution characteristics.

2. **Combination of Features:** Creating combined features such as multiplications and divisions like `f0 f1 *` and `f7 f8 /` can capture interactions between features.

3. **Non-linear transformations:** Using functions such as `tanh`, `sqrt`, and `log` on specific features might reveal more about the behavior of features towards CPU user mode prediction.

These combinations and transformations will help capture a wide array of patterns and variations in your data, thereby providing potentially better inputs for your prediction model.
