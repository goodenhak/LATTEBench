you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, efforts have been made to leverage division operations and logarithmic transformations, which are typically effective for capturing multiplicative and scale relations. The cubes and reciprocals enhance the ability to capture non-linear relationships. I've chosen combinations to maximize feature interaction diversity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:52:48,250 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set inspired by the two examples you provided, we need to select features and transformations that might be more informative or have higher potential to improve the model's performance. Here is a proposed feature set based on the given examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f22 cube cos ,f0 square ,f7 square ,f14 square ,f26 square ,f24 minmax_scaler ,f13 cos ,f11 f12 + ,f3 f4 *, f1 f5 /, f20 stand_scaler, f24 f7 + sinh]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Selection and Transformation**: 
   - **Cubed and cosine combination (`f22 cube cos`)**: Retained from the last example because trigonometric transformations on cubed values can capture complex patterns.
   - **Squared Features (`f0 square`, `f7 square`, `f14 square`, `f26 square`)**: These are simple nonlinear transformations that can capture quadratic relationships.
   - **Min-Max Scaler on Feature 24 (`f24 minmax_scaler`)**: Normalization can help to equalize the importance of features.
   - **Cosine Transformation (`f13 cos`)**: Retained for capturing periodic relationships.
   - **Addition and Multiplication (`f11 f12 +`, `f3 f4 *`)**: Combining features through addition or multiplication can uncover interactions.
   - **Feature Interaction through Division (`f1 f5 /`)**: Dividing features can also highlight rate-like relationships.
   - **Standard Scaler (`f20 stand_scaler`)**: Used to centralize and normalize features which stabilizes the variance.
   - **Sine Hyperbolic Sum (`f24 f7 + sinh`)**: Using a hyperbolic transformation on the summation of two features to add nonlinear complexity.

This modified feature set combines direct transformations, basic arithmetic operations, and scaling to produce features that capture a range of relationships. When implementing this, be mindful of potential feature correlation and ensure the transformations align with the model's capability to leverage them effectively.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This new feature set combines elements from both example sets:
- It maintains original features for reference.
- It retains and emphasizes the use of sigmoid and quantile transformations.
- Some complex combinations from both sets are integrated.
- It includes strategic combinations that mix different transformations and scalings.
- The use of `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `cos`, and `log` ensures data normalization and non-linearity capture.
- Additional feature combinations are introduced to capture potential nonlinear interactions.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:53:20,585 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature engineering transformations from both sets, I'll propose a third set that combines relevant transformations and adds some diversity for further insights:

```python
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f14 reciprocal, f26 reciprocal, f40 reciprocal, f14 cube, f15 f14 * cube, f23 f14 * reciprocal, f39 f14 * reciprocal, f34 tanh, f0 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f26 stand_scaler, f0 tanh, f7 tanh, f14 tanh, f26 tanh, f1 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f17 sigmoid, f27 sigmoid, f3 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f15 sqrt, f30 sqrt, f14 log, f20 log, f29 log, f24 minmax_scaler, f24 reciprocal, f13 cos]
```

**Explanation:**
- **Reciprocal** transformations are retained for a variety of features to capture inverse relationships.
- **Cube** and **multiplied by cube** transformations capture complex interactions, particularly with `f14`, which might hold significant insights based on its repetitive transformation.
- **Tanh** and **stand_scaler** are maintained for various features to normalize and standardize the data while introducing potential non-linearities.
- **Sigmoid** transformations are added to a few features not heavily transformed by tanh to capture different non-linear characteristics.
- **Sqrt** transformations are introduced to handle any potential skewness in distribution.
- **Log** transformations are used on select features for improved handling of skewness.
- **Minmax_scaler** for rescaling remains for certain features to maintain comparability.
- **Cos** is included for periodicity capture, and **Reciprocal** transformations are consistently applied to varying subsets of features.

This set offers a balanced approach, leveraging a wide array of transformation techniques to capture both linear and non-linear relationships in the data, while focusing on features that have shown or might show deeper underlying patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:53:27,375 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature engineering examples provided, you aim to create a more refined feature set by building on the transformations used in both examples. 

To improve the predictability of the model, I will select key transformations that are likely to capture non-linear relationships, such as cubic and quantum transformations, and feature differences that may unveil interactions between features. Additionally, I'll retain some feature scaling methods to ensure numerical stability, such as sigmoid and reciprocals for transformation ease. Here is a revised feature set:

```plaintext

This revised feature set combines elements from both examples while introducing comprehensive transformations that might uncover latent patterns in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:53:34,669 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature set transformations, I will create a new and improved feature set example. I will incorporate transformations that could potentially improve the model's performance on classifying the chemical compounds into the two classes.

Here's the new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f14 minmax_scaler, f15 minmax_scaler, f30 minmax_scaler, f38 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler cos, f24 cube, f34 cube, f10 log, f17 sqrt, f9 reciprocal]
```

In this new feature set, I've retained previous feature transformations and added new ones to explore potential improvements:
- `f10 log`: Applied the logarithm transformation on feature `f10`, which might help in cases where the distribution of feature values is highly skewed.
- `f17 sqrt`: Applied a square root transformation on `f17` to potentially normalize the feature's distribution if it's right-skewed.
- `f9 reciprocal`: Added a reciprocal transformation of `f9` which can be useful for reducing the impact of large values if the distribution is skewed.

These transformations are chosen as potential methods to normalize skewed distributions and enhance the model's prediction performance. It is essential to validate these transformations through experimentation to ensure they improve model accuracy and generalization.

We'll focus on combining operations like scaling, transformation through mathematical functions, and interaction terms. Here is an enhanced feature set based on the given examples:

```

```

This set integrates the following improvements:
1. Enhanced use of nonlinear transformations (e.g., `tanh`, `sin`, `cos`) combined with scaling methods to capture intricate patterns.
2. Interaction terms between features with operations such as multiplication, addition, or transformations like logarithms, square roots, and others.
3. Usage of combinations of features with operations that can emphasize variation and distribution properties (e.g., `cube`, `square`, `log`).

Incorporating these strategies would aim to provide more diverse and informative features that capture the underlying structure better, ultimately aiding in model performance for prediction tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:
1. Retained unique list of raw features from both sets.
2. Retained complex interactions and transformations from both sets as these may capture interesting dynamics.
3. Added combination of operations from both like `f2 sqrt cos f1 f22 + /` to enhance feature diversity.
4. Incorporated a combination of transforms on `f38` that maximizes complexity and diversity: `f38 quan_trans sigmoid stand_scaler`.
5. Prioritized diversity in types of transformations and interactions from both examples.

This new feature set offers a balance by utilizing a variety of transformations and interactions to potentially capture different aspects of the original dataset for improved model performance.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:53:56,896 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set inspired by the given examples, we aim to combine computational efficiency, minimize redundancy, and maximize interpretability while capturing the characteristics of the data that aid in classification. 

Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f4, f6, f7, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f16, f17, f19, f21, f22, f24, f26, f27, f29, f30, f32, f33, f35, f36, f37, f38, f38 quan_trans sigmoid stand_scaler, f22 cos sigmoid f4 + stand_scaler, f16 cos, f11 quan_trans, f12 quan_trans, f21 quan_trans, f1 cos, f2 cos, f6 cos, f10 cos, f17 cos, f29 cos, f35 cos, f22 f16 + sqrt, f2 f24 /, f3 f24 /, f36 stand_scaler, f37 cube, f0 cube, f0 f40 + f6 + f14 -, f0 f6 f14 - +, f40 f24 /]
```

### Rationale:

1. **Preserve Core Features:** Core features (`f0, f1, ..., f38`) are retained to ensure that the key characteristics of the data are preserved.
  
2. **Feature Combinations and Transformations:**
   - **Tranformations:** Apply transformations such as cosine, quantile transformation, and standard scaling to potentially non-linearly transform features for better separation between classes.
   - **Mathematical Combination**: Combining certain features can capture interaction effects (e.g., `f22 cos sigmoid f4 + stand_scaler`).

3. **Reducing Redundancy:** Avoid repetition of similar operations on features. For example, `f38 quan_trans sigmoid stand_scaler` is an effective combination of transformations.

4. **Feature Operations:** Including operations like division (e.g., `f2 f24 /`) and cube (e.g., `f0 cube`) helps derive meaningful non-linear transformations.

5. **Focus on Computationally Effective Operations:** We used operations like cosine and standard scaling, which are computationally efficient and help in transforming feature distributions for a given task.

This new feature set provides a balance between complexity and interpretability, with emphasis on transformations that aid in classification without introducing unnecessary redundancy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:54:01,713 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using the provided examples as guidance, we can focus on the variety of transformations used, considering non-linear transformations that might reveal more informative patterns in the data. The transformations should also maintain diversity and complexity to capture different aspects of the original features. Here's a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f24 reciprocal sqrt ,f11 tanh ,f12 square ,f21 log ,f27 cos ,f38 tanh ,f0 sin ,f7 sqrt ,f14 tanh ,f26 reciprocal ,f24 cos ,f13 tanh]
```

In this feature set:
- We explore combinations of non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `cos`, and `sin` for potentially non-linear data.
- `sqrt` and `reciprocal` are used for transformations that might linearize heavy-tailed distributions.
- `log` may help stabilize variance and reduce skewness in positively skewed data.
- The `square` transformation can emphasize larger values if that aspect may be significant in the modeling process.

2025-10-01 20:54:05,897 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature set examples, here's a new feature set that could potentially be better than the latter:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f22 cube cos, f0 square, f7 square, f14 square, f26 square, f24 cube, f16 reciprocal sigmoid, f7 sqrt]
```

In this feature set:
- I've retained features from the latter that emphasize transformations likely to capture non-linear relationships (using square and cube operations).
- I've additionally included a `reciprocal` and `sigmoid` combination from the first example on `f16`, which might normalize or highlight certain properties beneficial for the model.
- Introduced `sqrt` on `f7` as an alternative transformation, which can sometimes reveal underlying linearity or subtle patterns.

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Interactions:** 
   - I retained and expanded on interactions like `f0 f14 reciprocal * square` and introduced new ones like `f0 f21 cube *`.
  
2. **Non-linear Transformations:**
   - We employ squares, cubes, and reciprocal transformations, which are useful for capturing complex relationships. Higher-order terms can model interactions and non-linear effects.
   - `f38 square square`, `f21 cube square` are retained to capture higher-degree combinations.

3. **Cosine Transformations:**
   - Selective cosine transformations of features `f34`, `f22`, and `f33` to potentially capture periodic effects or symmetry.

4. **Scaling and Normalization:**
   - Applied standardized transformations such as `minmax_scaler` to help with model convergence and to ensure features are on a similar scale.
  
5. **Combined Transformations:**
   - Feature construction like `f35 f21 + reciprocal sqrt square` and `f0 f34 * square` to combine features linearly and nonlinearly with the power to capture more intricate patterns.

6. **Use of `tanh` and `square sqrt`:**
   - Applied `tanh` to `f12` for squashing input values to a range which might be beneficial for activation functions in certain models.
   - `square sqrt` neutralizes transformations and can serve as a regularizer for certain features.

These changes aim to balance the number of transformations with interpretability and predictive power, creating a feature set that adds potential richness and insight into the downstream classification task of chemical biodegradation.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

```

In this set, I've incorporated additional interactions and transformations such as:
- Multiplying `f4` and `f22`, which might capture interactions between specific molecular descriptors.
- Using a combination of division and addition with `f1`, `f9`, and `f35`, introducing potential nonlinear interactions.
- Applying the `tanh` function on the interaction between `f17` and `f19`.
- Using the `sqrt` function on `f36`, which might capture nonlinear relationships in that feature. 

These transformations can help capture complex patterns in the data and potentially improve classification performance for the given task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

In this feature set, I retained transformations and interactions that appeared useful from both examples while introducing some additional transformations like `log` to handle skewness, division to create interactions, and multiplications/additions to capture combined effects, which may be indicative of complex relationships in the data.

```

### Key Enhancements:
- **Basic transformations like square root** on main features (`f0`, `f7`, `f14`, `f26`) to moderate values.
- **Combination of cubic transformations** on most features along with a selection of combinations (e.g., `f0 f1 +`) to introduce interaction terms.
- **Retention of complex transformations** (`reciprocal sigmoid`, `cosine of cubes`) to explore potential nonlinear relationships or periodic patterns in the data.
- **Additional interaction terms**: Introducing addition for feature interactions that can capture synergies in values which possibly influence the target class.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

```

### Explanation:
- **Diverse Transformations**: The new feature set incorporates various transformations, covering elementary functions (cos, cube, sqrt) and feature scaling (quan_trans, stand_scaler).
- **Advanced Arithmetic Combinations**: It continues leveraging original feature arithmetic combinations to capture interactions between the features.
- **Feature Engineering Techniques**: Incorporates additional non-linear transformations like sigmoid and log to model non-linear relationships, while maintaining the core structure of existing transformations.

This blended approach aims to capture nuanced feature relationships while maintaining computational efficiency and feature diversity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

1. **[f3 f7 /]**: Create a new feature that divides f3 by f7, possibly revealing significant interactions between these features.
   
2. **[f2 f5 *]**: Multiply f2 by f5 to capture any possible interaction effects or synergies between these features.

3. **[f9 f4 + tanh]**: Add f9 and f4, then apply the hyperbolic tangent function to capture nonlinear relationships in a normalized range.

4. **[f19 f35 + log]**: Add f19 and f35, and then apply the logarithm. This can capture multiplicative relationships while normalizing large values.

This new feature set aims to explore various transformations, potentially revealing new insights that could aid in classifying the chemicals based on their biodegradability.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:55:12,215 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and taking into consideration feature engineering techniques that effectively capture non-linear relationships, I am proposing an optimized feature set using various transformations. This set combines both basic transformations and more complex operations such as combinations of operations to enhance the predictive power for the downstream task.

Here's the new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f4, f5, f6, f7, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f16, f17, f21, f22, f24, f26, f27, f29, f30, f32, f33, f35, f36, f38, f40, 
 f24 cube cube, f11 cube, f12 cube, f21 cube, f27 cube, f38 cube, 
 f0 square, f7 square, f14 square, f26 square, 
 f24 f0 - cube, f12 reciprocal, f13 reciprocal, f30 reciprocal, 
 f1 cube cube, f2 cube cube, 
 f24 f7 - cube, f24 f14 - cube, 
 f24 sin, f13 cos, 
 f0 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, f26 quan_trans, 
 f0 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f17 sigmoid, f36 sigmoid, 
 f13 cos, f0 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f26 minmax_scaler, 
 f24 f0 - minmax_scaler, f24 f7 - minmax_scaler, f24 f14 - minmax_scaler, 
 f14 tanh, f27 tanh, f38 tanh, 
 f17 SpMax_L sqrt + f1 tanh + f6 sqrt *]
```

Explanation of the choices:
1. **Combining Basic and Complex Transformations**: The feature set includes cubes of certain features, differences between features processed further by cube operation, and applying reciprocal to certain features that might benefit more by inversely stabilizing them.
2. **Feature Interactions**: I've extended transformations on differences "f24 f0 - cube", among others, to capture interactions between features.
3. **Non-linear Activation Functions**: Usage of `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `cos` to explore potential non-linear relations.
4. **Quantile and Minmax Scaling**: Usage of `quan_trans` and `minmax_scaler` to adjust distribution challenges and maintain numerical stability across certain features.
5. **Final Aggregate Features**: Added composite terms like "f17 SpMax_L sqrt + f1 tanh + f6 sqrt *" which integrate the effects of non-linear transformations and interactions strategically chosen from given attributes.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Features**: Retain original features from examples that capture key information.
2. **Scaling and Normalization**: Use min-max scaling to normalize a few key numeric features.
3. **Transformations**: Employ square, cube, reciprocal, square root, cosine, and hyperbolic transformations to capture non-linear interactions.
4. **Composite Features**: Create complex features through addition and multiplication operations to explore interactions between features.
5. **Avoid Redundancy**: Ensure each transformation and feature combination adds unique information.

By blending and extending these techniques, the new feature set aims to provide more comprehensive inputs for the downstream task and potentially improve model performance through richer feature representation.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this new set:
- I've carried over the promising transformations and added the `log` transformation for `f3`, which can be useful in handling skewed distributions (assuming `f3` is positive in all cases).
- I've introduced a new ratio feature `f12 f10 /` to capture relationships between those particular features.
- I've added `f11 f21 /` as another potential interaction term.
- The `tanh` transformation is used on `f5` to potentially capture non-linear relationships.
- Additionally, I've applied `minmax_scaler` on a previously quantile-transformed `f38` to bring it into a normalized scale, providing stable and potentially more meaningful input to models that are sensitive to the scale of the features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This proposed feature set aims to incorporate various transformations such as square, cube, square root, reciprocal, sine, cosine, and hyperbolic tangent across features, along with combinations of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, I've included a selection of feature transformations involving scaling and quantile transformations to capture distribution differences and potential scaling effects. The use of diverse operations and transformations might help capture complex relationships within the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:55:51,112 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set, let's incorporate insights from both examples to build a robust set that includes a diverse range of transformations. We can leverage the use of squared and cubed transformations, as well as trigonometric and logarithmic transformations, which may capture non-linear relationships in the data. I'll also include some differences between certain features to account for potential interactions or contrasting effects.

Here’s a refined feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,

```

This set retains powerful transformations from both examples and introduces some new mixed feature interactions to capture more complex relationships, potentially enhancing the downstream predictive model's performance. Make sure to evaluate the usefulness of these features with respect to your specific predictive task, as the improvement in model performance will depend on the interactions and relationships within your data.

In this improved set, I've kept a variety of transformations including sigmoids, cosine, division, and feature scaling. I've also added some transformations like `tanh` and `log` which can potentially add non-linearity and improve interpretability. The `cube`, `square`, and `quasi transformations` from the examples are maintained due to their potential to capture cubic and quadratic relationships in the data.

Here's one possible feature set:

```

In this set, I've prioritized using a diverse set of transformations, including cubing and higher-order transformations, combined with trigonometric and nonlinear transformations that capture non-linear interactions and variations. Additionally, I've selectively included the sin and cos transformations, which can be valuable for capturing periodic patterns. The integration of `sigmoid` and `reciprocal` can also help in normalizing and bounding feature distributions. This set aims to capture both complex nonlinear interactions and effective scaling.

f9 f10 /, 
f8 f9 + f10 *, 
f3 f31 + sqrt, 
f19 sqrt, f28 sin, f32 cos
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. I've retained the base features `f0` to `f40` for completeness.
2. Carried forward both square and cube feature transformations from previous examples, retaining the notable features.
3. Added interaction terms like `f24 f0 -` and similar with other features to capture interactions between `f24` and select features.
4. Introduced an additional transformation using trigonometric functions on `f13`, `f32`, to capture cyclic behavior if present.
5. Added reciprocal followed by sigmoid of `f16 reciprocal sigmoid` which is indicative of attempting both linear and non-linear transformations to improve model performance.

This feature set should provide a substantial basis for model improvement, taking into account data distribution, transformation diversity, and feature interaction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

In this set, we mainly:

1. Retain significant unique transformations and features from both examples (e.g., feature subtraction combinations, `cube`, `quan_trans`, `sigmoid`).
2. Enhance the diversity by adding some new operations like `tanh` and `log` on selected features where there might be non-linear relationships beneficial to the classification task.
3. Include higher-order transformations like double `cube` on select features for capturing deeper interactions.
4. Use `reciprocal` and `cos` sparingly on new features to explore non-linear modifications that might reveal hidden patterns for the classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

In this feature set, I included a combination of squares, square roots, reciprocals, cosine transformations, and tanh functions to model non-linear relationships in the data. This integration seems to optimally leverage the available transformations, congruent to dataset variance and potential model assumptions. These transformations were chosen to offer variety without over-complicating the inputs, enhancing nonlinear interpretability and scaling where needed.

This new feature set incorporates useful transformations such as the reciprocal of `f4`, which can often provide meaningful insights when combined with other nonlinear transformations like logarithms. The elements like `f27 sqrt log` and trigonometric transformations add diversity to the feature transformations, making them potentially more informative for modeling.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

1. The new set combines the common elements from both feature sets.
2. For non-common elements:
   - Includes additional transformations that can add new meaningful features derived from the existing ones.
   - Applies different functions such as `sqrt`, `square`, `cos`, and `sin` to potentially reveal hidden patterns.

### Key Enhancements:
1. **Cubic and Reciprocal Transformations**: Retain a wide variety of cubic transformations from both example sets, as polynomial features can capture complex interactions.
2. **Reciprocal and Sigmoid Transformations**: Include reciprocal and sigmoid transformations for some features to handle non-linear relationships and bounded behaviors.
3. **Combination Features**: Leveraged the existing pattern of combining differences (`f24 - f0`) and multiplicative/composite relations (`f30 / f29`, `f33 * f35`) to capture more complex interactions.
4. **Logarithm and Trigonometric Enhancements**: Included logarithmic and sine transformations to capture exponential relationships and periodicity, respectively, within feature sets.
5. **Consistency Across Models**: By keeping transformative operations consistent (like cubic and reciprocal), the feature set will support varying downstream models effectively.

This custom feature set aims at enhancing the robustness of downstream models while maintaining interpretability and ensuring diversity in transformations that can capture complex relationships.

```

This feature set includes:
1. The original features to maintain baseline information.
2. Cubing certain features, as this can often capture complex interactions and transformations that are nonlinear.
3. Applying square roots to some features to handle scaling and spread of values.
4. The use of standardized transformations (`stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`) on selected features, which can be useful for normalizing variations and improving model convergence.
5. Some of the feature interactions such as the subtraction and addition of features which can highlight differences or interactions between feature pairs.
6. Complex transformations such as the combination of `tanh` and `sigmoid`, as well as a `cos` transformation on a reciprocal, potentially capturing periodicity or relationship inverses.

The feature engineering process would typically involve evaluating the contributions of these derived features to the accuracy and performance of predictive models, iterating further based on empirical results.

```

The improved feature set incorporates the better aspects of both previous examples and further introduces additional transformations such as logarithmic, reciprocal, hyperbolic tangent, and square root of sums of certain feature pairs to explore new nonlinear relationships. These newly transformed features can aid in capturing complex patterns within the data, potentially improving classification performance for the downstream task.

2025-10-01 20:57:42,357 - INFO - llm output = To create a more effective feature transformation set, we can combine the valuable aspects of both examples provided, while also possibly introducing some new transformations that capture complex relationships or interactions in the data:

1. **Combining Approaches**: Merge the quantile transformation and sigmoid functions for a robust, non-linear transformation, especially useful for skewed data.
2. **Interaction Features**: Using arithmetic operations to introduce features that are combinations or interactions of two or more existing features.
3. **Advanced Transformations**: Including logarithmic and reciprocal transformations where they can account for non-linear patterns or scale wide-ranging data efficiently.
4. **Normalization and Scaling**: Applying standard scaling to standardize data about the mean and unit variance.

Considering these guidelines, here is a proposed feature transformation set:

]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Features**: Include all original features to ensure no potential information loss.
2. **Sigmoid and Quantile Transformations**: Combine these where they enhance data non-linearly, helping model performance with skewed or non-uniform data distribution.
3. **Cosine and Sigmoid Chains**: Applying two-step transformations adds complex non-linear traits.
4. **Arithmetic Interactions**: The addition and multiplication of certain features that could reveal complex relationships.
5. **Scaling Transformations**: Apply standard scaling and quantile transformation for normalization.
6. **Reciprocal and Log Transformations**: Use for certain features to potentially linearize exponential growth trends or compress scales.
7. **Square and Cube Enhancements**: For potential exposure of non-linear traits in data relationships. 

This comprehensive set of transformations seeks to optimize model interpretability, prediction accuracy, and variability handling in the modified feature space.

### Explanation:

1. **Base Features**: All original features are kept, ensuring that the foundational data inputs are preserved for the model's use.

2. **Sigmoid Transformations**: The sigmoid transformations of significant features end in `[sigmoid]` to capture non-linear transformations. This pattern is inspired by the first two feature sets.

3. **Quantile Transformations**: Quantile transformations are applied to f11, f12, f21, and f38 variables, followed by sigmoid, to use distribution-based normalization and nonlinear activation.

4. **Cosine Transformations**: Use cosine followed by sigmoid to create potentially beneficial non-linear periodic transformations on selective features like f1, f4, f6, f10, f17, and f22.

5. **Square Transformations**: Expand square transformations based on set size to more features to evaluate polynomial effects. 

6. **Log Transformations**: Applied to starting features f0-f5, to potentially convert multiplicative effects into additive equivalents in the dataset.

7. **Standard Scaler**: Features f0, f15, f16, f23, and f24 have a centered mean and unit variance to capture normalized data relationships.

8. **Tanh Transformations**: Tanh is applied to f7, f14, f30, and f31 as another non-linear activation function.

9. **Sqrt, Cube, and Reciprocal Transformations**: Added elements like f2 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f4 cube, f25 cube, etc., to provide varying dynamics and capture skewness.

This engineered feature set aims to balance the complexity of transformations applied to the data with maintaining a robust spectrum of non-linear transformations.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:58:02,926 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we should focus on including diverse transformations and combinations that could capture complex relationships and potentially improve prediction performance. The second example you provided uses a wider variety of transformations, including multiple cubes, squares, reciprocal transformations, and the `quan_trans` for quantile transformation, which often helps in normalizing distributions. Therefore, I'll incorporate similar transformations but with more combinations for potential predictive power, as well as include new transformations like square root and sine operations to explore additional non-linear relationships. Here's an enhanced feature set:

 f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40,

 f7 f16 + sigmoid, 
 f17 sqrt, 
 f36 cos,
 f5 f6 + square,
 f38 cube,
 f11 cube,
 f40 cos cos]
```

Here's a breakdown of some specific transformations included:
1. Simple cubes and squares to capture non-linear relationships.
2. Use of `-`, `+` operations to explore interactions and differences between selected features.
3. `sqrt`, `quan_trans`, and `sigmoid` as different transformations that can help with non-linearity and normalization.
4. Introducing function compositions, like `f7 quan_trans` and `f0 sigmoid`, to experiment with normalizing and smoothing effects.

The choice of transformations is intended to introduce non-linearities, capture potential interactions, and make the data distribution more suitable for downstream modeling tasks without over-complicating the feature space.
