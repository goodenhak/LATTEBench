you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:45:25,351 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature set examples, let's create a new feature set by selecting and transforming features from both sets. We aim to improve the downstream prediction task by creating potentially more informative features while combining the effective transformations from each example.

New Transformed Feature Set:
```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 f6 tanh / ,f16 cos ,f6 f6 - ,f16 tanh ,f0 sin ,f1 sin ,f7 sin ,f9 sin ,f10 sin ,f13 sin ,f19 sin ,f6 f16 / f0 - f0 - ,f6 f16 / f0 - f8 sigmoid - ,f15 sigmoid ,f15 f16 * ,f6 cube]
```

Explanation:
1. Retained the basic features `[f0, f1, ..., f20]`, as both sets suggest using a broad range of raw features.
2. Used `f9 f6 tanh /`, `f16 cos`, `f6 f6 -`, `f16 tanh`, and `f0 sin` transformations, leveraging both cosine and hyperbolic tangent transformations known for capturing non-linearities.
3. Selected sinusoidal transformations from the second set (`f1 sin`, `f7 sin`, `f9 sin`, `f10 sin`, `f13 sin`, `f19 sin`) which capture periodic patterns.
4. From both sets, included sigmoid-derived transformations and multiplication operations, such as `f6 f16 / f0 - f0 -`, `f6 f16 / f0 - f8 sigmoid -`, `f15 sigmoid`, and `f15 f16 *`, to introduce non-linear complexity.
5. Added the `f6 cube` transformation as a new complex feature to account for higher-order interactions.

This new set aims to cover a diverse range of transformations and interactions, potentially improving the predictive power by effectively capturing complex patterns and non-linear relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's a new proposed feature set:

```

```

### Justification:

- **Basic Features**: Start with all raw features for baseline modeling support.
- **Feature Interactions**: Added interactions using multiplication, addition, and subtraction to explore interactions between various features.
- **Non-linear Transformations**: Applied transformations like `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `square`, `cos`, and `sin` to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Scalers and Normalization**: Utilized `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize feature values, making them suitable for models sensitive to scale.
- **Statistical and Mathematical Transformations**: Used operations like `log`, `reciprocal`, `sqrt`, and `cube` to uncover latent patterns.

Overall, the new feature set attempts to balance basic inclusion, interaction effects, and non-linear transformations, aiming to capture a wide range of complex patterns relevant for defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:45:57,918 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, we want to generate a new, potentially more informative feature set for defect prediction. We want to ensure that we enhance interpretability and capture complex feature interactions. Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f1 f3 * f4 + ,f12 tanh ,f15 minmax_scaler ,f9 f17 + sqrt]
```

Explanation:

1. **Include basic features:** Retain all original features (`f0` to `f20`) to maintain the original information.
2. **Interact complexities and operands:** Combine `f1`, `f3`, and `f4` by multiplication and addition to explore interactions between different complexities.
3. **Non-linear transformations:**
   - Apply `tanh` to `f12` to handle potential non-linear relationships and capture variance.
   - Use `minmax_scaler` on `f15` to normalize the feature for better comparability across features.
   - Sum `f9` and `f17` and then apply `sqrt` to potentially stabilize variance and scale down values.
4. **Incorporate diverse transformations:** A variety of transformations (add, multiply, nonlinear functions) are used to capture complex interactions which might be helpful in separating defect-prone modules from non-defect-prone ones.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-10-01 20:46:10,745 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the provided feature sets, I'll integrate and enhance features with additional transformations that can uncover hidden patterns and relationships important for defect prediction. Here is the enhanced feature set:

```

In this enhanced feature set, I've included additional transformations and composite features, such as:

1. **Log and Sqrt Transformations**: Applied `log` and `sqrt` on existing interactions to potentially capture multiplicative relationships.
2. **Tanh Transformation**: Applied `tanh` on selected features to handle possible nonlinear relationships.
3. **Feature Ratios**: Introduced interactions involving divisions to explore relative scales, such as `f0 f18 /`.
4. **Feature Compositions**: Used combinations and interactions with multiple operations, such as `f0 f8 f18 * /`, to capture complex relationships.
5. **Exp Transformation**: Applied exponential transformation to emphasize differences in magnitude, which can be useful for highly dispersed data.
6. **Normalization**: Included standardized and min-max scaled versions of existing composite features, such as `f6 f11 * stand_scaler`.

These feature transformations aim to capture more intricate patterns and relationships in the underlying defects prediction task, which could lead to improved predictive performance.

Let's utilize the transformations and combinations of features highlighted in each example and incorporate some advanced operations for feature transformation:

- We have utilized a variety of transformations including `sin`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` to capture complex relationships and nonlinearities.
- We have combined features with different operations such as addition and multiplication to explore interactions between features.
- Features are min-max scaled where necessary to ensure they are within a similar range for models sensitive to feature scales.
- Advanced transformations are applied to identify potential patterns in the data, such as `log` and `cos`.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:46:24,353 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and transformations, we want to craft a new feature set that takes advantage of complex transformations while retaining components from both examples. The transformations that tend to enrich features with additional non-linearity (e.g., trigonometric functions, tanh, cube, square, sqrt, min-max scaling) and normalize or regularize them (e.g., division by a cube, added scaling) are useful for encoding feature interactions and distributions.

Here is a new improved feature set:

```
[f0, f8, f9, f11, f12, f17, f18,
 f8 f11 square + f9 cube /,
 f16 f8 + minmax_scaler f11 square + f9 cube /,
 f11 tanh f11 square + f9 cube /,
 f19 minmax_scaler square f11 square + f9 cube /,
 f8 minmax_scaler f11 square + f9 cube /,
 f7 f15 * f9 cube /,
 f19 minmax_scaler f11 square + f9 cos /,
 f8 cos sqrt,
 f9 cos sqrt,
 f9 f9 cube / f16 f8 + minmax_scaler f11 square + f9 cube / +,
 f0 cos sqrt,
 f8 f11 square + f9 cube / f19 minmax_scaler square f11 square + f9 cube / +,

 f9 sin f8 cos sqrt /,
 f9 sin f9 cos sqrt /,
 f9 f9 cube / f19 minmax_scaler square f11 square + f9 cube / sqrt tanh +,
 f5 cos sqrt]
```

This evolved feature set incorporates the complexity of operations like `cube`, `square`, `minmax_scaler`, `cos`, `sin`, and `sqrt` to further emphasize any inherent non-linearity between original features. It also combines information using arithmetic operations, division, and tanh, which together may help with normalization and emphasizing feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2025-10-01 20:46:30,433 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature set examples, the second set has additional derived features that potentially capture more complex relationships between the original features. Building on this, here is a new feature set that further enhances the feature engineering by introducing additional transformations:

This new feature set introduces transformations such as reciprocal multiplication, addition with logarithm, and scaling, while retaining useful transformations from the previous examples. These transformations might capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features that could be beneficial for model performance in the context of defect prediction.

2025-10-01 20:46:37,273 - INFO - llm output = When creating a new feature set based on provided examples, it's important to consider creating features that could capture interactions, non-linear transformations, or standardized metrics. Here's an improved set drawing inspiration from the given feature sets while considering complexity and potential predictive power:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10 cube, f6 log, f8 sqrt, f5 f4 /, f6 f3 -, f7 f9 *, f5 f10 /, f4 f2 +, f6 stand_scaler, f11 minmax_scaler, f8 tanh, f10 log, f7 reciprocal, f0 f6 +, f2 f8 *, f5 f10 sqrt /, f8 f9 cube +, f3 f6 -, f4 f1 cos +, f10 sqrt f0 +, f10 reciprocal f2 +, f8 f5 * f6 +, f3 f9 / f7 +, f4 sqrt f5 cube -]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Selection**: Basic features (e.g., f0, f1, ..., f10) are retained to maintain basic information.
2. **Non-Linear Transformations**: Non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `log`, and `reciprocal` are applied to certain features to capture non-linear relationships.
3. **Combinations and Interactions**: Interactions between features are introduced (e.g., `f4 f2 +`, `f7 f9 *`, and `f8 f5 * f6 +`) to capture potential synergistic effects.
4. **Standardization and Scaling**: Features are standardized or scaled (using `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`) to make them better fit for algorithms sensitive to scale.
5. **Complex Operations**: Complex operations involving combinations and transformations (e.g., `f5 f10 sqrt /`, `f3 f9 / f7 +`) are included to explore more complex patterns.

This improved feature set aims to combine existing valuable transformations with more diverse and potentially informative interactions, which might enhance the model's ability to capture underlying patterns in the data and improve prediction accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Let's enhance this approach by introducing more feature interactions and additional transformations while maintaining the format.

Here is a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,

```

In this feature set:

- I have continued using `minmax_scaler` as a common normalization step for certain features.
- I have introduced more interactions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between various features, enhancing the potential to capture complex relationships.
- To ensure robustness, I added operations on a diverse group of features, covering different aspects of the original dataset dimensions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2025-10-01 20:46:54,700 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, I will create a better feature set by combining elements and transformations in a way that should potentially enhance the predictive power for the downstream task.

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f7 f15 + stand_scaler, f16 tanh, f9 f9 cube / f0 + f18 * cube, f17 f19 * sqrt]
```

In this feature set:
- `f7 f15 + stand_scaler` comes from the second feature set, it means summing features 7 and 15 and then applying a standard scaler to it, potentially capturing a new interaction between these two features.
- `f16 tanh` is from the first feature set, capturing a non-linear transformation of feature 16 using the hyperbolic tangent function.
- `f9 f9 cube / f0 + f18 * cube` is taken directly from the first feature set, providing a complex interaction that combines multiple operations.
- `f17 f19 * sqrt` is added as a new transformation, multiplying features 17 and 19 together and taking the square root to potentially unveil non-linear relationships between these features. 

This combination of transformations aims to enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns and interactions between the original features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation of new features:
- `f19 f6 tanh +`: This feature captures the non-linear interaction between `f19` and `f6`, which could reveal intricate dependencies related to software defects.
- `f16 f9 / sigmoid`: This feature is designed to normalize the division of `f16` and `f9` with a scaler that highlights mild relationships possibly missed by linear models. Applying the sigmoid function could enhance modeling relevant interactions.

This new feature set incorporates some of the transformations and combinations from both examples you provided while introducing a few additional transformations such as `cos` and `tanh` to potentially capture different aspects of the data. It maintains the use of quantile transformations, preserving the non-linear relationships, and incorporates a variety of mathematical transformations to hopefully improve the predictive ability of the model.

Here's a feature set that attempts to capitalize on the strengths of both previous examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 f9 cube / f0 + f18 * cube ,f9 f9 cube / f0 + f17 * cos * ,f9 f9 cube / f0 + f5 sin * ,f9 f9 cube / f0 + f9 f9 cube / f6 + * ,f11 f8 minmax_scaler tanh f9 cube / * ,f15 minmax_scaler ,f16 tanh ,f16 sigmoid ,f15 square ,f16 f6 *]
```

In this new feature set:
- I've retained the complex, higher order interactions involving `f9` (a feature that is transformed through repeated operations, such as cubing and division, followed by addition and multiplication with other features).
- I've combined these interactions with nonlinear transformations like `cos`, `sin`, and `tanh` to introduce non-linearity and potential to capture complex patterns.
- Preserving the min-max scaling of `f15` and joint transformations (like `f11 f8 minmax_scaler tanh f9 cube / *`) from earlier examples for robust feature scaling and to possibly highlight relationships that may contribute to better model performance.
- I included standalone transformations like squaring `f15` and using `sigmoid` on `f16`, which seem to capture beneficial individual patterns.
- Retained simple combination products like `f16 f6 *` to account for linear interactions that may be useful.

These transformations are chosen to potentially enhance the predictive ability by leveraging both linear and nonlinear relationships within the data, while scaling them appropriately for model digestion.

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 f6 tanh /, f16 cos, f15 sin, f6 f16 /, f15 f6 *, f6 cos]
```

I have included transformations such as `f9 f6 tanh /`, `f16 cos`, `f15 sin`, which leverage potential non-linear relationships. Additionally, combining features as `f6 f16 /`, `f15 f6 *`, `f6 cos` could uncover interactions between variables. These chosen transformations could help enhance the predictive power of the model for detecting software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a refined and enhanced feature set:

```

In this enhanced feature set:
- I've retained and expanded the use of `minmax_scaler` to facilitate scaling and make comparisons between different feature combinations.
- Added interactions and mathematical operations that might capture more complex relationships by using logarithmic and square root transformations.
- Derived additional scaled interactions to potentially uncover nonlinear relationships important to defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:47:45,755 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided examples, we can create a new set of features that builds upon the complexity and usefulness of transformations in the second set while ensuring they are informative for the downstream task:

```

```

Explanation:
1. I took inspiration from the complex transformations of the second set while removing redundant operations and creating more targeted interactions between features.
2. Crafted combinations like `f9 f9 cube / f0 + f8 f9 cube / *` for potential interaction insights.
3. Added non-linear transformations such as `sin`, `cos`, and `tanh` which often capture interesting patterns.
4. Used `stand_scaler` and `sigmoid` transformations to ensure certain features have more interpretable ranges.

These new features should help improve the predictions by focusing on meaningful interactions and transformations with a balanced complexity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:47:58,014 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given transformation techniques and insights from the previous feature sets, here's a potentially better feature set with some improvements and new transformations:

```plaintext

f17 quan_trans, f6 log, f7 sqrt, f10 reciprocal, f14 cube, f6 f20 / f17 /]
```

### Key changes and additions:

1. **Transformed Interactions**: Retained interaction terms of `f15` with several features to capture potential non-linear relationships.
   
2. **Descriptive Transformations**:
   - Added `f6 tanh` as a transformation to model saturation effects.
   - Retained `f6 stand_scaler` for normalization.
   - Added `f6 log`, `f7 sqrt`, and `f10 reciprocal` to account for potential scale and distribution effects.
   - Included `f14 cube` to explore cubic effects which might reveal higher-order relationships.

3. **Complex Non-linear Transformations**:
   - Retained sophisticated transformations like `f16 sin` and `f0 f18 + sigmoid sqrt` which can capture periodic and capped effects.
   
4. **Divisions**:
   - Added division for `f6 f20 / f17 /` to see interactions involving `f20` and `f17`, which may capture some unique relationships.

These additional transformations and interactions are aimed at capturing diverse potential patterns and relationships in the data, enhancing model flexibility and expressiveness for defect prediction. However, it's always important to validate these feature engineering choices using appropriate cross-validation and model evaluation techniques to ensure they contribute positively to the prediction performance.

```

### Explanation:
- I incorporated nonlinear transformations like `quan_trans`, `tanh`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `cube` to capture complex relationships within the data.
- Aggregated features using both multiplication, addition, and subtraction to potentially highlight interactions between features.
- Used transformations such as `quan_trans`, `stand_scaler`, and `reciprocal` to standardize or invert feature distributions and manage the effect of extreme values.

Ensure when implementing this feature set to evaluate its predictive performance and adjust accordingly based on validation metrics.

Examining the provided transformations in both sets, it appears that complex interactions involving cube operations, additions, min-max scaling, sigmoid, and tanh are potentially useful transformations that capture non-linear relationships and combine various interactions. The latter example introduces more intricate combinations and potentially explores deeper interactions among existing features.

Using these insights, here is a proposed transformed feature set aiming to incorporate and extend these interactions:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

f16 f16 +,
f5 f8 * f4 cube /,

```

This new feature set introduces a combination of element-wise operations, including non-linear transformations like cube roots, scaling, trigonometric operations, and sigmoidal transforms. The interactions are intensified by incorporating these operations to harness potentially intricate patterns and non-linear relationships, aiming for better predictive capabilities.

2025-10-01 20:48:33,108 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature engineering transformations provided in the examples, we need to create a new feature set that potentially provides better predictive power for the defect prediction task. Let's focus on creating complex combinations that leverage various transformations to capture nuanced patterns in the data.

Here is a proposed feature set:

``` 
[f0 ,f5 ,f8 ,f3 f4 *,f3 f7 *,f6 f15 -,f8 f4 *,f11 f0 *,f5 f16 *,f5 f8 *,f7 f9 *,f10 f13 *,f11 f15 *,f16 f4 *,f3 f4 + reciprocal ,f7 f9 + reciprocal ,f19 f0 + reciprocal ,f11 square f3 + reciprocal ,f11 square f15 + reciprocal ,f3 f12 + tanh ,f5 f6 + tanh ,f8 f6 + tanh ,f7 f10 + tanh ,f11 f14 + tanh ,f11 f5 + tanh ,f11 f8 + tanh ,f0 f5 + square ,f0 f15 + square ,f4 f15 + square ,f7 f13 + square ,f8 f3 - f8 + ,f15 f3 - f15 + ,f8 f7 sqrt ,f6 f9 sigmoid ,f5 f15 minmax_scaler ,f6 f4 cube sqrt sqrt]
```

Explanation of the feature set:
- Complex interactions between various original features using multiplication and addition.
- Use of reciprocal, tanh, square, and sigmoid transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Carefully selected feature differences for potential new insights (e.g., `f8 f3 - f8 +`).
- Transformations like `minmax_scaler`, `cube`, and `sqrt` to adjust the distribution or scale of features for better model input handling.

This feature set utilizes various transformation techniques to uncover potentially meaningful interactions and nonlinear patterns, leveraging the combined power of arithmetic operations and nonlinear transformations.

### Explanation
1. **Preserving Core Features**: I kept the core feature references from the dataset which are common in both feature sets.
   
2. **Scaled and Transformed Features**: Retained useful transformations like `minmax_scaler` from the first feature set and transformations involving operations like `quan_trans` and `cube` from the second feature set to capture non-linear relationships.

3. **Combination of Features**: Included combinations and transformations such as `f6 f20 * f6 f1 * - quan_trans quan_trans f11 * cube`, enhancing complexity modeling beyond simple scaling.

4. **Complex Interactions**: Introduced interactions such as `f16 f0 f5 + + minmax_scaler` and `f18 f3 f5 * * minmax_scaler`, capturing intricate relationships among critical variables.

This enhanced feature set aims to retain potentially significant features from both examples while introducing complex interactions and transformations that may improve model performance by capturing a more nuanced feature space.

2025-10-01 20:48:47,822 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and operations, we can create a new, potentially more effective feature set by leveraging transformations that could capture new aspects of the data. Additionally, the transformations should avoid redundancy and enhance the model's ability to discern patterns that contribute to the prediction of software defects.

### New Feature Set:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 f6 tanh / ,f16 cos ,f15 sin ,f6 f6 - ,f5 f4 / ,f7 log]
```

### Explanation:

1. **\[f5 f4 /\]:** This feature calculates the ratio of 'Halstead volume' to 'Halstead total operators + operands'. Ratios can help in quantifying relationships between different parts of the code complexity which might be relevant to defect generation.

2. **\[f7 log\]:** Applying a logarithmic transformation to 'Halstead difficulty' can be useful for mitigating the influence of large values and potentially highlighting multiplicative relationships between features which may be non-linear in nature.

This combination of transformations and synthetic features could help uncover new patterns that are indicative of software defects, improving the predictive performance of the model on this task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

To further enhance feature engineering, we can focus on leveraging complex interactions and nonlinear transformations that could capture hidden patterns more effectively for the defect prediction task. Here's an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

This feature set retains the broad use of the `tanh` transformation to normalize various features, similar to the second example. It also includes complex interactions and transformations such as `quan_trans`, `reciprocal`, and combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to capture non-linear relationships. Additionally, I've added new interactions at the end, utilizing combinations and transformations of multiple features (e.g., `f11 f6 + f8 *`) to create a richer feature space.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:
- **`f20 f19 *`**: Retained from the second example as a useful compound feature indicative of combining two related features.
- **`f6 tanh`**: Kept as a non-linear transformation from the second example to capture potential non-linear relationships.
- **`f9 f6 tanh /`**: Retained from the first example as a division of transformed features that might offer a unique scaling.
- **`f15 sin f16 cos +`**: Combines sinusoidal transformations from the first example, potentially capturing cyclic or periodic nature from the features, and adding them together might provide insights into their relationship.
- **`f14 f13 minmax_scaler *`**: Introduces a multiplication of a minmax-scaled feature to amplify specific scaled properties between `f14` and `f13`, possibly exploring joint interactions under a normalized scale.

```plaintext
[f0, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f6 f20 * f6 f1 * - tanh, f16 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f18 stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler, f20 stand_scaler, f0 cos, f1 cos, f5 cos, f7 cos, f8 cos, f9 cos, f11 cos, f12 cos, f17 cos, f18 cos, f19 cos, f6 f20 * f6 f1 * - tanh sqrt, f7 cos sqrt stand_scaler]
```

In this improved feature set:

1. More advanced transformations like `tanh` and `cos` are applied to the features, which could potentially reveal non-linear relationships in the data.

2. The use of various scaling techniques (`minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`) across different features can help in normalizing the data, which is especially important when different features have vastly different ranges and scales.

3. A combination of transformations such as `tanh` and `sqrt` is explored to create potentially more informative composite features.

4. The feature set maintains complexity without overly complicating the transformations, striking a balance between generating new insights and maintaining interpretability.

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f6 f20 * f10 + sigmoid ]
```

Explanation:
- I use the multiplication of `f6` and `f20` and add `f10`, which might capture interaction effects between Halstead's 'intelligence' and `branchCount` with another feature like Halstead's 'time estimator'.
- I then apply the `sigmoid` function to squash the result between 0 and 1, which is helpful for non-linear modeling and classification tasks, as it maps the input into a bounded range. This might help in capturing interactions in a more interpretable fashion and could be particularly valuable if the response variable follows a logistic/bernoulli process.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:49:40,931 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set combining both examples you provided, I'll consider keeping the transformations present in each set and potentially adding a new feature transformation that could enhance predictive power. Both examples use transformations like `tanh`, `cos`, `sigmoid`, and multiplication. Here's a new, enhanced feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f20 f19 * ,f6 tanh ,f15 sigmoid, f9 f6 tanh / ,f16 cos, f0 f6 sqrt *]
```

This new feature set:

1. Retains the original features `f0` to `f20`.
2. Includes the product of `f20` and `f19` and the `tanh` transformation of `f6` from the second example.
3. Keeps the division of `tanh(f9)` by `f6` and the `cos` of `f16` from the first example.
4. Adds a new feature: the product of the square root of `f0` and `f6`, which combines a transformation (`sqrt`) that could capture additional variance or interactions between features likely reflecting on software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here are the considerations for this improved feature set:
- Retained basic features (f0, f1, ..., f20) as they are essential input for constructing transformed features.
- Included normalization and transformation techniques such as `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler` to improve model stability and convergence.
- Added multiple nonlinear transformations: `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `cube`, `square` to capture complex relationships.
- Employed feature interactions like `f15 f16 +` and products (`f15 f0 *`, etc.) to augment the feature space and potentially capture interactions between features.
- Included mathematical operations such as `log`, `sigmoid`, and combined transformations like `f0 f18 + sigmoid sigmoid sqrt` to capture nonlinear relationships.

In this feature set, I've retained the more complex transformations from the examples given, like the quantile transforms and standard scaling, while also incorporating sinusoidal and hyperbolic functions which might capture non-linear relationships effectively. Additionally, I've included an extra squared and cubed interaction feature combined with a hyperbolic tangent to introduce even more non-linearity. This combination aims to create a robust feature set potentially beneficial for enhancing the model's predictive capabilities concerning software defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Retained Original Features**: 
   - The set includes all original features `[f0, f1, ..., f20]` because each may have unique contributions.
  
2. **Incorporated a Logarithmic Transformation**:
   - The first transformation feature is `f6 f20 * f11 + log`, which uses a logarithmic transformation on the combination of the product of `f6` and `f20` added to `f11`. Logarithmic transformations can be useful to reduce skewness and manage differences in scale between features.

3. **Square Root Transformation**:
   - The second transformation feature is `f6 f20 + f11 + sqrt`, which calculates the square root of a linear combination of `f6`, `f20`, and `f11`. This emphasizes smaller values while diminishing the impact of outliers.
  
These new features aim to enhance the representation of the data to potentially improve prediction accuracy by leveraging non-linear relationships and more compact scaling of values.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 f9 cube / f0 + f18 * cube ,f15 minmax_scaler ,f16 tanh ,f16 sigmoid]

2025-10-01 20:50:11,976 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two new feature set examples provided and the instructions to create a better feature set, here is a single improved feature set representation using postfix expressions:

``` 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 f9 cube / f0 + f18 * cube, f15 minmax_scaler, f16 tanh, f16 sigmoid, f17 sqrt]
```

In this improved feature set, I've included `f16 sigmoid` from the first example and the addition of `f17 sqrt`, which can help capture non-linearity or potentially important transformations of feature `f17`. Since this feature set also retains all the original features and transformations, it aims to maximize the potential of capturing relevant patterns for the downstream task.
