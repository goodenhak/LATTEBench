In the given examples, we see a progression from basic reciprocal and sigmoid transformations to more varied tanh and interaction terms. Let's introduce some new transformations and interactions to potentially enhance predictive power:

```
[f0, f3, f6, f7, f8, f0 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f0 sigmoid, f3 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f7 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f0 tanh, f3 tanh, f6 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f0 reciprocal tanh, f0 f3 *, f6 f0 *, f7 f8 *, f6 f3 log, f8 f6 sqrt]
```

Here's the breakdown of the added features:
- **Interaction Terms**: `f0 f3 *`, `f6 f0 *`, `f7 f8 *`—these interactions between features might capture complex relationships.
- **Logarithmic Transformation**: `f6 f3 log`—log transformations are useful for managing skewed data and can provide insights into multiplicative relationships.
- **Square Root Transformation**: `f8 f6 sqrt`—useful for adjusting variance; it can also provide a linearizing effect for certain types of distributions.

By introducing a mixture of transformations, including interaction terms and adding some polynomial components, this feature set aims to capture more complex relationships and improve prediction accuracy.

2025-11-07 15:43:24,590 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we can experiment with combining different transformations and interactions of features. The goal is to produce features that may capture more intricate relationships in the data, which could potentially improve the downstream task performance (predicting the diamond's price).

Here's a new feature set:

```

```

In this feature set:
- I've included basic transformations like log, sqrt, and cube, which can capture various non-linear relationships.
- Interactions such as products (f0 f2 *), sums (f4 f5 +), and differences (f0 f7 * f6 -) are considered.
- I've applied scaling methods, such as `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler`, to some interactions, which can help in stabilizing the results when using certain machine learning algorithms, particularly those sensitive to feature scales.
- Special care is taken when applying divisions and logs to avoid undefined or unstable computations (e.g., `f4 / max(1, f8)` ensures no division by zero). 

These transformations and interactions may help uncover latent relationships that are not immediately apparent from the raw features alone, potentially leading to better predictive performance.

2025-11-07 15:43:29,188 - INFO - llm output = Creating effective feature transformations can significantly enhance the predictive power of machine learning models. Based on the techniques and examples provided, I'd propose a new feature set that combines ideas and transformations from both of the examples you've given, albeit with refinements for potential improvement:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f0 sin square ,f1 quan_trans ,f0 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f4 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f7 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f2 tanh ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f0 cube ,f0 reciprocal sin ,f0 f3 - sin ,f0 f8 - tanh ,f0 cube f0 reciprocal stand_scaler ,f1 f5 + stand_scaler ,f3 f7 + *,f6 f0 + reciprocal]

```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Feature Transformation Variety:** The new set integrates multiple transformation types like `sin`, `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, and `stand_scaler`, which can help in capturing complex, non-linear patterns within the data. 

2. **Combining Features with + and *:** Features that add or multiply different attributes can capture interactions between those features, providing potentially valuable insights.

3. **Using Reciprocal and Cube:** Reciprocal transformations can help manage skewness in features, while cubic transformations can capture higher-order interactions.

4. **Inclusion of All Original Features:** All original features are included as base features to ensure that no information is dropped from the dataset.

5. **Transformation Sequence:** By combining transformations like `stand_scaler` and `cube`, the transformations capture a rich set of interactions among the base features.

6. **Novel Combinations:** Adding novel combinations such as `f0 f3 - sin` can capture interactions between features with respect to their difference, potentially revealing insights into competitive or complementary relationships.

With this feature set, the goal is to improve the model's ability to learn from and predict based on nuanced patterns within the dataset.

Let's enhance the feature set further.

Here's a new transformed feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:
1. **Scaling**:
   - `f0 minmax_scaler`: Apply Min-Max scaling to `f0`.
   - `f1 stand_scaler`: Apply Standard scaling to `f1`.

2. **Transformation**:
   - `f2 cos`: Apply cosine transformation to `f2`.
   - `f3 tanh`: Apply hyperbolic tangent transformation to `f3`.
   - `f4 log`: Apply logarithmic transformation to `f4`.
   - `f5 reciprocal`: Apply reciprocal transformation to `f5`.
   - `f6 sqrt`: Apply square root transformation to `f6`.

3. **Power Transformation**:
   - `f7 square`: Square `f7`.
   - `f8 cube`: Cube `f8`.

4. **Combination Features**:
   - `f0 f1 *`: Multiply features `f0` and `f1`.
   - `f2 f3 /`: Divide `f2` by `f3`.
   - `f4 f5 -`: Subtract `f5` from `f4`.
   - `f6 f7 +`: Add `f6` and `f7`.

These transformations and combinations aim to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the original features for potentially better predictions.

```

### Explanation of the Transformations:

1. **`f0 minmax_scaler`**: Apply Min-Max scaling to the `carat` to compress its range between 0 and 1, emphasizing relative sizes.
   
2. **`f1 stand_scaler`**: Standardize the `cut` feature which might have been encoded numerically, enhancing its comparability and impact on the model.

3. **`f2 cos`**: Use the cosine transformation on `color` which can help in capturing non-linearities.

4. **`f1 square`**: Squaring the `cut` can help emphasize its effect, assuming some levels of cut have non-linear impacts on price.

5. **`f2 cube`**: Cubing `color` to accentuate variation, especially assuming color variations have a significant, non-linear influence.

6. **`f3 reciprocal`**: Applying a reciprocal transform on `clarity`, potentially converting that into a more linear relationship with price if it's inversely proportional.

7. **`f7 sigmoid`**: Use a sigmoid transformation on `y`, which can help scale the effect of dimensions to a range between 0 and 1, providing a bounded value restraint.

8. **`f8 sqrt`**: Taking the square root of `z` to handle positivity and potentially stabilize variance.

9. **`f4 log`**: Apply a logarithm on `depth` to reduce skewness and handle exponential growth patterns.

10. **`f0 f2 *`: Combine `carat` and `color` multiplicatively, representing interaction that might affect the diamond's value.

11. **`f5 f6 + f3 *`: Multiply `table` by combined dimensions of `x` and `z`, capturing interaction in diamond shape and proportion.

12. **`f4 f0 f1 * +`: A complex interaction term blending `depth`, `carat`, and `cut`, representing collective effects on perceived value.

These engineered features aim to capture interactions and non-linear relationships in the attributes, potentially improving the prediction of diamond prices. The combinations make an assumption of meaningful interactions between these features in the context of diamond valuation.

### Explanation:

1. **`f0 quan_trans quan_trans`**: This applies quantile transformation twice, potentially making the distribution more normal-like and amplifying its effect.
   
2. **`f0 f2 *`**: Interaction term that multiplies carat with the sine transformation of color, which can help capture complex relationships.

3. **`f1 quan_trans`**: Applies a quantile transformation to cut, potentially normalizing its distribution.

4. **`f0 f1 /`**: Division of carat by cut, to observe the relationship between carat weights and cut quality.

5. **`f3 log`**: Log transformation of clarity to stabilize variance and make the data conform more closely to a normal distribution.

6. **`f4 sqrt`**: Square root transformation of depth, which can help reduce skewness.

7. **`f0 f4 /`**: Division of carat by depth, creating a ratio which may predict price better.

8. **`f5 f7 /`**: Ratio of table to y, possibly capturing geometric interactions.

9. **`f6 f8 +`**: Interaction term by adding x and z, capturing potential volume-like aspects.

10. **`f3 f4 +`**: Adding clarity and depth to create an interaction term.

By implementing a diverse set of transformations and interactions across these features, we are likely enhancing the model's ability to pick up on non-linear and complex patterns in the diamond pricing data.

- The existing features from the previous set are preserved and enhanced with additional transformations.
- Applied `sqrt` and `log` to handle skewness and power relationships.
- Used `reciprocal` where division is involved to capture inverse relationships.
- Added `cube` transformation to capture non-linear cubic relationships.
- `stand_scaler` is used to standardize newly generated features for potentially better model convergence.

These transformations aim to provide a richer feature space, capturing potential non-linearities and interactions that may contribute to better predictive performance.

- `f1 square`: Emphasizes the contribution of `f1` at larger values.
- `f2 cube`: Enhances non-linear patterns and emphasizes larger values even more strongly.
- `f3 log`: A common transformation for skewed data, which can normalize the distribution of `f3`.
- `f4 sqrt`: Another transformation that can be useful for normalization purposes.
- `f5 reciprocal`: Inverse transformation, ideal for variables where higher values inversely relate to the target.
- `f6 minmax_scaler`: Normalizes `f6` to be between 0 and 1, maintaining relative relationships.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f0 quan_trans quan_trans ,f1 quan_trans ,f2 sin ,f1 square ,f2 cube ,f1 f1 -, f0 f1 *, f3 log ,f4 sqrt ,f0 f4 /, f5 f7 /, f6 f8 +, f3 f4 +, f0 f1 f2 * *, f3 f5 +, f7 f8 -]
```

This improved feature set not only retains various non-linear transformations and interactions but also includes new combinations that could help capture complex relationships in the data. The selection leverages foundational operations while utilizing scaling and transformation techniques to explore potentially informative feature spaces.

- Interaction terms like `f0 f1 f2 * *` and `f0 f1 f3 * /` capture nonlinear relationships between multiple features, potentially revealing complex interactions that affect the price.
- Combining various non-linear transformations on single features or groups of features such as `f2 f4 f5 cube * *` and `f0 cube` explores underlying properties that might affect pricing.
- Using mathematical functions like `sqrt`, `log`, and `reciprocal` helps normalize and potentially linearize nonlinear relationships, making them better suited for models.
- Statistical transformations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are applied to adjust feature scales, which can improve model stability and convergence.

By creatively combining transformations, we aim to provide robust inputs for predicting diamond prices more accurately.

   - Added new interactions `f3 f6 * sqrt`, `f7 f8 * sqrt`.
3. **Log transformations**: Applied to specific features, capturing multiplicative relationships.
4. **Tanh transformations**: To handle possible nonlinear relationships and saturations.
5. **Squared transformations**: Additional squared terms for features `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` to capture higher-order relationships.

These transformations enrich the feature space and potentially capture more intricate patterns that could enhance predictive performance.

```

Explanation:
- The use of `cube` enhances the non-linear transformation potential, considering `carat` (f0) to the third power could reflect more exponential growth in diamond pricing.
- Combining `cube` with other transformations like `log`, `reciprocal`, `tanh` and `cos` provides rich interaction terms and sufficiently explores non-linear relationships.
- The additional scaled features (`stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`) create normalized versions of the `carat` feature after it is cubed, possibly reflecting polynomial interactions in the dataset.
- Retaining some simple operations from previous set examples (`f1 f2 *`, `f3 f4 /`, `f5 f6 +`, and `f7 f8 -`) ensures capturing combinations of non-linear relationships between the diamond attributes.

- `f1 sqrt`: Taking the square root of `cut`'s encoded numerical representation can help stabilize variance.
- `f2 cube`: Cubing the `color` feature after encoding might provide better sensitivity to changes impacting price.
- `f4 tanh`, `f5 tanh`: Using the tanh function on `clarity` and `table` can help handle outliers by squashing values into a smaller range.
- `f0 f6 / log`: Combining `carat` and `x` with a logarithm transformation can reveal multiplicative interactions between size features that affect price.

Explanation of selected transformations:

1. **Interaction Terms:** Creating interaction terms like `f0 f1 *` and `f2 f5 * f3 +` can capture relationships between features.

2. **Complex Non-linear Transformations:** Using `cube`, `log`, and `tanh` transforms can introduce non-linear perspectives needed for capturing complex feature interactions.

3. **Scaling & Normalization:** Applying `minmax_scaler` ensures features are on similar scales, aiding models that are sensitive to feature scaling.

4. **Combination of Logistic & Reciprocal:** Applying `log`, `sqrt`, and `reciprocal` together provides various perspectives on the feature distributions.

This feature engineering can lead to richer representations potentially improving the model's ability to predict diamond prices effectively.

I'll create composite features, apply non-linear transformations, and employ different scalers. Here's a transformed feature set based on the examples provided:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8,

 f3 f5 - sigmoid, 
 f7 f8 * sqrt minmax_scaler,
 f0 f5 + f6 square,
 f2 f8 * cube reciprocal,
 f1 f7 * tanh stand_scaler]
```

This feature set mixes various transformations to capture different relationships within the data:

- `stand_scaler`: Standard scaling is applied to make feature distributions closer to a normal distribution.
- `quan_trans`: Quantile transformation to reduce the impact of outliers.
- `log`: Logarithmic transformation for positive skew adjustment.
- `reciprocal`: Useful for transforming values especially when they are positive.
- `cube`, `square`: Non-linear transformations to capture polynomial relationships.
- `sigmoid`: Used to squash values between 0 and 1, which can be useful for modeling probabilities.
- `tanh`: Like sigmoid but output ranges from -1 to 1, which can capture features with differing polarities.
- `minmax_scaler`: Rescales features between 0 and 1, providing uniformity across diverse features.

This design aims to explore both linear and non-linear interactions, improve scale variability, and potentially capture complex relationships that influence diamond pricing more accurately.

Here's a brief explanation of the improvements:

1. **Scaling and Normalization**: `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are used for scaling features such as `f0` and `f1`, which might need normalization due to differing range and units.
   
2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Advanced mathematical transformations like `log`, `cube`, `square`, `sin`, and `cos` are included to capture potential nonlinear relationships.

3. **Feature Interactions**: Interaction terms such as `f0 f1 *`, `f0 f1 f2 * +`, and others are added to capture the interaction between features which can be especially useful for capturing relationships that aren't apparent with individual features.

4. **Complex Feature Combinations**: Combining multiple operations such as `f2 cube sqrt` or `f2 f3 f4 f5 + * /` to capture deep interactions between the features.

This set should provide a richer feature space for downstream modeling, potentially leading to more accurate predictions for diamond prices.

Task: This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. Predict the diamond's price in US dollars.

Features:
- carat: weight of the diamond (numerical), range = [0.2, 5.01], Q1 = 0.4, Median = 0.7, Q3 = 1.04, Mean = 0.7976, Std = 0.4778
- cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal) (categorical), categories = [Very Good, Good, Ideal, Premium, Fair]
- color: diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best) (categorical), categories = [E, G, D, F, H, I, J]
- clarity: a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)) (categorical), categories = [VS1, SI1, SI2, IF, VVS1, VS2, VVS2, I1]
- depth: total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (numerical), range = [43.0, 79.0], Q1 = 61.1, Median = 61.8, Q3 = 62.5, Mean = 61.7529, Std = 1.4266
- table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point (numerical), range = [43.0, 95.0], Q1 = 56.0, Median = 57.0, Q3 = 59.0, Mean = 57.4493, Std = 2.2296
- x: length in mm (numerical), range = [0.0, 10.74], Q1 = 4.71, Median = 5.69, Q3 = 6.54, Mean = 5.7277, Std = 1.1272
- y: width in mm (numerical), range = [0.0, 31.8], Q1 = 4.72, Median = 5.7, Q3 = 6.54, Mean = 5.7308, Std = 1.1280

Data Examples:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
