2025-09-30 11:53:47,069 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two provided examples, I will aim to incorporate a mixture of transformations and interactions that capture complex relationships between features. Additionally, I'll apply scaling and nonlinear transformations where suitable to improve the expressiveness and predictiveness of the features. Here's an enhanced feature set:

```

Key Enhancements:

- **Use of tanh and reciprocal transformations:** These nonlinear transformations can model complex relationships and help in bounding features which might have high variance or skew.
- **Interaction terms:** Creating interaction terms such as `f8 f5 * tanh` allows capturing relationships between `f8` and `f5`, which could be relevant for predicting software defects.
- **Mix of transformations:** Including reciprocal, sigmoid, and tanh alongside standard scaling gives a diverse range of feature transformations that can enhance model performance.
- **Scaling:** Min-max scaling at the end ensures that features are within a similar range, which is crucial for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.
- **Removed redundant operations:** Simplified feature set by removing overlapping transformations to improve focus on meaningful interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-30 11:53:55,127 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two provided examples, we should aim to incorporate transformations and combinations of features that capture underlying patterns while maintaining complexity in a manageable way. Here's a newly proposed feature set that builds upon and improves the previous two examples provided:

```plaintext
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f17, f19, f11 cube, f16 cube, f11 f5 f19 - quan_trans + cube, f9 sigmoid f0 square - f19 - quan_trans f5 f19 - quan_trans + cube, f11 reciprocal, f19 sin, f11 square, f11 cube sin, f5 cube sin, (f9 f7 +) f10 / , f9 square f19 cube tanh *, f11 square cube, f11 f8 minmax_scaler f5 f19 - quan_trans + cube *, (f18 sin f5 sin +) f0 square - f19 - quan_trans f8 + f5 f19 - quan_trans + cube cos, (f5 log f11 log +) f16 tanh +, f9 sin f19 tanh + (f11 reciprocal), f10 square f11 square sin +, (f8 sigmoid f5 sigmoid + cube), f12 cos, f18 tanh, f19 tanh, f11 sigmoid]
```

**Key Enhancements:**
1. **Combinational Logic:** Combined features such as `(f9 f7 +) f10 /` and `f9 square f19 cube tanh *` leverage both basic arithmetic and non-linear transformation to capture complex patterns.
2. **Balanced Transformations:** Uses reciprocal, square, cube, sin, tanh, and sigmoid selectively on different features for non-linear approximation while making sure not to over-complicate or over-transform every feature.
3. **Feature Aggregation:** Includes aggregation of features using addition and multiplication to reduce dimensionality and get meaningful pattern cohesion.
4. **Feature Stacking:** Combines results of minmax scaling, quantization, and other transformations in feature interactions, such as `(f11 f8 minmax_scaler f5 f19 - quan_trans + cube *)`, which helps in capturing the spread and variance at a combined level.
5. **Diverse Functions:** Maintained a diverse mix of functions like `cube`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `log`, `sigmoid`—each with specific potential advantages for pattern recognition.

These combinations should provide rich feature interdependencies and transformations that potentially capture more relevant patterns in the defect prediction task.

2025-09-30 11:54:04,058 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set, we'll consider the given feature sets and combine useful operations and feature transformations to potentially enhance the prediction quality. I'll aim to include impactful feature transformations and operations while also considering complexity and interpretability.

Here's a new, improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

Explanation:

- Selected core features from the original set considering potential relevance.
- Constructed meaningful deviations and differences like `f11 f5 - f7 -` which may capture defect indicators.
- Used reciprocal and tanh transformations for handling non-linear relationships.
- Leveraged operations like addition, subtraction, and division to aid interaction terms.
- Focused on transformations around frequently notable features like `f11` (Halstead 'effort') and `f5` (Halstead 'volume') for insightful interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:54:15,246 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and operations, let's create a new feature set that combines some beneficial transformations while potentially enhancing the predictive power. Consider diverse types of transformations and additions based on the original example feature sets provided:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f6, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f17, f18, f7 cube, f6 quan_trans, f9 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f18 sqrt, f5 log, f6 log, f8 log, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f4 reciprocal, f18 reciprocal, f5 tanh, f9 tanh, f13 tanh, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f11 minmax_scaler, f18 minmax_scaler, f0 cube f2 +, f4 cube f8 +, f6 cube f18 +, f7 cube f6 +, f0 minmax_scaler f5 tanh +, f9 tanh f18 reciprocal +] 

In this new set, some interesting transformations include:
- Applying cube transformation to selected features like f7 which might be nonlinear in nature.
- Utilizing square root transformations on f9, f11, and f18 to perhaps normalize skewness or change distribution scales.
- Employing reciprocal transformations and logarithmic scaling to manage potentially skewed numerical features.
- Using tanh on f5, f9, and f13 to manage scale while preserving order and structure. Tan functions are useful to handle outlier impacts in some cases.
- Standard and minmax scaling on features to ensure they are on a similar scale, favoring the modeling algorithms.

These transformations, combined with existing features, aim to enhance the learning capability of predictive models by offering alternative perspectives on data distributions and inter-feature relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this new feature set:
- Emphasis is placed on combining transformations like `quan_trans` and `minmax_scaler` for normalization and standardization.
- Non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `cos`, and `sin` are leveraged for capturing complex relationships.
- Composite terms involving squares, cubes, and arithmetic combinations have been included to further capture non-linear interactions.
- Strategic use of arithmetical operations and function compositions can uncover hidden patterns related to defect prediction.

Here, I've selected a combination of operations and feature interactions, such as additions, multiplications, and unary transformations (e.g., sqrt, tanh, reciprocal). Scaling techniques (e.g., minmax, sigmoid) are applied to balance value ranges, especially effective for neural networks. Non-linear transformations (e.g., tanh, cos, sin) are included to capture potential complex patterns that linear models might miss. This diverse set aims to enhance model learning by increasing the feature space with variants likely to capture important patterns relevant to defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2025-09-30 11:54:48,488 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples you provided, I will create a new, improved feature set that combines elements from both and incorporates different operations to enhance prediction capabilities. I'll focus on leveraging transformations and combinations that could capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

Here is the improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

```

In this revised set:
- I've introduced operations like `cube`, `tanh`, and `log` with `sqrt` on some features to explore more interactions and non-linearity.
- Combined features to explore potential interactions, using operations such as addition followed by `sqrt`.
- Retained commonly used transformations such as `sigmoid` and `square` which were present in both original feature sets.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2025-09-30 11:54:53,908 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples you've provided, the latter example makes use of `quan_trans` and `sigmoid` transformations in combination, which often helps to scale and normalize features effectively. However, the first example has a broader range of transformed features, suggesting it may capture more intricate interactions between them. To create a better feature set using both examples, we can incorporate a wide range of feature transformations and combine impactful transformations from both examples while maintaining the simplicity of the latter. Here's a proposed set:

```plaintext

This set of features combines the straightforward transformations and normalization techniques alongside more complex interactions and transformations to capture a wide array of potentially useful signals for predictive tasks.

2025-09-30 11:55:05,152 - INFO - llm output = Creating a better feature set based on the given examples involves a combination of the existing transformation techniques and potentially introducing new interactions or transformations that may enhance predictive performance. Here’s an optimized feature set based on the provided examples:

```plaintext

```

**Explanation**:

1. **Scaling and Normalization**: Applying `minmax_scaler` to features ensures they are on the same scale, which is beneficial when features are fed into machine learning models sensitive to the scale of data.

2. **Non-linear Transformation**: 
   - `tanh`, `log`, and `sqrt` transformations are introduced for non-linearity, which can capture complex relationships within the data.
   - Combining features with `cube` enables capturing higher-degree polynomial relationships.

3. **Interaction Terms**: 
   - Combining features using `-` and additional transformations like `cube` can capture interactions between features.

4. **Combining Transformations**:
    - Multiple transformations are applied to interaction terms to create complex features that may better capture the underlying structure of the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:55:18,471 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set representation based on the two given sets of transformed features, we want to focus on combining elements that capture the interactions between the original features and perform operations that could enhance the model's ability to distinguish between defective and non-defective modules. Considering both feature sets, we can create a more sophisticated transformation leveraging advanced operations like normalization, interaction terms, and non-linear transformations.

Here is a new feature set that combines the ideas and improves upon the two provided examples:

```plaintext
[f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f2 f9 - ,f2 f11 - ,f5 f17 - ,f8 f15 - ,f10 f6 - + ,f11 f6 - + ,f8 f11 f5 - - f11 f5 - f7 - - ,f7 f11 f5 - - f8 f11 f5 - - ,f3 f9 - f9 f3 - - f8 f11 f5 - - f11 f5 - f7 - - ,f9 f3 - f9 f11 f15 - f7 f11 f5 - - - ,f9 f10 - f11 f5 - - ,f9 f11 f15 - f8 f11 f5 - - + ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f12 sqrt ,f4 f6 - cos ,f3 f9 - minmax_scaler ,f5 f6 - cos f5 f6 - ,f7 f6 - tanh ,f6 f17 - / ]
```

Explanation:
- Retained simpler differences that emulate direct feature relationships, e.g., `f2 f9 -` and `f2 f11 -`.
- Included interactions like `f8 f11 f5 - - f11 f5 - f7 - -`, which capture the interaction within a subset of features, showing potential complex relationships.
- Used `minmax_scaler` and `sqrt` transformations on `f12` to normalize and reduce skewness while maintaining interpretability.
- Incorporated trigonometric transformations `cos`, `tanh` to potentially capture periodic patterns or non-linear relation structures.
- Utilized combination transformations, providing non-linear and scaled insights, e.g., `f9 f10 - f11 f5 - -` and `f5 f6 - cos f5 f6 -`.
- Kept components like `f4 f6 - cos` and `f6 f17 - /` that were also present in the second set for emphasizing complexity and diversity of feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, I've harnessed transformations that could capture non-linear relationships and scalable differences, such as using operations like `cube`, `sqrt`, and `tanh`. The use of operations such as `quantile_transform`, `minmax_scaler`, and `stand_scaler` are intended to normalize data where useful to improve convergence in models and potentially highlight extreme values or scale differences among features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:55:31,483 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, let's aim to create an improved feature set by incorporating elements that could enhance the predictive power for the software defect prediction task. The second example uses various cosine transformations, which could help capture periodic properties in the data, while the first example applies a range of transformations like quadratic, quantile transformation, tanh, sigmoid, and pairwise differences.

Here's a new feature set that attempts to balance these approaches and introduce diversity:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 square ,f1 / f2 ,f3 f9 - sqrt ,f4 f11 - log ,f5 f18 - tanh ,f6 f3 / sigmoid ,f7 f10 - ,f8 f15 * ,f14 f9 - ,f2 f18 / ,f11 f0 - ,f16 quan_trans]
```

In this feature set:
- Added combinations like `f0 square` to capture non-linear effects.
- Included division with `f1 / f2` to capture proportional relationships.
- Used `sqrt`, `log`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` transformations for specific interactions suggested in the previous sets.
- Constructed new features by combining existing ones with subtraction and multiplication operations.
- Retained `quan_trans` for `f16`, emphasizing adjustment for variability within the data.

This diverse and strategically transformed feature set can help in capturing various underlying patterns related to software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's why these transformations and combinations were chosen:
- Enhanced transformation with the inclusion of `tanh` and extra scaling methods to potentially capture non-linear relationships.
- Added complex mathematical operations to leverage potential interactions between features that may uncover hidden patterns.
- Combined the insight gained from both examples to build a diverse set of highly transformed features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

[f4 ,f5 ,f8 ,f9 ,f12 ,f13 ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 f1 + ,f5 f3 + ,f6 f2 + ,f9 f3 + ,f10 f7 + ,f11 f4 + ,f12 f4 + ,f13 f5 + ,f16 f8 + ,f17 f15 + ,f18 f9 + ,f19 f9 + ,f20 f1 + ,f2 f3 * ,f4 f5 * ,f7 f8 * ,f10 f11 * ,f12 f13 * ,f15 f16 * ,f17 f18 * ,f19 f20 * ,f1 f2 / ,f3 f4 / ,f5 f6 / ,f7 f8 / ,f9 f10 / ,f11 f12 / ,f13 f14 / ,f15 f16 / ,f17 f18 / ,f19 f20 / ,f5 f8 f9 * + log ,f10 f7 f3 / + sqrt ,f5 f18 - tanh ,f2 f9 - quan_trans ]
```

The new feature set includes:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, *, /) on various combinations of the original features to capture interactions.
- Non-linear transformations like square and combinations to explore quadratic relationships.
- More complex operations like `log`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `quan_trans` used on combinations to introduce non-linearities and manage scale.
- An example leveraging complex transformations like `log`, `sqrt` along with linear transformations to form new useful features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a new feature set by synthesizing the given examples:

```

Here are some improvements and modifications made:
- Introduced non-linear transformations such as `cube` and `square`.
- Applied `sqrt`, `log`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `reciprocal` to uncover potential non-linear relationships.
- Used `minmax_scaler` to normalize differences that may capture relative importance.
- Combined initial features and their transformations to enrich the feature set further.

2025-09-30 11:56:07,454 - INFO - llm output = Creating a better feature set for software defect prediction involves selecting and transforming features in a way that maximizes predictive accuracy and relevance for the downstream task. Considering the given examples, the latter set emphasizes feature differences and mathematical transformation for potentially capturing complex relationships.

To improve upon these examples, we can combine transformations like scaling, trigonometric functions, and interaction/difference terms to capture more nuanced patterns in the data. Here's a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 , f1 , f4 , f5 , f7 , f8 , f9 , f10 , f11 , f17 , f18 , f19 , f7 reciprocal , f16 minmax_scaler , f16 cos , f5 sigmoid , f11 sigmoid , f12 sigmoid , f14 sigmoid , f19 sigmoid , f8 tanh , f11 tanh , f9 sqrt , f10 sqrt , f2 f5 - cos , f3 f9 - tanh , f4 f8 - sqrt, f5 f11 - tanh , f11 cube , f7 f0 f15 - - , f11 f3 - f0 f15 - - , f9 f3 - f0 f15 - - , f18 f19 - cos, f20 f11 - ]
```

**Explanation of Feature Engineering Decisions:**
1. **Scaling and Transformation:** 
   - Apply `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` on certain features to normalize data for improved model convergence.
   - Utilize `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `cos` on selected features to allow nonlinear transformations capturing complex relationships. 
   - Use `sqrt` and `cube` to incorporate nonlinear trend in the features.

2. **Interaction Terms:**
   - Subtraction of various Halstead and McCabe metrics (e.g., `f2 f5 - cos`) to capture their relative impact and interaction in potentially contributing to software defects.
   - Combining these interactions with further transformations (`tanh`, `sqrt`, `cos`) to capture higher-order relationships.

3. **Reciprocal Transformation:**
   - Employ `reciprocal` on complexity metrics for stability in modeling, particularly for features known to have wide variance.

These engineered features aim to capture subtle patterns and relationships in the software metrics that might correlate with defect prevalence, providing a more nuanced input for predictive modeling tasks.

In this improved feature set, I've added:
- `f12 square sqrt sin`: a composition of operations on `f12` to explore its non-linear effects and interactions in a new dimension.
- `f7 f11 tanh`: takes advantage of combined feature interactions through a hyperbolic tangent to capture potential non-linear relationships.
- `f9 f20 * tanh`: explores the interaction between `f9` and `f20` by multiplying them and applying the `tanh` function to extract non-linear characteristics. 

These additions aim to create more complex feature transformations that could potentially better distinguish between modules with and without defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-30 11:56:24,745 - INFO - llm output = To provide a better feature set based on the two given examples, we'll aim to simplify and improve the representational power of the features. Let's use transformations that often yield more interpretable or effective features for predictive models:

- Use the `quan_trans` and `sigmoid` transformations for non-linear scaling.
- Include basic arithmetic or combinations of features that could intuitively be associated with the defect predictions.

Here's a proposed new feature set:

```

This feature set includes a combination of the elements from both previous examples and introduces logarithmic, reciprocal, and squaring transformations, as well as standard scaling for potentially more robust defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The new feature set introduces more transformations, including `square`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `log`, and `cube`. These choices are aimed at enhancing feature interactions that are potentially non-linear, as well as ensuring normalization in the context of small scale values. We attempt to experiment with combinations that can generalize better by tackling different aspects of the data distribution.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

 ```

**Innovations and rationale:**

1. **Standard Scaler and Additional Trigonometric Functions:** Apply `stand_scaler` on f11, and introduce `cos` transformations on selected features alongside `sin`. This might capture periodic elements or emphasize the relative scaling of values.

2. **Reciprocal Transformation:** Introduce reciprocal transformations with meaningful combinations; these transformations can sometimes highlight inverse relationships or scale imbalances.

3. **Cubing of Products:** Include cube transformations on select interactions to potentially capture higher-order interactions more vividly.

4. **Increased Square Interactions:** Amplified interactions by squaring some transformations, aiming to capture nonlinear effects that squared terms often highlight.

Overall, these adjustments aim to enhance representational capacity and capture intricate relationships potentially predictive of software defects.

2025-09-30 11:57:06,943 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature set transformations, we can observe different transformation techniques being applied, such as basic arithmetic operations, quantile transformation, sigmoid, minmax scaling, tanh, and combinations of these operations.

The first feature set concludes with a single transformation that uses quantile transformation followed by sigmoid, indicating a simpler approach focused on a particular composite feature.

The second feature set, however, explores a broader variety of interactions by examining differences between multiple pairs of features and applying additional transformations such as square and combinations of transformations using addition and multiplication.

To construct a potentially better feature set, we'll aim to combine these insights by including a variety of interactions and transformations, while also incorporating some complexity in the form of combinations and scaling. Here's the proposed feature set:

This proposed feature set takes combinations and transformations into account, while also ensuring a comprehensive interaction between multiple features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

We can incorporate more non-linear transformations and combine features in a way that could enhance the predictive power. Here is an optimized feature set following the given format:

```

```

### Explanation:

1. **Added Features**: 
   - Included f13, f15, and directly added f19 for increased dimensionality.
   
2. **Feature Combinations**:
   - Combined `f7` and `f8` followed by `+`, enhancing interaction terms using both `cube` and `sqrt`.
   - Involved intermediate features in transformations to increase complexity (`quant_trans` and `log`).

3. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - Incorporated `tanh` and `log` transformations to capture non-linear patterns.

4. **Improved Interaction Combinations**:
   - Used transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, which can potentially better capture the data's distribution nuances.

The feature set is enriched with a mix of transformations and interactions focused on potential important patterns capturing more complex relationships within the input space.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

```

**Explanation:**

- Basic feature set retains the original features (`f0` to `f20`), ensuring the model has access to raw data.
- Applied `cos` transformation to the first few features (`f0` to `f5`), focusing on non-linear interactions similar to example 1.
- Added `sqrt` transformations to the features (`f7` to `f11`). Square root often handles non-linear relationships and reduces scale for skewed data, enhancing stability and interpretability.
- Created differences like `f2 f9 -` and `f5 f18 -`, which appear in example 2, capturing interactions that measure deviation among features.
- Implemented additional non-linear transformations (`cos` and `tanh`) on these differences to explore various scales and impacts, which might be useful to capture complexities in defect predictions.
- Introduced further `sqrt` transformations on differences (`f2 f9 sqrt`, `f5 f18 sqrt`) as they might reveal improved interactions, considering the nature of scale adjustments in defect predictions.

These transformations represent a variety of structural adjustments in the dataset designed to optimize predictive modeling possibilities.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's a new feature set by combining elements from both examples and adding potential enhancements:

```
[f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f11, f7 stand_scaler, f0 f16 +, f3 f16 +, f4 f16 +, f8 f16 +, f9 f16 +, f12 f16 +, f17 f16 +, f18 f16 +, f19 f16 +, f8 sin, f11 sin, f18 sin, f6 square, f7 square, f10 square, f11 square, f12 square, f18 square, f4 f16 + square, f9 f3 *, f9 f4 *, f9 f5 *, f9 f7 *, f9 f8 *, f9 f11 *, f9 f12 *, f9 f18 *, f9 f19 *, f9 f20 *, f9 f7 stand_scaler *, f9 f0 f16 + *, f9 f3 f16 + *, f9 f5 f16 + *, f9 f8 f16 + *, f9 f9 f16 + *, f9 f10 f16 + *, f9 f19 f16 + minmax_scaler, f9 f19 f16 + quan_trans, f4 log, f8 reciprocal, f7 f18 *]
```

### Explanation:
- **Transformation Additions**: Added `f4 log` and `f8 reciprocal` to explore logarithmic and reciprocal transformations, which can be useful when dealing with multiplicative relationships or diminishing returns.
- **Feature Combinations**: Retained key combinations and interactions, such as `f9 f19 f16 + quan_trans` and `f4 f16 + square`, suggesting non-linear effects.
- **Retained Components**: Kept most components that were present in both sets, assuming they were prioritized for their contribution towards prediction.
- **New Interaction**: Introduced `f7 f18 *` to evaluate potential interactions or joint effects between those features based on potential synergies.

By applying additional transformations like `log` and `reciprocal`, and evaluating combinations with `*`, the new feature set aims to capture potentially complex interactions and feature dynamics that could improve predictive performance.

The second example introduces non-linear transformations like tanh, sigmoid, quan_trans, and operations like addition and multiplication, which can enhance the feature set by considering interactions and non-linear scales. We can expand on this by:

1. Utilizing more combinations of basic transformations and operations such as addition, subtraction, and non-linear operations.
2. Including a broader range of non-linear transformations like log, reciprocal, and cube, which can capture different aspects of the data distribution.
3. Using scalers like stand_scaler along with the current transformations to enable features to reflect standardized variations.

Here is a proposed third feature set:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

Additions and improvements:
- Introduced interaction features like `f12 f7 f8 * - f6 f12 - -` to capture non-linear interactions between `f12`, `f7`, and `f8`.
- Added `f12 f7 f9 * - f6 f12 - -` to explore the impact of `f9` in the interaction context.
- Mixed non-linear transformations with feature differences and products, such as `f12 f7 f12 f11 + - f6 f19 - -`.
- Applied transformations like `sigmoid` and `tanh` on feature interactions to capture complex relationships.

This enhanced feature set brings together different aspects of linear scaling, interaction terms, and non-linear transformations, which could potentially improve the prediction model's ability to capture the underlying patterns associated with software defects.

2025-09-30 11:58:09,806 - INFO - llm output = To create a new and improved feature set inspired by the two provided examples, we can focus on leveraging transformations and combinations that capture non-linear relationships and interactions. We'll incorporate the richer operations from the second set while maintaining some of the simplicity from the first. Here's a more refined feature set:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Selection**: We selected a mixture of original features that are potentially informative (f0, f1, f4, f5, f8, etc.).

2. **Non-linear Transformations**: We applied some non-linear transformations like `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `log` to capture patterns in data that simple linear models might miss.

3. **Interaction Terms**: We included interactions (using operations such as `-`, `*`) to enhance the feature space by potentially capturing interactions between features.

4. **Standardization and Scaling**: We utilized `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `sigmoid` functions on features or interactions that are prone to variability, bringing them onto a common scale.

5. **Complex Combinations**: Some combinations involve subtractive interactions, wrapping primary interactions within function transformations, like using `tanh` and `cos`, which can capture complex relationships in the data. 

This enhanced feature set aims to provide a balance between interpretability and complexity to potentially yield better predictive performance for the downstream software defect prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this new set:
- The `f7 f8 * sqrt` transformation explores interaction effects between `f7` and `f8` and reduces the effect size using the square root.
- A logarithmic transformation `f10 log` captures exponential or multiplicative relationships.
- A new interaction and inverse via `f3 f11 / reciprocal` captures intricate dependency patterns that might not be detected through linear operations alone.

These new features aim at capturing potential non-linearities, interactions, and inverse behaviors, which might be crucial for improving the software defect prediction task.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here is an enhanced version of the feature set based on the given examples:

```plaintext
[f7, f8, f9, f10, f17, f7 square, f2 f9 -, f2 f11 -, f3 f9 -, f3 f11 -, f4 f1 -, f4 f5 -, f4 f12 -, f4 f17 -, f5 f4 -, f5 f18 -, f8 f1 -, f8 f15 -, f9 f1 -, f9 f2 -, f9 f3 -, f9 f13 -, f9 f19 -, f10 f9 -, f11 f2 -, f11 f4 -, f11 f20 -, f12 f4 -, f12 f10 -, f13 f9 -, f13 f11 -, f14 f12 -, f15 f5 -, f15 f11 -, f19 f5 -, f19 f9 -, f19 f12 -, f2 f9 - quan_trans, f2 f11 - minmax_scaler, f5 f18 - tanh, f5 f18 - sigmoid, f5 f18 - quan_trans, f8 f1 - f2 f9 - +, f8 f1 - f2 f9 - *, f4 f18 - sqrt, f2 f9 - f5 f18 - /, f1 f2 * f7 f9 * +, f3 f11 - cube, f8 f19 - / sqrt, f5 f9 - f3 * minmax_scaler]
```

**Explanation**: 
1. **Retained Transformations**: I've carried over existing transformations from the second feature set that seemed to have useful combined manipulations, such as `f5 f18 - sigmoid` and both arithmetic combinations of `f8 f1 -` and `f2 f9 -`.

2. **New Transformations**:
   - `f4 f18 - sqrt`: This transformation looks at the square root difference between features 4 and 18, potentially highlighting non-linear relationships.
   - `f2 f9 - f5 f18 - /`: The difference between features 2 and 9 divided by the difference between features 5 and 18, providing a normalized ratio capturing interactions.
   - `f1 f2 * f7 f9 * +`: A complex feature capturing interactions between 1, 2, 7, and 9 after multiplication, followed by addition.
   - `f3 f11 - cube`: Cubing the difference between features 3 and 11 to emphasize extreme differences.
   - `f8 f19 - / sqrt`: A normalized square root-driven transformation to potentially stabilize variance.
   - `f5 f9 - f3 * minmax_scaler`: This involves scaling after multiplying the difference between features 5 and 9 by feature 3, addressing potential skewness.

These steps aim to expand the representational power of the feature set, enabling better downstream predictions in software defect detection.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 11:58:36,471 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature sets provided, I'll generate a new feature set leveraging the operations defined to improve upon them. The goal is to explore combinations and transformations that could potentially enhance predictive power while maintaining the format and operation constraints given.

Here is a new, improved feature set:

```
[f5 ,f9 ,f11 ,f15 ,f16 ,f2 f9 - ,f3 f11 - ,f4 f10 - ,f8 f13 - ,f8 f15 - ,f9 f18 - ,f10 f3 - ,f12 f20 - ,f14 f5 - ,f19 f3 - ,f20 f11 - ,f5 reciprocal ,f13 reciprocal ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f11 stand_scaler ,f15 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f18 stand_scaler ,f5 sigmoid ,f9 sigmoid ,f13 sigmoid ,f11 cube ,f16 cube ,f12 f5 - cos ,f18 f5 - cos ,f9 f0 f15 - - cos ,f11 f0 f15 - - cos, f20 f15 sigmoid sqrt, f5 f15 -]]
```

### Key Points:
1. The selection of features `f5`, `f9`, `f11`, `f15`, `f16` reflects an emphasis on complexity, effort, and intelligence measures (Halstead metrics) that correlate with defectiveness.
2. Subtraction combinations focus on metrics that could potentially isolate significant contributors to defects by negating redundant or non-impactful interactions.
3. Transformation operations like `reciprocal`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `sigmoid`, `cos`, and `cube` explore nonlinear relationships, normalization, and scaling, which are often beneficial in enhancing model performance.
4. The advanced combination towards the end utilizes subtraction in conjunction with `cos` and `sigmoid sqrt` to capture nuanced behaviors, with the aim of improving defect prediction accuracy.

This feature set builds upon the blend of transformations offered, attempting to integrate multiple layers of preprocessing to increase variability and capture complexity effectively in the predictive model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Improvements include:
- Added additional mathematical transformations (`sinh`, `cos`, and `tanh`) to capture potential nonlinear relationships, specifically focusing on the important repeated features `f18`, `f9`, and `f11`.
- Introduced `log` and `reciprocal` transformations for `f6`, `f7`, and `f9` to enhance interpretability and model responsiveness to variations in underlying feature distributions.
