In this feature set:
- I used basic arithmetic combinations along with functions like `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and `cube` which are likely to provide non-linear transformations that aid many models.
- `quan_trans` is used to transform `f4` based on quantile normalization, which may help in tasks related to distributions.
- `stand_scaler` and `tanh` are also applied to scaled combinations of features, potentially improving their utility.
- I’ve included terms like `f3 f4 + f4 + cube` which explore more complex interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this new feature set:
- I've retained features like `f0`, `f1`, `f3`, and `f4` to ensure the base information is present.
- I've used `stand_scaler` and `sqrt` on `f4` to introduce different scaling and transformation perspectives.
- I added a new feature using `f4 log` to capture the logarithmic transformation.
- I've incorporated trigonometric transformations (`sin`, `cos`) for `f1` and `f2` and `tanh` for `f3` to capture potential periodic or non-linear relationships.
- Combined features through multiplication like `f2 f3 * stand_scaler` to capture interaction between features and standardize them.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's a suggestion for a better feature set, building on the examples given:

```
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 square f4 / quan_trans tanh cube, f4 stand_scaler quan_trans cube tanh, f1 tanh f3 sqrt *, f2 sqrt f3 tanh +, f1 sqrt f4 reciprocal tanh +, f3 stand_scaler, f4 log, f0 tanh]
```

Explanation:
- The transformation `f0 square f4 / quan_trans tanh cube` aims to capture non-linear interactions between father's occupation and son's occupation counts, normalized with quantile function and further processed with hyperbolic tangent and cubing.
- Using `f4 stand_scaler quan_trans cube tanh` leverages a standard scaling followed by quantile normalization, cubing, and hyperbolic tangent transformation, which can help normalize and highlight key distribution characteristics in the counts feature.
- Combining features `f1 tanh f3 sqrt *` could help capture interactions between son's occupation, family structure, and family structure variations.
- Using interactions like `f2 sqrt f3 tanh +` may highlight potential nonlinear relationships involving race and family structure.
- Including transformations like `f1 sqrt f4 reciprocal tanh +` accounts for nonlinear interplay among sonar occupation, counts, and additional subtle interactions.
- Addition of simpler transformations, such as `f3 stand_scaler`, `f4 log`, and `f0 tanh`, emphasizes normalization and nonlinear dimensional transformation for several features in isolation, potentially aiding general improvement in feature representation.

Explanation of selected transformations:
- The feature `f4 square sigmoid` involves squaring and then applying the sigmoid function to `f4`, which can help in normalizing and emphasizing certain pattern strengths.
- The feature `f1 f3 + tanh` uses a simple addition followed by a hyperbolic tangent, which could help in capturing non-linear relationships between `f1` and `f3`.
- The feature `f3 f4 tanh *` focuses on the interaction between features `f3` and `f4`, using a multiplicative interaction followed by hyperbolic tangent, which can capture multiplicative non-linear effects.
- The feature `f4 f3 cos / sqrt` uses division and cosine, which may highlight specific variance directions when juxtaposed with other features.
- The feature `f4 quan_trans sqrt tanh` uses quantile normalization, square root transformation, and tanh to manipulate `f4` for capturing variance in a non-linear scale.
- The feature `f2 f4 * cube` uses a cubic transformation of a multiplicative feature interaction to capture potential higher-order relationships.
- The feature `f3 f4 quan_trans cube + log` applies quantile transformation and cube before summation followed by log transformation to capture complex, possibly non-linear, relationships. 

These sets of transformations are meant to provide diverse perspectives on the data structure, which may help improve prediction accuracy.

The goal is to effectively transform and engineer the features to be more informative for the classification task.

Here is the proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f4 minmax_scaler cube tanh, f4 log sigmoid, f3 reciprocal sqrt, f1 stand_scaler tanh, f2 sqrt tanh, f4 sqrt cube tanh, f2 reciprocal tanh, f4 quan_trans tanh, f4 sqrt, f0 log f4 / tanh, f3 f2 cube * stand_scaler]
```

Key considerations in this feature transformation:

1. **Feature Scaling and Transformation:** Applying `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `log`, and `reciprocal` to some features can help with normalizing the data or handling skewed distributions. 

2. **Nonlinear Transformations:** Functions like `cube`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` introduced complex nonlinear patterns in the data, which might help capturing intricate relationships.

3. **Combining Transformations:** Combinations of operations, like applying `log` then `tanh` or `cube` before `stand_scaler`, can help making complex patterns more linearly separable. 

4. **Feature Interaction:** Interaction between features, such as `f3 f2 cube * stand_scaler`, allows for capturing dependencies between variables, providing potentially more informative features to the model.

These transformed features should aid machine learning models to better capture patterns relevant to the binary classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-22 10:39:38,917 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples you've provided, it seems like the goal is to generate new derived features that may help with classification. Each new feature transformation aims to capture additional characteristics or patterns in the data.

Here's a new feature set, inspired by the two examples but aiming for better feature transformations:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, 
 f4 minmax_scaler cube tanh, 
 f4 log sigmoid, 
 f3 reciprocal sqrt, 
 f1 quan_trans stand_scaler,

 f0 log, 
 f3 log, 
 f4 sqrt cube tanh, 
 f2 tanh reciprocal, 
 f4 square log sigmoide, 
 f3 cube reciprocal, 
 f0 stand_scaler tanh]
```

### Explanation of New Features:

1. **`f4 square log sigmoide`**: Applies a square, then the natural log, followed by the sigmoid function to the `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`. This transformation captures non-linear patterns while also ensuring the feature values are bounded.

2. **`f3 cube reciprocal`**: Raises the reciprocal of the `race` feature to the third power, possibly highlighting more subtle variations or interactions in this categorical feature when transformed.

3. **`f0 stand_scaler tanh`**: Applies a standard scaling followed by the hyperbolic tangent function to the `fathers_occupation`, which could standardize and non-linearly transform this categorical data for better modeling insights.

These transformations are designed to extract potentially useful, non-linear, and interaction-based features from the dataset.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor, Craftsmen-Other, Craftsman-Construction, Salesman-Retail, Manager, Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Farm_Laborer]

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f4 minmax_scaler cube tanh, f4 log sigmoid, f3 reciprocal sqrt, f1 quan_trans stand_scaler, f2 sqrt tanh, f1 tanh, f0 log, f3 log, f4 sqrt cube tanh, f2 tanh reciprocal] 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f4 minmax_scaler cube tanh, f4 log sigmoid, f3 reciprocal sqrt, f1 quan_trans stand_scaler, f2 sqrt tanh, f1 tanh, f0 log, f3 log]

This new feature set includes features from both examples and adds two additional transformations that could provide better insights: 

- `f0 minmax_scaler sqrt`: This transformation scales `f0` using a min-max scaler first and then applies the square root, which might help in normalizing `f0` and reducing skewness if any.
- `f3 reciprocal log`: This transformation takes the reciprocal of `f3` and then applies the logarithm function, which can help in emphasizing smaller variance within the `f3` feature and reducing impact of outliers if present.

Explanation:

1. Retain the features that demonstrate transformation into a standardized format or logarithmic scale, as these are often predictive and reduce skewness.
   
2. Use combinations of features with mathematical operations to capture interactions not evident in individual features.
   
3. Log transformation applied on the difference between `f3` and `f2` can reveal multiplicative relationships that might be subtle otherwise.

This feature set includes more complex transformations and aims for higher expressive power based on observed improvements in the given examples.
