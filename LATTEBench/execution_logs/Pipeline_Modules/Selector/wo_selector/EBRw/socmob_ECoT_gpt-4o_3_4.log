[f4 ,f4 cube ,f4 sin ,f4 f3 f2 - minmax_scaler / ,f4 quan_trans ,f4 square ,f4 cube square ,f4 sin minmax_scaler ,f4 f3 f2 - minmax_scaler / f4 + ,f4 f3 f2 - minmax_scaler / f4 cube + ,f3 cube f4 f3 f2 - minmax_scaler / f3 sin + ,f4 sin f3 f2 - minmax_scaler / f4 cos + ,f3 tanh f4 f3 f2 - minmax_scaler / f3 sqrt +]

Here are the principles followed to enhance the feature set:

1. We preserve the transformations that create non-linear relationships, such as cubing and taking sinusoidal forms.
2. We introduce `cos` and `tanh` functions to explore additional periodic and non-linear relationships in the data.
3. The interaction terms incorporate more transformations on `f3`, aiming to provide more representation complexity from father's occupation, considered critical in the social mobility context.

These transformations and interactions aim to capture complex patterns possibly inherent in social mobility effects, filtering predictive features through normalization and scaling as consistent with the previous examples.

2025-10-22 10:09:21,945 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided and the task requirements, we can aim to capture interactions or transformations that may better expose relationships between features. Particularly for prediction tasks, it's often useful to explore combinations or transformations of features that might highlight underlying patterns or differentiate between classes more effectively. Here's a new feature set proposal, incorporating ideas from the previous examples:

[f4 ,f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 square log ,f4 tanh ,f4 tanh f0 * ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f4 cube ,f3 log]

**Explanation:**

1. **Include Original Features**: We retain the original features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`) for their raw predictive power.

2. **Logarithm Transformation**: `f4 square log` aims to normalize skewness and potentially capture multiplicative interactions. This might be useful given `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` has a wide range and high standard deviation.

3. **Tanh Transformation**: `f4 tanh` aims to squash values to [-1, 1], potentially highlighting or limiting extreme values, useful for sigmoid-like transformations.

4. **Interaction Between Transformed Feature and Original**: `f4 tanh f0 *` attempts to capture any interaction effect between the transformed count feature and father's occupation, where `f0` is some feature representation of `fathers_occupation`.

5. **Square Root Transformation**: `f3 sqrt` applies a root transformation that can stabilize variance and is less aggressive than log, providing a different normalization flavor for features potentially related to categorical variables like race or family structure.

6. **Regular Square Root and Cube of Count**: `f4 sqrt` and `f4 cube` present an opportunity to capture non-linear effects or extreme values in count data, providing diverse modeling granularity.

7. **Log Transformation**: `f3 log` adds to the mix by handling skewed distributions potentially present in categorical feature encodings or other abstract transformations for discrete data.

By combining transformations and interactions, this feature set aims to leverage the range of different operations to better capture the complex relationships inherent in social data regarding mobility prediction.

2025-10-22 10:09:26,003 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the given feature set examples, it's important to focus on transformations that might capture underlying patterns or relationships more effectively, especially for the target prediction task. Utilizing combinations of transformations can often uncover latent features that provide better separation between classes. Here's a proposed enhanced feature set:

```
[f2 minmax_scaler f3 sqrt + tanh cube sqrt minmax_scaler , f4 sqrt sigmoid , f4 minmax_scaler f4 sqrt + , f4 f4 f4 * + minmax_scaler , f2 minmax_scaler f3 sqrt + tanh cube sqrt f4 sqrt + , f2 minmax_scaler f3 sqrt + tanh cube sqrt f4 sin + , f4 sqrt f4 sqrt * , f4 minmax_scaler f4 f4 * + minmax_scaler , f2 minmax_scaler f3 sqrt + tanh cube sqrt reciprocal , f2 minmax_scaler f3 sqrt + tanh cube sqrt cos , f4 minmax_scaler f4 f4 * + sigmoid ]
```

Key changes and reasoning:
1. Introduce additional scaling (e.g., `minmax_scaler`, `sigmoid`) to normalize and transform features post-combination, ensuring they fit within a consistent range and nonlinear transformation.
2. Combine feature operations where appropriate (e.g., `f2 minmax_scaler f3 sqrt + tanh cube sqrt` with various other transformations) to create nuanced representations.
3. Experiment with reciprocal and trigonometric transformations (such as `cos`) applied post-combination to prevent the dominance of overly large feature values. This could help differentiate class categories when creating decision boundaries.

These transformations aim to leverage both normalization/scaling effects and nonlinear relationships the original features might reveal when interacting with each other, potentially leading to better predictive performance in the social mobility task.

```

Explanation:
1. Maintain `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` as they are the original features.
2. Add a new combined feature using addition: `f3 f4 +`.
3. Use min-max scaling on `f2` after subtracting `f3` to capture relative difference, normalized: `f2 f3 - minmax_scaler`.
4. Retain cubic transformation on both `f3` and `f4`, capturing non-linear relationships: `f3 cube`, `f4 cube`.
5. Use the sinusoidal transformation on `f2` for capturing cyclic dependencies.
6. Apply min-max scaling followed by a sinusoidal transformation to `f3` for normalized cyclic variation: `f3 minmax_scaler sin`.
7. Use a cosine transformation on `f4` to complement the sinusoidal view: `f4 cos`.
8. Divide transformed features to give a combined normalized perspective: `f4 f3 f2 - minmax_scaler /`.
9. A second transformation with more non-linearity applied on the above division: `f4 f3 f2 - minmax_scaler / cube`.

- Leverage logarithmic and reciprocal transformations that can manage skewness and highlight multiplicative relationships.
- Introduce interaction terms between transformed features for capturing complex dependencies.

### Explanation:
- `f0, f1, f2, f3, f4`: Retaining these original features ensures that the fundamental input data is still part of the feature set.
- `f2 minmax_scaler`: Normalize `f2` between 0 and 1 to potentially reduce feature scaling issues.
- `f4 sqrt`: Using square root transformation on `f4`, assuming it has positive values, to reduce skewness.
- `f3 f0 / sqrt`: Taking the ratio of `f3` and `f0` and applying square root to capture interaction effects while reducing scale differences.
- `f4 log`: Log transformation of `f4` can help in normalizing positively skewed distributions.
- `f1 f3 * minmax_scaler`: Interaction term between `f1` and `f3` followed by minmax scaling. This captures interactions while normalizing their scales.
- `f4 minmax_scaler f3 + tanh`: Combines a normalized version of `f4` with `f3` and then applies the hyperbolic tangent, which can help in handling outliers and achieving smooth transitions.

These transformations aim to bring out underlying patterns and interactions, potentially improving prediction capabilities by normalizing data, reducing skewness, and capturing meaningful feature interactions.

Explanation:
1. `f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler`: These scaled versions help in normalizing the data to a uniform scale which can be beneficial for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.
2. `f2 f3 * reciprocal square`: This feature captures an interaction between `f2` and `f3` by multiplying them and further applying reciprocal and square transformations which might reveal nonlinear relationships.
3. `f0 f1 + stand_scaler`: Standard scaling any combined feature could help in dealing with features that stem from different distributions.
4. `f3 cube`: Cubing might emphasize the magnitude differences in `f3`.
5. `f4 log`: Applying a logarithmic transformation on `f4` aids in handling skewed distributions which could have significant predictive power.
6. `f3 tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent could provide benefits in damping extreme feature values and bring them within a certain numerical range.
7. `f4 sqrt`: Square root transformation can provide a nuanced view of the feature's scale, particularly beneficial if the data features variance-related characteristics. 

These transformed features aim at yielding improved representations that could enhance model performance in predicting the two-class nominal target feature.

This set includes:

- Applying a logarithmic transformation to `f4` before scaling, which can help manage skewness and improve model performance.
- Using standard scaling on `f1 - f4`, which could handle different scales of the subtraction result more effectively compared to min-max scaling.
- Adding a `tanh` transformation for `f2` which can capture non-linear patterns in the data.
- Keeping the `sigmoid` transformation for `f3` to handle any potential outliers.
- Appending a `reciprocal` transformation followed by min-max scaling on `f1`, which could help in dealing with inverse relationships and normalizing the scale.

Explanation of the chosen transformations:
1. Retained base features `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4` to keep the original data context.
2. Extracted the improved non-linear interaction feature `f2 minmax_scaler f3 sqrt + tanh` which combines `f2` and `f3`.
3. Used a combination of `sin` with `minmax_scaler` and `sqrt` on `f4` to capture periodic transformations and adjustments to a scale between 0 and 1 with further non-linear scaling.
4. Retained `f0 minmax_scaler` as scaling is typically beneficial for machine learning algorithms.
5. Added squared transformations of `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` to capture potential quadratic effects after scaling.
6. Included logarithmic transformation of `f4` to handle non-linear growth and variance reduction.

This feature set aims to combine various polynomial, trigonometric, and scaling transformations to potentially enhance feature interactions and capture complex relationships in the data, aiding in accurate predictions of the target variable.

**Explanation:**
- **Min-Max Scaling** on `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` ensures that these features are normalized to a specific range, which can help with certain models like logistic regression or neural networks.
- **Sin Transformation** on `f4` can help capture periodic or cyclic patterns if they exist in the data.
- Transformations like **Sqrt** on `f2` and `f4` can linearize relationships, making them more interpretable for linear models.
- **Square Transformation** on `f3` can capture quadratic relationships, which might be useful if there's evidence of such a relationship in the data.
- **Min-Max Scaling** on `f1` maintains consistency in feature scaling, ensuring that this feature also lies within a normalized range.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-10-22 10:10:25,812 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given examples, the goal is to construct a new and improved feature set using feature transformations. Both examples use various transformations such as `minmax_scaler`, `square`, and combinations thereof. The second example seems slightly more refined compared to the first, featuring a reduced emphasis on repeated transformations on the same feature.

A better version would streamline redundant transformations and potentially explore additional transformations for diversity. Here is a refined feature set considering the examples:

```
[f2, f3, f4, f4 f4 + minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, f4 square, f4 sqrt minmax_scaler]
```

Changes and considerations:

1. Simplified and reduced redundancy in transformation, particularly the double minmax_scaler on `f4` in the second example.
2. Introduced a `sqrt` transformation combined with `minmax_scaler` on `f4` to add feature variety.
3. Preserved key transformations like `square` and single `minmax_scaler` across the features`f1`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` as in previous examples, ensuring continuity in the development of meaningful features.

Changes and reasoning:
1. Maintain features from both examples, as they have been consistent.
2. Improve upon the previous set by ensuring transformations are applied in a manner that captures non-linear patterns effectively, such as using combinations of square and cube transformations.
3. Substitute the repetitive minmax scaling with sigmoid on `f4` for potential better feature distribution.
4. The addition of the `f0 square` transformation might help capture variability in the dataset further based on the occupation mapping impacts.
5. Ensure stability in the transformations with the use of controlled scaling while balancing complexity and interpretability.

**Explanation of Choices:**

1. **`f1 minmax_scaler f2 minmax_scaler *`**: Multi-feature scaling can sometimes reveal interactions across different features that might relate more closely to the target variable. Multiplying scaled versions of `f1` and `f2` might capture interactions between these features effectively.

2. **`f3 f4 + minmax_scaler cube`**: New transformation by combining and scaling `f3` and `f4` and then applying the cube operation. This can capture non-linear relationships, especially if the sum has significant relevance in transforming the target variable into meaningful insights.

By constructing these transformations, the new feature set aims to not only include key representations from the original feature sets but also add a layer of complexity that could potentially improve predictive capability for the two-class nominal target feature.

Explanation of transformations:

- **Min-Max Scaling:** Used frequently to ensure that features are on a similar scale and are not biased towards larger values, such as `f2 minmax_scaler`, `f3 minmax_scaler`, and `f4 minmax_scaler`.

- **Square and Logarithmic Transformations:** Applying square and log functions can help capture non-linear relationships and condensation of range, like `f4 square` and `f4 log`.

- **Product Feature:** Creating interaction terms such as `f1 f2 * minmax_scaler` and `f2 f3 * minmax_scaler` to capture dependency between features.

- **Combination with Subtraction:** To get difference perspective as `f1 f4 - minmax_scaler`.

- **Division and Square Root Transformations:** As additional non-linear combinations, such as `f0 f3 / minmax_scaler` and `f4 sqrt`.

These transformations aim at enriching the feature space by capturing potential non-linear relationships and interactions between features, which might improve the model's predictive performance on the binary classification task.

The second feature set applies multiple transformations to each feature, such as min-max scaling, squaring, and applying the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) while incorporating redundancy removal and interactions. 

Here is a proposed feature set that builds on the examples provided, incorporating more complex interactions and transformations:

```plaintext
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f4 sin minmax_scaler f4 - tanh minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, (f1 f2 +) sqrt, (f3 f4 *) log, (f2 f4 /) cube, (f1 f3 +) sigmoid, f4 stand_scaler, (f1 f2 f3 + +) reciprocal]
```

This new feature set maintains the transformations from the previous example but adds the following:

- Combined interactions using addition and multiplication for cross-features.
- Use of square root, logarithm, and cube for complex transformations.
- Sigmoid and standard scaling for normalization and non-linearity management.
- Reciprocal to handle inverse relationships, potentially capturing growth decay patterns. 

This proposed feature set targets capturing more complex interactions and non-linear patterns that may help the model make better predictions.

Explanation:

1. Including original features (f0 to f4) ensures that the raw data is available for analysis.
2. Transformations such as sqrt, sigmoid, and tanh can be particularly useful for normalizing data and extracting non-linear relationships.
3. Using the min-max scaler after subtracting f4 from f1 can help in capturing differences between these features in a scaled manner.
4. Adding extra tanh transformations for f1 and f3 provides additional non-linear transformations, which can sometimes improve predictive performance in models focused on complex relationships.

```

In this feature set:

1. The first four elements `[f1, f2, f3, f4]` represent retaining the original features which may contain valuable information.
2. The next feature `f4 minmax_scaler f3 minmax_scaler *` multiplies the scaled versions of `f3` and `f4`, potentially capturing interaction effects between these features.
3. The feature `f2 minmax_scaler f1 minmax_scaler +` adds the scaled versions of `f1` and `f2`, which might help in understanding combined effects.
4. The feature `f3 sqrt f4 sqrt + reciprocal stand_scaler` starts by applying square root to both `f3` and `f4`, adds them, then takes the reciprocal, and finally standardizes the result. This could help in normalizing the growth rate of features.
5. The feature `f1 f4 * minmax_scaler` multiplies `f1` and `f4`, then scales it to potentially highlight combined significance.
6. The feature `f2 cube minmax_scaler` cubes `f2` and then scales it in order to increase the weight of larger values of `f2`, making potential influential patterns more evident.

This transformation should provide a richer set of features for model training and could potentially improve predictive performance.

1. `f1 f4 * minmax_scaler`: Introduces a new interaction term between `f1` and `f4`, scaled using min-max scaling to capture potential non-linear relationships between these features.

2. `f3 f4 / sqrt`: Combines `f3` and `f4` and applies a square root transformation, which can help manage skewness and improve predictive performance by reducing the influence of extreme values.

These additions aim to enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data, potentially improving its predictive accuracy.

2025-10-22 10:11:46,661 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the two examples you've provided, I'll create a new set of features that could enhance the prediction performance while building on the transformations applied in the examples. The goal here is to use transformations that further explore the non-linear relationships and interactions in the data.

Here's a suggested feature set:

[f2, f3, f4, f4 f4 + minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, f4 square, f4 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler square, f1 minmax_scaler f1 minmax_scaler *, f1 f3 + tanh, f2 f3 * sqrt, f4 f3 / cube, f2 f4 * sigmoid, f1 f2 * log]

This new feature set introduces several new transformations:
- **tanh**: Applied to the sum of `f1` and `f3`, capturing potential non-linear interactions between these features.
- **sqrt**: Applied after multiplication of `f2` and `f3`, which could emphasize specific interactions.
- **cube**: Used to explore variability when dividing `f4` by `f3`, adding complexity.
- **sigmoid**: Applied to the product of `f2` and `f4`, which may help capture bounded interactions.
- **log**: Enhances feature interactions by taking logarithm of the product between `f1` and `f2`.

These additions could offer a richer feature space for predictive modeling by exploring more complex relationships and interactions in the data.
