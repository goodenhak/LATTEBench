2025-10-01 20:33:39,966 - INFO - llm output = To create a new and improved feature set based on the two given examples, I'll combine elements from both while also prioritizing transformations that can enhance the predictive power of the dataset:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f7 sig  cos, f10 square square, f8 sin square, f14 square cos, f7 sigmoid cos, f5 minmax_scaler stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f10 square cos, f11 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f10 f10 * cos]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection**: 
   - Retained the original numerical and essential categorical features from both examples.
   
2. **Feature Transformation**:
   - Selected impactful transformations like square, sigmoid, cosine, and combinations thereof to maintain non-linearity and capture complex relationships.
   - Added a cosine transformation of the square to exploit periodicity and non-linear interactions.

3. **Scaling**:
   - Diverse scaling strategies are applied widely across features to normalize and standardize the data, ensuring better model convergence and performance.
   
4. **Combinations**:
   - Included meaningful combinations of transformations to introduce new dynamics and interactions, like `f10 square cos` and `f10 f10 * cos`, to capture interaction effects. 

By mindfully integrating transformations, scaling, and feature interactions, this new set is designed to maximize the predictive accuracy of credit card application success.

### Explanation:
- **Core features (f5, f8, f9, f10, f14)**: Retain core features that are likely informative.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Applied to normalize features between 0 and 1.
- **Cubing and Tanh**: Cubing generates non-linear transformations, and Tanh is applied for differentiation and handling skewness.
- **Sin and Tanh**: Trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations may capture periodic relationships or smooth nonlinearities.
- **Feature Interactions (Additions and Multiplications)**: These capture potential interactions between features (e.g., debt with years employed).
- **Subtractions (f5 f9 -, f5 f10 -)**: Captures the difference which might highlight contrasting characteristics.
- **Square Roots**: Offers transformation for features believed to be skewed, especially alongside cubing.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:33:49,106 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, let's construct a new and improved feature set by selecting elements from both feature sets and potentially adding one or two more transformations that could improve feature representation for the prediction task. 

Here is the new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f7 f14 + f7 f10 + * stand_scaler ,f7 f14 + f7 f8 sin f8 f10 f8 / - * + * stand_scaler ,f3 f3 - ,f3 f4 - ,f4 f3 - ,f4 f4 - ,f0 sigmoid ,f0 quan_trans f3 f7 + sqrt]
```

In this updated feature set, I added the `f3 f7 + sqrt` transformation at the end to incorporate a feature representing an aggregate measure of years employed (`f7`) and age (`f3`), which is then scaled using the square root. This aims to capture interaction effects between these features that may prove useful in predicting credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:34:01,692 - INFO - llm output = To create a new and improved feature set based on the two given examples, we can focus on exploring meaningful transformations and combinations of features that might capture interactions or non-linear relationships beneficial for predicting the outcome.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```

### Explanation:
- We retained the transformations that made use of the `stand_scaler` followed by a `cube` of `f10` and `f14`, which might capture extreme values in drivers' licenses and incomes.
- We included a `tanh` transformation for `f8`, which can help spread out bounded values and could potentially separate distinct patterns in the PriorDefault feature.
- We added a `sqrt` transformation on `f9` and a `log` transformation on `f2`, which can help normalize distributions with positive skews for Employed and Debt features, respectively.
- We included a multiplication of `f0 * f1` to explore interaction effects between Gender and Age, which might affect credit card approval likelihoods.

- Square root and quantile transformation are used for stabilization and normalization of feature distributions.
- Complex combinations such as `f8 f14 + f10 sin f9 / *` aim to capture non-linear relationships effectively.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:34:33,317 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set inspired by the two provided examples, we'll aim to combine elements from both while introducing meaningful transformations. Here's a suggestion for an improved feature set:

```
[f5 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f13 ,f14 ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 f2 * ,f4 f2 * ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f5 cube ,f7 cube ,f8 cube ,f10 cube ,f14 cube ,f2 f5 minmax_scaler + ,f3 f6 * ,f4 f10 * ,f5 quan_trans ,f9 sin ,f10 stand_scaler ,f5 reciprocal ,f5 cos ,f5 tanh ,f5 sigmoid]
```

**Justification for the improved feature set:**

1. **Retained Core Features (f5 to f14):** Keeping features f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, and f14 as they are means retaining the primary features found in both examples.

2. **Mixed Interactions:** Included interactions such as `f3 f2 *` and `f4 f2 *` which were part of the second example and highlight relationships between features such as employment status or prior default with other features like age or income.

3. **Scaled and Transformed Variants:** Utilized scaling transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` for selected features (e.g., f2, f10) to help with algorithm convergence and highlight feature variability.

4. **Advanced Function Transforms:** Added mathematical transformations such as `cube`, `reciprocal`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` on f5 and others to potentially capture nonlinear relationships in the data.

5. **Combined Interactions and Transforms:** The feature set includes interactions (`f2 f5 minmax_scaler +`, `f4 f10 *`) and transformations of combinations to ensure intricate patterns are captured.

This feature set strikes a balance between leveraging meaningful interactions and standard data transformations drawn from the original examples provided.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The new feature set should leverage transformations that could highlight patterns not explicitly visible in the original feature set, utilize combinations of features, and apply scaling or transformations that stabilize variance or bring non-linearity effectively.

Here's the new feature set, using components and approaches seen in both examples while attempting to introduce novel combinations:

```

```

In this new feature set:
- I've retained components that cover the breadth of impactful features from both original examples, emphasizing those that had transformations proven to be useful, such as stand_scaler and quan_trans.
- Introduced novel combinations like `f1 f2 * sqrt` to explore interactions between gender and age, potentially spotlighting demographic shifts.
- Used operations like `/ log` to explore stability in ratios where applicable.
- Applied `tanh` on a combination `f6 f7 *` to potentially smooth employment types and years employed interactions over nonlinear boundaries.

This new set aims to maintain robust feature transformations while exploring deeper feature interactions empirically.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-10-01 20:34:56,508 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set for predicting successful credit card applications, I'll combine insights from both examples to create an enhanced feature set. I'll retain relevant features, introduce transformations that could capture non-linear relationships, and enhance feature interactions.

Here is the improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f3 f2 *, f3 f5 *, f3 f6 *, f3 f7 *, f3 f8 *, f3 f10 *, f3 f14 *, f4 f2 *, f4 f7 *, f4 f8 *, f4 f10 *, f4 f14 *, f3 square, f4 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f14 cube, f3 f2 * cube, f3 f5 * cube, f5 reciprocal, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f5 sin, f7 sigmoid, f9 log, f3 f8 * reciprocal, f8 sqrt, f6 f14 * cube]
```

Improvements/Changes made:
- Retained most features from both sets as they capture important interactions.
- Added `f7 sigmoid` and `f9 log` to potentially reveal sigmoid and logarithmic relationships in the data.
- Introduced `f3 f8 * reciprocal` to explore interaction between these features in the inverse relation.
- Included `f8 sqrt` as a transformation for potential non-linear smoothing of this feature.
- Added interaction `f6 f14 * cube` to explore a deep polynomial interaction previously unexplored.

These changes aim to improve model performance by capturing complex relationships within the data, thereby making predictions more accurate.

### Improved Feature Set:

1. **[f2, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14]**: Start with the baseline of key features.
2. **[f10 f10 * cos]**: Keep this interaction term from the second set for potential non-linear relationships.
3. **[f2 tanh]**: Use the tanh transformation for balancing f2's distribution.
4. **[f5 stand_scaler]**: Standardize f5, as differing scales might affect model performance.
5. **[f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh]**: Apply tanh to these to manage outlier values and improve distribution.
6. **[f14 tanh]**: Similar application to maintain consistency across features.
7. **[f7 cos, f14 sigmoid cos]**: Retain these cosine transformations from both sets for complex pattern capture.
8. **[f8 quan_trans]**: Quantile transform f8 for a normal-like distribution.
9. **[f9 stand_scaler]**: Standardize f9 to help with potential model convergence issues.
10. **[f2 cube]**: Keep the cubed transformation for f2 for detecting interactions established by both linear and cubic forms.
11. **[f14 sigmoid cos stand_scaler]**: An advanced combination to potentially capture intricate relationships.
12. **[f7 sigmoid cos stand_scaler]**: Also combine operations for f7 to introduce feature complexity.

This improved feature set builds upon the transformations that best modify each original feature's scale and distribution, while also incorporating advanced transformations to possibly capture more complex relationships between features that could aid in enhancing the predictive power of your model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-01 20:35:09,493 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, I'll generate a new and improved feature set by combining elements from both. The new feature set should encompass a wider range of transformations and interactions, while maintaining diversity and avoiding redundancy.

Here's the new feature set:

```plaintext
[f8, f9, f10, f14,

```

In this new feature set, I maintained the diverse transformations from both sets, ensuring representation of statistical transformations like square, cube, sin, and tanh, while introducing a new transformation—logarithm (f9 log)—to potentially capture non-linear relationships. I added transformations that efficiently capture feature interactions and new representations that could be instrumental for downstream tasks.

This feature set incorporates a range of transformations such as `sigmoid`, `cube`, and arithmetic operations, along with effective combinations from both previous feature sets. The aim is to construct a rich feature space that captures important interactions and transformations for better predictive performance. The use of operations like `tanh` and `cos`, along with multiplicative and additive combinations, ensures coverage of non-linear relationships and interactions that are useful for the prediction task.

   - **Cubic and Reciprocal Transformations**: Useful for adjusting skewed distributions and capturing diminishing returns.
   - **Quadratic Transformations and Sums**: Useful for capturing interactions between features, which can reveal more complex insights.
   - **Scaled and Transformed Features (quantile, minmax, standard)**: Improves linear model performance and robustness by standardizing feature scale and distributions.
   - **Trigonometric Transformations (e.g., sine, square)**: Useful for periodic data or encoding circular relationships, though less interpretable directly here, could capture non-linear patterns.

3. **Feature Specific Transformations**:
   - **Quantile Transformation**: Helps in transforming non-normal distributions into a normal distribution, improving model performance.
   - **Reciprocal and Sqrt**: May help in managing features like debt or income that might have a large range and skewed distributions.

By combining meaningful transformations, interactions, and standard features, we can potentially capture complex relationships that can improve model prediction accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-10-01 20:35:49,066 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the given examples, I will consider the transformations used and try to propose a set that includes useful operations and covers a wide variety of feature interactions and transformations. We aim to improve upon the previous sets by maintaining important transformations and not discarding potentially useful interactions.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f3 f2 *, f3 f5 *, f3 f7 *, f3 f8 *, f3 f10 *, f3 f14 *, f4 f2 *, f4 f7 *, f4 f8 *, f4 f10 *, f4 f14 *, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f14 cube, f3 f2 * cube, f3 f5 * cube, f5 reciprocal, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f5 cube, f5 sin, f5 minmax_scaler, f5 cos, f5 sigmoid]
```

Explanation:

1. **Interaction Terms**: I've maintained the product interactions between various combinations of features (e.g., `f3 f2 *`, `f3 f5 *`, `f4 f2 *`). Such interactions can capture non-linear relationships between features that may be indicative of the outcome.

2. **Higher-Order Terms**: Cubic transformations for selected features (e.g., `f7 cube`, `f8 cube`) and their products provide a way to capture more complex relationships.

3. **Standard Scaling & Min-Max Scaling**: Standard scaling (`f9 stand_scaler`, `f10 stand_scaler`) and min-max scaling (`f5 minmax_scaler`) ensure features are appropriately normalized, which is beneficial for many machine learning algorithms.

4. **Non-linear Transformations**: Use of reciprocal (`f5 reciprocal`), trigonometric functions (`f5 sin`, `f5 cos`), and sigmoid (`f5 sigmoid`) provide a rich set of non-linear transformations to capture any inherent non-linearity in the data relating to credit card application success.

These transformations and interactions provide a comprehensive feature space that should improve the model's predictive performance while not overcomplicating or excessively expanding the feature set.

```

Changes and rationale:

1. Combined the transformations `f8 quan_trans sigmoid` from the first set with `f8 tanh` from the second set to create `f8 quan_trans sigmoid`, recognizing the potential interactions between non-linear transformations and quantile transformations.
   
2. Introduced `f9 f4 + f3 /` from the first set to consider the interaction between `f4` and `f3` in relation to `f9`.

3. Kept `f10 f10 * cos` from the second set which could capture complex variations of `f10`.

4. Added `f9 sigmoids` to introduce non-linearity and cap the values between 0 and 1.
   
5. Retained multiple scaling and non-linear transformations across features as strong regularizers which aid in normalization and variance control.

This feature set preserves useful transformations and interactions and seeks a blend of non-linear transformations, scaling, and interaction terms as per both provided examples.

We'll focus on a combination of arithmetic operations, non-linear transformations, and scaling. Here's a new feature set proposal:

**Explanation:**
- **Transformed Interactions:** I've included interactions between features based on division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction to capture potential relationships.
- **Non-linear Transformations:** Applied transformations like cube, square, tanh, reciprocal, cos, sin, and log to introduce non-linearities.
- **Scaling:** Used min-max scaling to help standardize feature ranges.
- **Focus on Informative Features:** Selected features (e.g., f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14) that frequently appeared in both example feature sets, assuming they are particularly informative.

My approach here will be to retain features that seem to be beneficial from both sets and possibly introduce a few new transformations to enhance the model's understanding.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f2, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f10 quan_trans cos, f7 sigmoid cos, f14 sigmoid cos, f10 f10 * cos, f2 tanh, f5 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f14 tanh, f7 cos, f7 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f5 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f7 sigmoid cos stand_scaler, f14 sigmoid cos stand_scaler, f2 cube, f8 stand_scaler, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f8 minmax_scaler, f5 reciprocal]
```

**Explanation:**
1. Retained basic transformed features such as `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `stand_scaler` as present in both examples.
2. Kept features already subjected to cosine and other transformations, as these might help in capturing non-linear relationships.
3. Added `f8 minmax_scaler` for scaling based on range normalization, which could allow certain ML models to perform better.
4. Introduced `f5 reciprocal` to possibly highlight the inverse relationships, which might be significant in some cases.
5. Kept the cube transformation (`f2 cube`) to capture larger variance relationships.
   
This improved feature set incorporates a variety of transformations that are likely to capture different aspects of the underlying dataset, making it potentially more powerful for prediction tasks.

### Explanation
1. **Retaining Key Features**: Kept the direct features \(f5\) (Industry), \(f7\) (YearsEmployed), \(f8\) (PriorDefault), \(f9\) (Employed), \(f10\) (CreditScore), \(f13\) (ZipCode), and \(f14\) (Income) as these features could significantly impact the prediction.

2. **Interaction Terms**: Included interaction terms like \(f3 \times f2\), \(f4 \times f2\), \(f3 \times f7\), to capture interactions between Debt and other features (e.g. YearsEmployed, Ethnicity).

3. **Nonlinear Transformations**: Applied nonlinear transformations such as squaring \(f3\), cubing \(f4\), \(f7\), \(f8\), \(f9\), \(f10\), \(f13\), and \(f14\) to capture non-linear relationships.

4. **Composite Features**: Added interaction features such as \(f7 \times f8\) and \(f7 \times f3\) to account for potential synergies between YearsEmployed and Employment status or Debt.

5. **Complex Interactions**: Introduced more complex nonlinear interactions like \((f9 + f10) \times f5\) and \((f13 + f14) / f6\) to capture combined effects of employment metrics with Industry, and location combined with BankCustomer status.

By creating these new features, I aim to encapsulate additional predictive power by accounting for potential interactions and non-linear effects that might not be apparent with the original features alone.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-10-01 20:36:30,829 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and transformation operations, I will create a new feature set that leverages transformations useful for predicting credit card application success, while combining principles from the given examples.

Here is the improved feature set:

```  
[f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f2 f7 * f9 /, f10 sqrt, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f13 tanh, f14 tanh, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f13 cube, f14 cube, f8 f7 / cube, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f2 f8 - tanh, f2 f9 - tanh, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f8 log, f9 log, f10 sin]

```

Explanation:

1. Retained some core features from both examples like `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, and `f14` which seem significant.
2. Used tanh transformation on features `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f13`, and `f14` for non-linear scaling.
3. Applied cube transformation to `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, `f13`, `f14` for feature magnitude adjustments and capturing non-linear dependencies.
4. Applied min-max scaling and logarithmic transformation on `f8`, `f9`, and `f10` to normalize and stabilize variance.
5. Combined `f2` with `f8` and `f9` using subtraction and tanh for creating interdependent scaled features.
6. Used a new feature `f10 sqrt` for representing potential significance of square root transformation on this feature.
7. Included a division and multiplication operation `f2 f7 * f9 /` to capture relative relationships between features.
8. Applied sine transformation on `f10` to exploit periodicity if relevant.

These transformations are aimed at creating more complex, informative features that can help improve prediction performance in the downstream task of predicting credit card application success.

- Retained key transformations such as tanh and sigmoid that are often beneficial for managing scale and non-linearity in features.
- Combined and reduced overlapping transformations while preserving potentially informative ones by considering both feature sets. 
- Prioritized complex transformations like stand_scaler and quantile transformations which help normalize and scale data effectively, reducing the influence of variance. 
- Included arithmetic combinations to enhance interaction terms among features, as seen in the expressions "f8 cos f2 tanh +" and "f9 f4 + f3 /".

```

In this feature set:
- Basic interactions (`f2 f5 *`, `f3 f5 *`, etc.) are used to explore multiplication effects of features.
- `minmax_scaler` and `tanh` are employed for potential stabilization and to transform skewed data.
- The `cube` transformation is used on several features, hypothesizing non-linear relationships.
- We've included a few strategic sine transformations (`f9 sin`, `f10 sin`, `f14 sin`) for periodicity capturing.
- Some interaction terms are augmented with `tanh` to explore non-linear interaction effects.

This set should help capture complex interactions and non-linearities that might be beneficial for improving model predictions.

2025-10-01 20:36:59,804 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set that combines insights from both provided examples, we need to incorporate transformations that capture the relationships among features effectively while potentially introducing new non-linear aspects. Here's a feature set that combines aspects of the two examples:

```
[f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f5 f6 *, f8 f7 /, f9 f6 *, f10 f5 *, f14 f3 *, f2 f8 - tanh, f9 f3 * sigmoid, f10 f4 * tanh, f13 cube sigmoid, f14 quan_trans, f8 cube, f9 reciprocal, f10 tanh, f7 + f8, f9 f10 * sin, f13 tanh, f14 tanh f10 /, f2 f9 - cosine]
```

In this feature set, I've:

1. Combined foundational features (`f2`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, `f14`) as seen in both examples.
2. Included transformations capturing interactions such as multiplies and divisions `(f5 f6 *, f8 f7 /, f9 f6 *, f10 f5 *, f14 f3 *)`.
3. Introduced non-linear transformations with functions like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cosine` to explore their effects on transformed or combined features.
4. Utilized statistical transformations such as `quan_trans` to normalize or non-linearly transform features, specifically `f14` that can exhibit a complex distribution.
5. Added a few non-linear interactions like `cube`, `reciprocal`, `sin`, `cosine`, and combinations involving them for feature richness.

This feature set aims to balance linear interactions captured in the original examples and the added non-linear transformations to explore potential complex relationships.

We'll integrate some of the transformations used in both examples, prioritizing those that involve non-linear transformations and combinations that could potentially capture interactions between features. Here's a suggested improved feature set:

```
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f5 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f2 cube, f9 tanh, f14 tanh, f8 quan_trans, f9 cos stand_scaler, f8 cos f2 tanh +, f7 cos, f8 quan_trans sigmoid, f10 quan_trans sigmoid, f14 sigmoid, f9 f4 + f3 /, f0 reciprocal, f10 f4 +, f8 f4 +, f10 f3 +, f2 f3 +]
```

This feature set includes a combination of standardized features, non-linear transformations (e.g., tanh, cos, sigmoid), and interactions between features through addition and division operations. This approach can help capture different scales and complexities in the data that might correlate with the prediction outcome.

Key changes and additions:
- Combined features from both examples to maximize information. 
- Kept the unique transformation `f6 tanh` from the second set as it was not present in the first.
- Added an interaction feature `f2 f10 * sqrt` (representing the square root of the product of these features), introducing complexity and potential non-linear relationships.

In order to make it more effective, I've included some operations that can help capture non-linear relationships, improved normalization, and interactions between important features. Here's an improved feature set:

```
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f3 f2 * , f3 f5 * , f3 f6 * , f3 f7 * , f3 f8 * , f3 f10 * , f3 f14 * , f4 f2 * , f4 f7 * , f4 f8 * , f4 f10 * , f4 f14 * , f3 square, f4 cube, f5 square, f6 square, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f14 cube, f3 f2 * cube, f3 f5 * cube, f5 reciprocal, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f5 sin, f3 f14 * reciprocal]
```

### Explanation:
- **Base Features**: Retain base useful features (`f5`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, `f13`, `f14`) as they are important for model training.
- **Interaction Terms**: Use interactions involving `f3`, `f5`, `f6`, and the like to capture combinations that may have predictive power.
- **Polynomial Terms**: Include squares and cubes to model non-linear relationships inherent in financial datasets (`f3 square`, `f4 cube`, etc.).
- **Normalization Techniques**: Use `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for standardization and normalization of certain features (`f9 stand_scaler`, `f10 stand_scaler`), and also add minmax scaling for `f9` and `f14` ensuring improved feature scaling.
- **Non-linear Transformations**: Incorporate non-linear transformations like `reciprocal` and `sin` on select features.
- **Cross-term Reciprocal**: `f3 f14 * reciprocal` to capture inverse interactions, potentially capturing unique patterns.

This representation should enhance the quality of features being fed into any downstream model and improve its ability to make accurate predictions regarding credit card application success.

```

In this feature set:
- I've retained some direct transformations like the `tanh` and `sigmoid` applied to the core numerical features to account for nonlinear relationships.
- Stand-scaling and quantile transformations are used to handle skewness and outliers.
- Interaction terms such as `f5 f9 *` and `f8 f14 *` help capture relationships between features.
- I've incorporated some complex feature transformations like `f2 f4 f5 * + cos` and `f7 f2 + sigmoid minmax_scaler` to explore various nonlinear interactions and scaling effects.
- Retained some of the useful transformations from the examples while adding a couple of new ones to increase complexity and capture various feature interactions.
