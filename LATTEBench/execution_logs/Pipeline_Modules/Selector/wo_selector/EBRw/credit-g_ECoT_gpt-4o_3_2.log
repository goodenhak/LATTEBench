2025-09-27 19:52:39,579 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set that is better than the previous examples, we need to create features that not only enhance the prediction capacity but also introduce complexity in a measured manner. Below is a new feature set that builds upon the given examples:

```plaintext
[f0, f4, f14, f19, f8 f1 *, f8 f5 *, f8 f12 *, f8 f13 *, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f4 reciprocal, f16 reciprocal, f8 f5 * f8 f6 * -, f16 sin, f19 f0 *, f19 f1 *, f19 f4 *, f19 f12 *, f19 f8 f4 * *, f19 f8 f6 * *, f8 f12 * f0 *, f8 f12 * f1 *, f8 f12 * f4 *, f8 f12 * f11 *, f8 f12 * f13 *, square f8 f12 * f11 *, log f0 reciprocal f19 *, tanh f18 f4 cos, f3 reciprocal cube, sqrt f1 reciprocal, sqrt f19 reciprocal, reciprocal f8 f5 * , square f0 reciprocal f4 cos, minmax_scaler f19 f0 *, minmax_scaler f4 f14 cos]
```

### Explanation:

1. The new feature set integrates advanced transformations such as `square`, `log`, `tanh`, and `cube`, which can capture non-linear patterns and interactions in the data.
2. The use of `sqrt` and `minmax_scaler` helps in stabilizing variance and normalization, respectively, which can improve model performance.
3. Combinations like `log f0 reciprocal f19 *` and `square f0 reciprocal f4 cos` are meant to capture complex interactions between variables.
4. `minmax_scaler f19 f0 *` and `minmax_scaler f4 f14 cos` are examples of scaling that can be useful in balancing the range of values, thus potentially improving the model's learning behavior.

This feature set is designed to provide a richer, more complex representation of the data while maintaining the potential benefits seen in the original feature transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The newly added features are:

- **f0 log minmax_scaler**: Applying log transformation followed by min-max scaling to f0. Log transformations can help normalize data, particularly when dealing with right-skewed distributions.

- **f4 / minmax_scaler minmax_scaler**: Dividing f4 by a factor and then applying minmax_scaler again can help adjust the scale and maintain proportional relationships between features useful for models sensitive to feature scales.

Here's a new feature set:

```

In this feature set:
- I added transformations like `cube` and `reciprocal` which might capture non-linear relationships and interactions.
- Combined some existing feature transformations such as `f0 sigmoid cube` to explore higher-degree transformations.
- Included interaction terms like `f0 f4 * cube` to capture the interaction effects between multiple features.

This new set attempts to enhance the variety of transformations while including non-linear interactions that might be useful for prediction tasks.

This includes some post-processing transformation patterns which can be used to capture non-linear relationships and interactions among features, offering rich information potentially useful for improving model predictions.

1. Retain original feature transformations from the given examples.
2. Introduce combined operations involving scaling, transformations, and non-linear functions, which may help capture complex patterns in the data.
3. Mix transformations from different feature sets to synthesize potentially more informative features.

```

In this feature set:
- We maintain the most important original features, ensuring diverse categorical and numerical data.
- We utilize operations like sigmoid, sqrt, sin, and cos to capture potential nonlinear relationships.
- "stand_scaler" and "minmax_scaler" are used for standardization and scaling to stabilize modeling performance.
- Interaction terms and combinations are included from both original sets to introduce more complex patterns.
- The set remains concise to prevent overfitting and maintain interpretability.

Here’s a refined feature set, enhancing variety and potential effectiveness:

- We've retained many features from the previous examples since they incorporate useful transformations like `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, and `stand_scaler`.
- Added new transformations like `f1 f4 * sqrt`, `f0 f4 + log`, `f0 cube reciprocal`, `f0 cube sqrt` that provide additional diversity, focusing on creating non-linear transformations important for complex relationships.
- Retained the comprehensive mix of transformations across different features, maximizing the potential utility of the feature engineering approach.

2025-09-27 19:55:07,691 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, we need to develop new features that could potentially improve predictive performance. The goal is to design features that capture important interactions, transformations, or scaling of the original features. Here's a new, enhanced feature set combining aspects from both examples, focusing on meaningful transformations and interactions:

```plaintext
[f0, f2, f3, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f13 cos, f14 tanh, f15 log, f18 cube, f0 f5 * cos, f1 f7 * sin, f4 f9 - minmax_scaler, f0 f3 / sqrt, f5 f6 + cube, f2 f11 - log, f10 f18 * minmax_scaler, f1 f4 * sin, f3 f15 * tanh, f13 cube sqrt, f2 f16 /, f4 f6 * reciprocal, f9 stand_scaler, f12 f14 stand_scaler cube, f0 f5 stand_scaler * sin]
```

In this set:
- I included various transformations such as `sqrt`, `cube`, `log`, and interactions like multiplication `*` and division `/`.
- The `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `reciprocal` operations standardize or normalize data which can help some models perform better.
- Included trigonometric transformations and hyperbolic functions (`cos`, `sin`, `tanh`) which can capture non-linear interaction effects.
- New feature combinations are created by pairing and transforming features that relate semantically or could be meaningful in relation to the target (e.g., interaction between credit amounts and payment commitments or transformations on duration and age).

This approach is based on the notion that useful features often manifest through complex relationships or normalized individual feature behavior in the data.

- Sigmoid transformations of all features for non-linear scaling.
- Multiplicative interactions between each feature and `f18` to capture potential nonlinear interactions with this feature, followed by a `sigmoid` transformation.
- A set of feature pairwise products to capture interactions between potentially significant pairs.
- Arithmetic combinations of feature pairs followed by a `sigmoid` to introduce non-linearity.
- Combined interactions using multiple features to capture more complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-27 19:55:43,715 - INFO - llm output = Sure, let's create a more refined feature set using the given examples. We aim to generate features that are meaningful transformations, potentially reducing redundancy and capturing complex interactions or distributions. Here is a new and improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,

 f0 f19 * stand_scaler f1 - square cos sigmoid +,
 f9 f8 + sqrt,
 f0 f19 * reciprocal sqrt +,
 f0 stand_scaler sqrt,
 f5 tanh sin,
 f0 sigmoid cos sigmoid +,
 f4 reciprocal sqrt +,
 f4 stand_scaler sigmoid +]
 ```

This new feature set combines operations across both examples and adds more diversity by including transformations such as `sqrt`, `tanh`, and combinations plus additional pairwise interactions. This feature set aims to capture various non-linear relationships in the data, providing a potential boost to model performance.

The goal is to create informative features with the potential to improve model predictions. Here's an attempt to create a "better" artificial feature set by combining insights from both example sets:

- Combined consistent features from both sets.
- Included various mathematical transformations and scaling effects.
- Chose significant sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activations to provide non-linear value transformations that could benefit the model hypothesis space.
- Added cosine-based transformations for periodic-related characteristic discovery.

2025-09-27 19:56:15,658 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, I'll aim to retain valuable features from both sets and apply meaningful transformations that can enhance the predictive power. Let's ensure that we balance complexity and the potential of capturing underlying data patterns.

Here's a proposed improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f11 ,f14 ,f19 ,f1 cos ,f2 cos ,f4 cos ,f5 cos ,f6 cos ,f11 cos ,f15 cos ,f17 cos ,f18 f0 - ,f18 f1 - ,f18 f2 - ,f18 f3 - ,f18 f4 - ,f18 f5 - ,f18 f11 - ,f18 f14 - ,f18 f15 - ,f6 cos sqrt ,f1 cos sqrt ,f4 cos sqrt ,f5 cos sqrt ,f18 f0 - minmax_scaler ,f18 f1 - minmax_scaler ,f18 f4 - minmax_scaler ,f18 f5 - minmax_scaler ,f13 cos minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Selected Features:**
   - Kept original features such as `f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f11, f14, f19` that might be basic input features.
   - Used common transformations like cosine on features that were found in both sets (`f1 cos`, `f2 cos`, `f4 cos`, `f5 cos`, `f6 cos`, etc.), assuming trigonometric transformations could help in capturing periodic patterns.
   - Retained transformed differences like `f18 f0 -`, `f18 f1 -`, which can show deviations or relative differences.
   - Included square root transformations on some cosine-transformed features for nonlinear patterns.

2. **Enhanced Transformations:**
   - Added `minmax_scaler` transformations on specific derived features (`f18 f0 -`, `f18 f1 -`, `f18 f4 -`, `f18 f5 -`, `f13 cos`) to ensure they are on a consistent scale, which can improve convergence in some machine learning models.

3. **Balance of Complexity:**
   - The proposed feature set ensures complexity doesn't overwhelm the model by removing more complex transformations that might not provide significant additional value, like `cube` from the first example, but retains a broad variety of useful features and transformations.

This approach provides a more effective set of features by leveraging aspects from both given examples, seeking to capture important data dynamics through mathematical transformations while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

This feature set includes:

1. Original features from both examples.
2. Reciprocal transformations for some features to capture potential inverse relationships.
3. Sine transformations to model cyclical relationships.
4. Quantile transformation for non-linear scaling to a uniform distribution, which can be effective for non-Gaussian distributions.
5. Interactions between features using multiplication and subtraction to capture combined effects.
6. Sigmoid transformation combined with quantile transform and reciprocal transformations to handle skewness and non-linear relations.
7. A useful feature interaction from example two that leverages addition and sine subtraction for feature `f18`. 

By combining these transformations, this feature set better captures complex relationships and non-linearities, potentially improving performance in predictive models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
