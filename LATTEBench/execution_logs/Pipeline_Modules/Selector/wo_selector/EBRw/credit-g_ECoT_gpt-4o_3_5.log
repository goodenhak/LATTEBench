2025-09-28 23:19:20,596 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set than the ones provided, we'll aim to incorporate both recent techniques like transformations (e.g., standard scaling, min-max scaling, quantile transformation) and advanced feature interactions. We'll strive for more expressive features by utilizing combinations of transformations and interactions.

Here is the new feature set:
```plaintext
[f0, f2, f4, f0 tanh, f2 tanh, f4 tanh, f0 stand_scaler tanh, f1 stand_scaler tanh, f2 stand_scaler tanh, f4 stand_scaler tanh, f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f0 reciprocal, f4 reciprocal, f0 stand_scaler reciprocal, f4 stand_scaler reciprocal, f0 minmax_scaler reciprocal, f4 minmax_scaler reciprocal, f0 sin, f1 sin, f4 sin, f0 stand_scaler sin, f2 stand_scaler sin, f4 stand_scaler sin, f0 cube, f4 cube, f0 tanh f4 tanh * f2 tanh +, f0 stand_scaler tanh f4 stand_scaler tanh * f2 stand_scaler tanh +, f0 quan_trans f4 quan_trans * f2 quan_trans +, f0 square, f1 square, f4 square, f0 sin cos, f1 tanh reciprocal sqrt, f3 minmax_scaler reciprocal, f11 minmax_scaler reciprocal, f0 stand_scaler tanh sin]
```
Key aspects of this feature set:
- Includes standard scaling, min-max scaling, and quantile transformation to handle various distributions.
- Incorporates non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sin`, `cos`, and `reciprocal` to capture complex patterns.
- Introduces feature interactions and polynomial transformations (`*`, `+`, `square`, `cube`) for richer representations.
- Focuses on scaling and transformation interactions to improve stability across different feature ranges.

Explanation:
- Retained high-order transformations like `f0 cube` and `f0 f2 f11 * cube`, as they can capture complex interactions and non-linearities.
- Kept hybrid transformations like `f0 tanh reciprocal f0 f18 - f1 sin f0 sin * tanh * + ...`, which involve multiple mathematical operations that may better encapsulate feature interactions.
- Maintained simpler, informative transformations such as `reciprocal, sqrt, and quan_trans`, which help in normalizing and dealing with different scales.
- Used aggregation operations + and - with transformations to potentially highlight differences and synergies between features.

This new feature set incorporates transformations considering a more diverse set of operations that might help improve predictions by enriching the feature space:

- `f4 f11 * cos` persists from the latter example.
- `f1 f9 * sqrt` uses the square root transformation which could be beneficial in managing linearity.
- `f5 f18 + reciprocal` combines an addition with reciprocal transformation to potentially capture non-linear relationships.

```

In this set:
- I've combined and selected enhanced transformations like `cube`, `quan_trans`, `minmax_scaler`, `sigmoid`, and `sqrt` that are likely to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
- Features with statistical transformations such as `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` help normalize and potentially handle skewness in data distributions.
- Complex features that involve combinations (e.g., `f2 f9 + f0 f11 * - cube reciprocal sqrt`) or apply transformations after operations (e.g., `f1 f10 * reciprocal`) may capture interactions or higher-order effects.
- The set strategically uses cos, reciprocal, and sqrt transformations to explore more behavior in models and data.

This set aims to offer a diverse and potentially more informative feature space for machine learning tasks focused on credit predictions.

2. `f18 sqrt` - The square root of feature `f18`.
3. `f18 log` - The logarithm (base e) of feature `f18`.

In this new feature set:
- `f1 f6 + log`: Takes the sum of `f1` and `f6` and applies the logarithm to capture potential multiplicative interactions.
- `f9 tanh`: Applies the hyperbolic tangent function to `f9`, useful for handling values in between [-1, 1].
- `f17 cube`: Cubes `f17` to capture non-linear relationships or higher-order effects.
- `f18 sqrt`: Applies the square root to `f18`, useful for handling skewness.
- `f12 f18 minmax_scaler`: Scales the values obtained from the interaction between `f12` and `f18` to a range [0, 1], which can improve convergence in some models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:20:42,709 - INFO - llm output = To create a new and potentially better feature set based on the provided examples, we can aim to incorporate transformations that are complex enough to capture non-linear relationships while still being interpretable enough for the model to utilize effectively. Below is a new feature set constructed by leveraging various transformations, picking ideas from both examples, and introducing some new transformational insight.

```

In the new feature set:

- I've maintained features from both examples for consistency and to ensure that key transformations that have been deemed useful are kept.
- I've added combinations like `f0 f4 + quan_trans` which can capture interactions between different features.
- Included `f3 log`, `f14 sin`, and `f0 reciprocal` which provide transformations for potential non-linear relationships.
- Features like `f5 square` and `f11 cos` are added to enrich the feature set with additional non-linear transformations.
- Used cube transformations for `f9` and `f19` to explore higher-degree polynomial relationships.

These transformations aim to capture underlying complex relationships by injecting non-linearity and interaction into the features, which might help in improving the predictive model's performance.

2025-09-28 23:21:05,044 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two given examples, I will integrate both and attempt to enhance the new feature set while adhering to the rules of postfix expression and best practices in feature transformation. This creation incorporates meaningful transformations and combinations inspired by the previous examples.

Here's the new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,

```

This new feature set incorporates basic features and retains the more complex transformations from both examples, while applying useful nonlinear transformations (like `sin`, `reciprocal`) and quantile transformations that could contribute positively to predictive models. These transformations might help in capturing nonlinearities and distribution-specific patterns in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set:
- We retained features from both sets that seemed relevant, such as element-wise transformations and scalers.
- We introduced some interactions between features using operations like division, multiplication, logarithms, and normalization scalers to uncover potential hidden patterns that might not be obvious in the raw features.
- Combining and sequencing transformations could help expose more detailed characteristics and relationships within the data, potentially improving the prediction quality.

Key considerations made in this optimization:
1. Utilize a mix of standard scaling and non-linear transformations (e.g., cube, reciprocal, cos, tanh, sqrt) to capture intricate patterns.
2. Include interactions between features (e.g., `f0 f2 f9 + - cube cos` and `f2 f11 * cube reciprocal sqrt`) to leverage potentially meaningful synergies.
3. Combine transformations with scaling (e.g., `f0 minmax_scaler`) to ensure all features are on a similar scale, reducing the dominance of features with larger numerical ranges.
4. Balance complexity: Some operations of higher complexity mix with more straightforward transformations to avoid overfitting while capturing non-linear patterns.

### Explanation:
- **`f9 log`**: Applying the logarithmic transformation to feature f9 could help normalize skewed data and potentially reveal multiplicative relationships.
- **`f10 square f8 sin *`**: Squaring feature f10 and multiplying by the sine of feature f8 may capture non-linear interactions between these features.
- **`f13 tanh`**: Applying the tanh function to feature f13 can help in scaling the feature to a range between -1 and 1, which could be useful if f13 has large outliers or is skewed.
- **`f11 minmax_scaler f4 /`**: Normalizing feature f11 using min-max scaling and dividing by f4 could help contrast the influence of these two features on the outcome.
- **`f6 f7 * f2 reciprocal +`**: Multiplying feature f6 and f7 and then adding the reciprocal of f2 could help capture interaction effects and inverse relationships.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f19 f2 + sin ,f0 reciprocal f0 - sin ,f9 sin ,f19 sin ,f18 sin]

2025-09-28 23:21:59,448 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions based on your given examples, I'll generate a new feature set leveraging transformations that may capture non-linear relationships and scale the data appropriately:

Example Feature Set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f4 f11 * cos ,f8 cos ,f18 stand_scaler ,f18 f18 *, f3 sqrt f6 +, f14 f14 cube]
```

Explanation:
1. Preserved features: All original features are kept in line with your requirement.
2. Transformed features: 
   - `f4 f11 * cos`: Applies cosine transformation to the product of `f4` and `f11`, potentially capturing cyclical patterns.
   - `f8 cos`: Applies cosine transformation to `f8`, exploring non-linear periodic relationships.
   - `f18 stand_scaler`: Feature `f18` is standardized to help normalize data distributions.
   - `f18 f18 *`: Squaring `f18` to capture potential quadratic relationships.
   - `f3 sqrt f6 +`: Square root of `f3`, then added to `f6` to create feature interactions that may reveal hidden connections.
   - `f14 f14 cube`: Cubing `f14` to explore higher-order interactions and intensify non-linear effects inherent to the feature.

The combination of these transformations aims to enhance modeling capabilities by incorporating various feature interactions and normalizations, facilitating better predictive performance.
