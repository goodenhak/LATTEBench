**Explanation:**
1. **Use of Mathematical Transforms:** Utilization of operations such as `sqrt`, `log`, `cube`, `reciprocal`, and `sigmoid` to improve scale and normalization, which can help linear models capture non-linear relationships.

2. **Use of stand_scaler/minmax_scaler:** These scaling methods are applied to different combinations to help adjust the feature scales, making them suitable for various models, especially those sensitive to feature scales.

3. **Interactions of Features:** Combination of features such as `f0 f7 + sqrt` and `f3 f7 + minmax_scaler` can capture interactions between features; these can reveal patterns that might be indicative of heart disease.

4. **Stress Mathematical Functions:** Functions like `tanh` applied on `f7` to observe saturation behavior, and `sigmoid` on `f10`, make the transformations capture specific behaviors in data trends.

These translations provide a robust feature set leveraging diverse mathematical transformations and scaling methods to extract meaningful information for predicting heart disease.

Here's a suggested feature set that enhances the previous examples:

In this feature set:
- We've retained complex non-linear transformations such as combinations of `sqrt`, `square`, `tanh`, and `log`, which can help capture intricate relationships.
- We introduced scaling procedures like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` which normalizes range and scales features, potentially improving model training.
- We included `sigmoid` and `reciprocal` transformations to create non-linear relationships.
- We've maintained some simpler product and addition combinations for linear relationships.

This feature set provides a broad exploration of both linear and non-linear transformations to capture various underlying relationships in the data for better heart disease prediction.

Let's create a new feature set by taking relevant transformed features and enhancing them with additional transformations or operations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f8 quan_trans sqrt, f2 sqrt, f9 sqrt sqrt, f10 minmax_scaler, f2 f9 sqrt - sqrt minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f8 square sqrt sqrt, f2 sqrt f9 sqrt - sqrt, f9 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f2 f9 sqrt - sqrt sqrt cos, f8 sqrt sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt]
```

In this feature set:
- The original features `f0` to `f12` are sometimes necessary as they provide the base values for transformations.
- Transformed features such as `f8 quan_trans sqrt` and `f8 square sqrt sqrt` employ quantile transformation and square root operations which may help adjust distribution and non-linear interactions.
- Features like `f9 minmax_scaler` and `f10 minmax_scaler` help normalize feature ranges, which is beneficial for models sensitive to feature scales.
- Complex transformations like `f2 sqrt f9 sqrt - sqrt` capture interactions between features with non-linear transformations.
- Using trigonometric functions like `cos` on transformed features (`f2 f9 sqrt - sqrt sqrt cos`) and scaling (`f8 sqrt sqrt`) may help in feature enrichment by capturing periodic patterns.

The chosen transformations aim to provide robust input features for a predictive model by covering a wide range of transformation types and thereby potentially capturing complex interactions in the data.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

When generating new features for predictive tasks, the goal is usually to enhance the information available to the model by transforming existing features in meaningful ways. Based on the given examples, I will create a better feature set by using additional transformations and combinations:

```
[f0 sqrt, f1 sin, f2 sqrt , f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f3 f8 * , f3 f10 * , f8 sqrt sqrt , f3 f8 * sqrt , f2 f9 - , f2 sqrt f9 - , f2 sqrt f9 sqrt - , f8 sqrt f9 - , f8 sqrt f9 sqrt - , f10 sqrt f9 - , f3 f2 * f9 - , f3 f2 * f9 sqrt - , f3 f8 * f9 - , f3 f8 * f9 sqrt - , f3 f10 * f9 - , f3 f10 * f9 sqrt - , f3 f8 * sqrt sqrt , f8 sqrt sqrt sqrt , f2 sqrt sqrt , f7 f2 * sqrt , f7 f10 * sqrt , f10 sqrt sqrt , f3 f10 * sqrt , f9 sqrt sqrt, f0 f11 * sqrt, f7 f2 f9 sqrt *]
```

In this improved feature set:

- Added `f0 sqrt` and `f1 sin` which applies square root and sine transformations to potentially capture non-linear relationships.
- Included an interaction term `f0 f11 * sqrt` to capture potential interactions between features with a square root transformation.
- Added `f7 f2 f9 sqrt *` to combine multiple features into an interaction, potentially revealing hidden relationships.

These transformations aim to bring out non-linear patterns and interactions that may not be directly captured through the original features, thus enhancing the predictive power of the model.

2025-10-21 20:08:24,961 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and the goal of improving prediction accuracy, let's create a new feature set by taking the best aspects from both examples and introducing some additional transformations that could further enhance predictive power. We'll try to capture more complex interactions and feature transformations.

Here is a proposed improved feature set:

``` 
[f0 ,f2 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f9 tanh ,f8 sqrt tanh ,f2 square tanh ,f8 square tanh ,f9 square tanh ,f1 cos ,f2 cos ,f5 cos ,f8 cos ,f9 cos ,f10 cos ,f7 sqrt ,f9 tanh sqrt ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f8 reciprocal ,f9 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal ,f2 square tanh sqrt ,f8 square tanh sqrt ,f9 square tanh sqrt ,f1 cos sqrt ,f2 log ,f8 log ,f9 log ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Retained original features (`f0`, `f2`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`)**: These are the raw features that offer a baseline level of predictive information. 
- **Non-linear transformations (`tanh`, `sqrt`, `cos`)**: These transformations capture non-linear relationships in the data. 
- **Reciprocal transformations**: Added `f8 reciprocal`, `f9 reciprocal`, `f10 reciprocal` to incorporate the inverse effect, which can sometimes highlight relationships in data where a higher score means less risk.
- **Log transformations**: Introduced `f2 log`, `f8 log`, `f9 log` as logarithmic transformations can help in managing skewness and revealing multiplicative relationships.
- **Min-max scaling**: Added `f2 minmax_scaler`, `f9 minmax_scaler`, `f10 minmax_scaler` to transform features to a 0-1 range, which may help some algorithms in converging faster and handling different scales in data.

This new feature set tries to leverage a balanced combination of both non-linear and linear transformations, scaling, and feature interactions. The added transformations allow the model to potentially capture more complex patterns in the dataset that are indicative of heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-10-21 20:08:39,401 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set based on the previous two examples, I'll aim to integrate elements that capture potential interactions, non-linearity, or acquired insights from basic transformations. Here's the improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f2 sqrt cos, f8 quan_trans sqrt, f9 sqrt sqrt tanh, f10 minmax_scaler, f2 f9 sqrt - log minmax_scaler, f8 square sqrt sqrt sqrt, f2 sqrt f9 sqrt - sqrt, f9 reciprocal, f2 f9 sqrt - sqrt sqrt cos, f3 f8 * f9 - sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt log, f3 f8 * sqrt cube]
```

Explanation:
1. **f2 sqrt cos**: Applying cosine transformation on the square root of f2 to capture cyclic or oscillatory patterns.
2. **f8 quan_trans sqrt**: Keeping this feature from the second set as it involves quantile transformation and square root, which can improve distribution characteristics.
3. **f9 sqrt sqrt tanh**: Using hyperbolic tangent on the double square root of f9 can help in stabilizing variations and making gradients smoother.
4. **f10 minmax_scaler**: Normalization through min-max scaling for f10, retained from the sets.
5. **f2 f9 sqrt - log minmax_scaler**: Added logarithmic transformation to the subtraction of square roots followed by min-max scaling, which may stabilize variance and make the data more fitting for certain models.
6. **f8 square sqrt sqrt sqrt**: Further stabilization through nested roots on a squared term of f8.
7. **f2 sqrt f9 sqrt - sqrt**: Preserves the original characteristic with additional square root stabilizing.
8. **f9 reciprocal**: Introducing reciprocal to bring high values lower, which might be useful for linear models.
9. **f2 f9 sqrt - sqrt sqrt cos**: Ensuring complex interactions by combination of cosine with nested square roots on the f2 and f9 difference.
10. **f3 f8 * f9 - sqrt**: Multiplicative interaction followed by subtraction and square root to reduce complex feature magnitudes.
11. **f10 sqrt sqrt log**: Provides smooth transformations that can stabilize variability and scale effectively.
12. **f3 f8 * sqrt cube**: Capturing high-order interactions and increasing the weight of this interaction by cubing.

In this improved set:
- I retained diverse transformations such as `sqrt`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `quan_trans`, and `stand_scaler` to capture non-linear relationships, ensure feature scaling, and improve normalization.
- I included complex combinations from the original sets where several transformations are compounded to potentially capture intricate data patterns.
- I prioritized transformations that are used multiple times across features to maintain diversity and leverage existing patterns.

This set aims to maintain a balance between complexity and comprehensiveness to potentially improve model predictive performance.

2025-10-21 20:08:54,998 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the two examples, we should aim to include transformations that are potentially more informative while taking into account the behaviors of the existing features. Here's a new feature set that builds on the previous ones:

``` 
[f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f2 f3 / ,f2 f7 / ,f8 f7 / ,f9 f7 / ,f8 cube ,f9 cube ,f10 cube ,f8 sqrt cube ,f10 sqrt cube ,f8 quan_trans ,f8 sqrt quan_trans ,f10 sqrt quan_trans ,f8 tanh ,f8 f3 / tanh ,f8 f7 / tanh ,f9 f7 / tanh ,f8 cube sqrt ,f8 f7 / sqrt ,f9 f7 / sqrt ,f10 f3 / sqrt ,f9 cube sqrt ,f8 f3 / sqrt ,f9 f8 + sqrt sqrt ,f9 f8 + sqrt sigmoid ,f8 reci sqrt, f7 f4 / f8 + sqrt + tanh ,f9 f8 + sqrt f10 + tanh ,f9 f8 + sqrt f10 + ,f9 sqrt sqrt ,f8 sqrt sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt ,f9 f8 / sqrt ,f7 sqrt sqrt , f9 f8 + sqrt f7 f4 / f8 + sqrt + sqrt sqrt sqrt ] 
```

In this feature set:
- Enhanced transformations from the second set are retained and refined.
- Some new transformations involve cube and reciprocal operations, aiming to capture nonlinear relationships.
- Several combinations leverage addition and division to identify significant interactions amongst features.
- Use of tanh and sigmoid is continued for their capability to normalize and potentially non-linear transform data.
- Multiple uses of sqrt (square root) for smoothing and reducing the range of features potentially amplify linearity.
- Integration of a few interactions not seen previously as directly can help potentially highlight multivariate relationships in data that classical transformations might skip. 

The focus is now both on refining feature engineering using the characteristics from both given sets, while enhancing it with new potentially useful transformations.

Additionally, expressions like `[f10 sqrt f8 sigmoid sqrt +]` and `[f3 tanh f9 sqrt +]` are included to capture potential interactions and non-linear behaviors between numerical and transformed features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's an improved feature set:

### Explanation:
1. **Diverse Basic Features**: Retained a wide range of the original features to capture baseline information.
2. **Complex Combinations**: Incorporated expressions using `+`, `/`, and complex functions like `tanh` and `sigmoid` to form interactions that might reveal non-linear patterns.
3. **Advanced Transformations**: Continued use of `sqrt`, `cube`, and juxtaposition of transformations and scaling operations to address the presence of non-linearities and the role of scale in prediction accuracy.
4. **Consideration of All Variables**: Compared to previous examples, included all available features, assuming `f11` and `f12` are relevant new features not explicitly detailed but needed for completeness of the dataset.

This new feature set seeks to balance the complexity and non-linearity of the output features without overly complicating the model, potentially leading to improved generalizability and predictive performance for the presence of heart disease.

```

### Explanation 
1. Existing useful features are retained, like the square root and interaction terms, given their potential to capture inherent non-linearity.
   
2. ``[f4 sqrt]``: Taking the square root of cholesterol levels can normalize skewness found in such metrics.

3. ``[f3 f4 + sqrt]``: The combination of resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels, followed by a square root, can highlight interplay effects while moderating extreme values.
   
4. ``[f7 f2 * /]``: This divides the heart rate by age, which might be indicative of relative physiological capability or stress level disparities among differing age cohorts. Another insightful perspective might apply square root for normalization. 

5. ``[f5 f6 /]`` and ``[f6 f5 - sqrt]``: These features bring fasting blood sugar (whether high) into perspective with the restecg results—attempting to link heart electrical activity changes with blood sugar variability.

This new feature set leverages complex transformations with basic domain intuition, potentially enhancing the predictive power of the model significantly.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-10-21 20:09:27,475 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and the task at hand, the goal is to create a better feature set that will help in predicting the presence of heart disease more effectively. For better predictive power, it is essential to choose transformations that help normalize data distributions, highlight differences in non-linear relationships, and emphasize key characteristics of the original features.

Here is an improved feature set based on your examples:

``` 
[f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f10 sqrt sqrt ,f10 sqrt cube ,f0 reciprocal sqrt ,f9 sqrt cube ,f9 reciprocal sqrt ,f10 stand_scaler ,f8 log ,f9 log ,f11 log ,f12 log ,f2 quan_trans ,f9 quan_trans ,f9 cube f8 + sqrt sqrt ,f4 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f9 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f7 sqrt sqrt ,f10 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f10 tanh ,f8 sigmoid ,f9 sigmoid ]
```

In this set:
- The reciprocal and cube transformations have been applied to emphasize variation in crucial numerical features.
- Logarithmic and square root transformations bring potential skewed distributions closer to normality.
- Standard scaler and quantile transformer are useful for normalizing features over a set range and for non-parametric transformation.
- Sigmoid and tanh transformations can help capture non-linear relationships in the data, particularly for features with unknown distributions. 
- The inclusion of original features keeps fundamental information for further use in downstream tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

Explanation of transformations used:
- **Non-linear transformations** (e.g., `sqrt`, `cube`, `square`, `tanh`): These capture non-linear relationships which might be crucial for prediction.
- **Statistical scalers** (e.g., `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`): These help to normalize and bucket the data, reducing the impact of outliers and highlighting the distribution shape.
- **Mathematical operations** (e.g., `*`, `+`, `-`): Enhance interaction between features, potentially revealing synergies in data relationships.
- **Complex combinations** (e.g., `sqrt sin`, `cube sqrt sqrt`): Aim to discover complex patterns that are not evident with simple linear relationships.
- **Feature reduction** (removal and addition of significant features): Each feature tries to leverage important aspects of the original data, like blood pressure (`f4`), chest pain (`f2`), and exercise blockers like `exang` (`f8`), potentially in more informative forms.

This feature set offers a mix of transformed, combined, and scaled features designed to better predict the presence of heart disease.

I will also ensure the transformation doesn't overly complicate the model unnecessarily. Here's a new feature set based on the better aspects of both, with a focus on transformations that are likely to capture useful patterns:

2. **`(f9 / f8) sqrt`**: Interaction between `f9` and `f8` aimed at capturing a relationship indicated by the ratio, followed by a square root to normalize the interaction scale.

These transformations consider both the non-linear nature of the features and potential interactions while seeking to remain parsimonious and interpretable.

The latter example shows an increasing use of sequential transformations like `stand_scaler` and `sqrt`, often combined with other nonlinear operations.

```

### Explanation of Key Transformations:

1. **Non-Linear Transformation:** Used operations like `sqrt`, `sin`, and `tanh` to capture non-linear relationships in the data, which could improve model accuracy for non-linear classification boundaries.
  
2. **Combined Features:** Combined features such as `f2 sqrt f9 sqrt - sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt f8 sigmoid sqrt + sqrt sqrt sqrt acos` to capture interactions among features, hinting at complex dependencies.

3. **Log and Reciprocal Transformations:** Applied log and reciprocal operations (`f0 log`, `f0 reciprocal sqrt`, `f10 reciprocal`) to address skewness and emphasize smaller values, enhancing interpretability and robustness.

4. **Scaling:** Utilized `minmax_scaler` to normalize feature values (`f0 minmax_scaler sqrt`), which is useful for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

5. **Advanced Trigonometric Functions:** Introduced `acos` for its sensitivity in periods or angular dissimilarities between features.

Enhancing prediction capability involves experimentation with different feature combinations and transformations, making sure to validate these engineered features against the validation or test sets for performance improvements.

2025-10-21 20:10:47,169 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set based on the given examples, we aim to create a more informative and diverse set of features to improve the predictive performance for the presence of heart disease. I'll combine elements from both examples and introduce additional transformations to enrich the feature set:

``` 
[f0, f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f9 tanh, f8 sqrt tanh, f2 square tanh, f8 square tanh, f9 square tanh, f1 cos, f2 cos, f5 cos, f8 cos, f9 cos, f10 cos, f7 sqrt, f9 tanh sqrt, f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f1 cos sqrt, f2 square tanh sqrt, f8 square tanh sqrt, f9 square tanh sqrt, f0 log, f8 reciprocal]
```

### Explanation:
1. I retained the basic features (`f0`, `f2`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`) and those that undergo transformations like `tanh`, `sqrt tanh`, `cos`, and `cos sqrt` as they appear in both sets.
2. I included a logarithmic transformation (`f0 log`) for `age` as it can help in dealing with skewness.
3. I added a reciprocal transformation (`f8 reciprocal`) for `exang` to perhaps highlight inverse relationships or anomalies.
4. Retained various combinations of square and tanh transformations for features linked to heart rate and pressure (`f2`, `f8`, and `f9`) as they may reveal non-linear relationships.
5. The selection includes square roots and cosine transformations which can be useful in distorting the scales to amplify differences that might be subtle in linear features.

- Added the feature `f2 f3 / sqrt`: Incorporating division of features f2 and f3, followed by square root, which was present in the latter example is carried over.
- Retained features that involve combinations using `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `cube` as they capture non-linear relationships which might enhance the model's performance.
- Added interaction features and transformations such as `f8 f9 / sqrt`, `f9 tanh`, `f8 reciprocal sqrt`, `f8 log`, and `f9 log` to capture more intricate patterns in the data.
- Ensured that helpful transformations like `tanh`, `sqrt`, and `quan_trans` are consistently applied across different feature interactions to better model non-linear relationships and distribution normalizations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

### Explanation:

- Retained the majority of features from both sets as they account for a variety of transformations (trigonometric, scaling, square, etc.) which could enhance predictive ability.
- Added a couple of logarithmic and reciprocal transformations (`f2 log`, `f8 reciprocal`) to capture potential nonlinear relationships in features `f2` and `f8`.
- Included the `stand_scaler` for `f9` and `minmax_scaler` for `f10` to ensure these numerical features are standardized and within a consistent range, respectively. Such scaling is common in machine learning pipelines to improve model performance and convergence.
- The selection was aimed at covering diverse types of transformations, ensuring adequate feature diversity, and aligned with common practices in feature engineering for prediction tasks.
