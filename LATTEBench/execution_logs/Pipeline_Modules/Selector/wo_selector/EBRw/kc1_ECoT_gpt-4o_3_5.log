you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:29:26,350 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! To improve the feature set based on the given examples and transformations, we will apply additional transformations and aim to enhance the feature set's predictive capabilities by incorporating some non-linear transformations and scaling techniques. From the examples, we notice the use of functions such as `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, division, and addition. Given that the second list likely implies a more advanced feature set, we can build upon that by exploring further transformations.

Here's a possible improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f7 f8 / ,f16 minmax_scaler ,f7 f7 + ,f7 stand_scaler ,f0 log ,f1 sqrt ,f8 tanh ,f9 cube ,f19 sigmoid ,f18 f9 /]
```

Explanation for additional transformations:
- `f0 log`: Taking the logarithm of `f0` can help in managing skewness for features with large ranges.
- `f1 sqrt`: The square root transformation can reduce the variability and stabilize variance.
- `f8 tanh`: Applying hyperbolic tangent to `f8` enhances non-linear transformations.
- `f9 cube`: Cubing `f9` can capture interactions or emphasize larger values.
- `f19 sigmoid`: Using the sigmoid function can help squash values between 0 and 1, making them suitable for models sensitive to scale.
- `f18 f9 /`: This ratio could highlight relationships between `f18` and `f9` by comparing their magnitudes.

These transformations build upon the earlier examples and should contribute more complex interactions and non-linear relationships, potentially improving the prediction task's accuracy and robustness.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:29:31,896 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, I'll create a better feature set while incorporating transformations to enhance predictive power. The transformations applied should be in line with techniques that could capture complex relationships or normalize/standardize key features.

Here's a suggested feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f6 f6 + log, f16 stand_scaler reciprocal, f16 quan_trans f16 + sqrt]
```

### Explanation:

1. **f6 f6 + log**: Taking the sum of `f6` with itself and applying the logarithm can highlight proportional changes and compresses the range.
2. **f16 stand_scaler reciprocal**: Normalizing `f16` and taking the reciprocal accentuates the influence of smaller values and mitigates the influence of larger ones.
3. **f16 quan_trans f16 + sqrt**: Applying quantile transformation followed by a summation with the original, then applying square root, can stabilize variance and provide a nonlinear expansion capturing implicit rankings/quantiles.

These transformations focus on utilizing:
- Squaring and square roots to introduce non-linearity.
- Logarithmic transformations to manage skewness.
- Standardization and quantile scaling for bringing features to a common scale.
- Reciprocals to invert the scale and emphasize smaller values.

This combination seeks to capture and enhance intricate patterns that may contribute to better defect prediction.

Summary:
- Maintained complex interactions like `f3 f10 *` and `f4 f8 *` for their potential utility in capturing code-level intricacies.
- Included `tanh` and `cos` transformations for capturing non-linear characteristics and periodicity.
- Leveraged `quan_trans` and `sqrt` to normalize and stabilize variance while capturing significance in `f4 f8 *` and `f8 f10 *`.
- Added `f8 f9 * f8 f9 * * ` for higher-order interactions and non-linear effects, and included `f8 f9 * reciprocal` for inversion relationship insights.

This feature set aims to encapsulate domain-specific transformations and interactions to enhance predictive power.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f0 f18 /, f6 f9 * tanh, f11 f12 + log, f10 f5 * square, f16 cube, f16 f7 -, f0 f1 stand_scaler, f7 f8 minmax_scaler, f14 f15 tanh, f3 f17 + cube, f5 f6 + reciprocal, f8 f9 / sigmoid, f13 log, f20 log]
```

Here's a breakdown of some transformations:
- `f0 f18 /`: This could highlight relationships where ratios are important.
- `f6 f9 * tanh`: Non-linear interaction between features, scaled by `tanh`.
- `f11 f12 + log`: Log transformation to adjust skewness supporting linear models.
- `f0 f1 stand_scaler`: Standardizing differences between features `f0` and `f1`.
- `f7 f8 minmax_scaler`: Scaling to a defined range helps with convergence speed in models.
- `f5 f6 + reciprocal`: Combined features under reciprocal transformation for non-linear effects.
- `f8 f9 / sigmoid`: Contextual scaling by using a sigmoid after ratio, beneficial for logistic-looking data structures.

This better feature set aims to enhance the potential of discovering significant patterns in the data relevant to predicting software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:29:55,561 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples you provided, I will combine concepts from both to create an improved feature set. The first example emphasizes standard scaling and reciprocal transformations, while the second example incorporates quantile transformations and a variety of activation functions like tanh and sigmoid. I'll blend these strategies to produce a new feature set that integrates the diverse transformations and augmentations provided.

Here's the improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

In this set:
- I've retained diverse feature transformations such as **quantile transformation**, **reciprocal**, **sigmoid**, and **logarithmic scaling** to capture a range of data characteristics.
- Various mathematical operations (e.g., addition, division) are used to create interactions between features.
- I've included some features with basic operations like **sin** and **tanh** to incorporate non-linearities.
- To manage feature scaling, **standard scaling** and **min-max scaling** have been applied to selected interactions and transformations.

This approach ensures that the feature set is rich and varied, capturing linear, non-linear, and distribution-based transformations, which are crucial for enhancing model predictions.

The first example employs a variety of transformations, including standardization, min-max scaling, and quantile transformations, as well as arithmetic operations. The second example focuses on using original features with some operations such as quantile transformation and product-based transformations.

Here is a new, potentially better feature set based on the given examples:

1. **Base Features**: All original features `f0` to `f20` from the second example are retained, providing a comprehensive starting point.
   
2. **Arithmetic Operations**:  
   - Subtraction (`f4 f9 -`) and multiplication (`f1 f3 *`) are introduced for simplicity and relevance.
   - Division (`f10 f5 /`) to observe interactions between these features.
   
3. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - Logarithmic transform (`f6 log`), square root (`f7 sqrt`), and cube (`f12 cube`) for compressing or expanding feature scales.
   - Trigonometric functions like `tanh`, `sin`, and `cos` are applied to features to capture non-linear patterns.
   
4. **Scaling and Transformations**:
   - Min-max scaling (`f16 minmax_scaler`) and standard scaling (`f17 stand_scaler`).
   - Reciprocal transform for skewed data (`f18 reciprocal`).
   - Combination of minmax and stand scaling on differences and summations (`f5 f7 - minmax_scaler`, `f2 f14 + stand_scaler`).
   - Quantile transformation on selected product interaction (`f6 f8 * quan_trans`).
   
5. **Complex Interaction**:
   - Complex interaction terms are formed and transformed for better capturing dependencies (`f13 f16 + f17 f19 -`, `f10 f20 /`).

This feature set aims to capture potential non-linear relationships and interactions within the feature space, potentially improving the downstream task's performance.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Statistical and Non-Linear Transformations**: The first few transformations like `f5 f8 + minmax_scaler` use simple arithmetic operations followed by scaling, which can help normalize or standardize the impact of features.

2. **Non-linear transformations**: The use of trigonometric and activation functions (`sin`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`) is intended to capture potential non-linearities in the data which is common in complex datasets like KC1.

3. **Feature Interactions and Combinations**: Several features are combined using arithmetic operations (e.g., `f8 f0 f7 - +`) to explore interactions. Such combinations can reveal relationships between the features that a simple model might miss.

4. **Use of Feature Scaling**: Using scalers like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans` helps in managing the feature distributions, making them more suitable for various algorithms.

This new feature set combines insights from the transformations seen in the examples to help capture potentially useful non-linear interactions while also using scaling to manage feature distributions for better prediction performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-28 23:30:32,130 - INFO - llm output = Based on your request, let's generate a new feature set by combining the features and transformations intelligently from the given examples. We'll aim to reduce dimensionality by maintaining the original feature set for interpretability and add a complex derived feature using transformations to capture interactions and non-linear relationships.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 f1 * f5 f10 * + sqrt minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation
1. **Retain Original Features**: By keeping all the original features \([f0, f1, ..., f20]\), we ensure that the raw interpretable data is available for predictive modeling.

2. **Complex Derived Feature**: We calculate a new feature by multiplying `f0` and `f1` to capture linear interaction, multiplying `f5` and `f10` to capture another interaction, summing these products, and applying square root transformation to normalize the scale. Finally, we apply a `minmax_scaler` to ensure the feature is in a standardized range, enhancing its utility in models sensitive to scale differences (e.g., SVMs, Neural Networks).

This combined approach aims to improve prediction accuracy by providing both foundational data and capturing complex interactions in the software defect dataset.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:30:38,625 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and considering the goal of improving prediction quality, we want to generate a new feature set by leveraging the original features and transformations effectively. 

A better feature set might incorporate a mix of transformations that capture nonlinear relationships, interactions, and scale normalizations while maintaining some of the potentially informative original features. Here's a new feature set proposal:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f12 ,f16 ,f18 ,f19 ,f10 f0 - ,f10 f4 - ,f10 f6 - ,f10 f8 - ,f10 f17 - ,f10 f0 f6 * - ,f10 f4 f6 * - ,f0 f16 - ,f1 f16 - ,f3 f16 - ,f4 f16 - ,f5 f16 - ,f8 f16 - ,f9 f16 - ,f17 f16 - ,f10 f9 - stand_scaler ,f6 f8 + log ,f4 f7 tanh * ,f5 f9 / sin ,f16 sqrt ,f18 log ,f19 reciprocal]
```

Explanation:

- Kept some original features that may hold important baseline information such as `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, etc.
- Included useful linear and nonlinear transformations like subtraction and interaction terms `f10 f0 -`, `f10 f4 -`, `f10 f6 -`, and `f10 f0 f6 * -`.
- Applied scaling `stand_scaler` and `log` transformations to cover a wider data range and potential skew correction.
- Introduced `sqrt`, `log`, `tanh`, `sin`, and `reciprocal` transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Adjusted feature selection to avoid redundancy and ensure a balance between complexity and variance.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 f6 - stand_scaler ,f1 f4 - stand_scaler ,f4 f5 - ,f4 f6 - ,f5 f19 - ,f5 minmax_scaler cosine ,f8 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f19 cos stand_scaler ,f19 reciprocal stand_scaler ,f0 f6 - tanh ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f20 minmax_scaler ,f5 log ,f8 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f11 log]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Standard Scaling and Feature Differences**: Maintaining the standard scaling on the differences as they can help normalize the range, making the model less sensitive to scale, e.g., `f0 f6 - stand_scaler`, `f1 f4 - stand_scaler`.

2. **Feature Transformation with trigonometric functions**: Used cosine to capture periodicity or symmetry aspects, e.g., `f5 minmax_scaler cosine`, `f19 cos stand_scaler`.

3. **Normalization and Scaling**: Continue using `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` on some standalone features to manage scales effectively.

4. **Feature Combination and Reciprocals**: The reciprocal transformation might handle non-linear relationships, e.g., `f19 reciprocal stand_scaler`.

5. **Non-linear Transformations**: Included `log`, `sqrt`, and `tanh` which can stabilize variance across features with heavy-tailed distributions or capture non-linear relationships effectively. E.g., `f5 log`, `f8 sqrt`.

This chosen combination is intended to preserve the variations and relationships within the original data while making the learning algorithm efficient and robust.

2025-09-28 23:30:54,376 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the given examples, we should aim to create a more informative feature transformation that captures additional relevant information for defect prediction. 

Given the progression from Example 1 to Example 2, it seems the focus is on incorporating feature interactions and applying a transformation that enhances the distribution characteristics of the features. Let's add a third transformation to further improve predictive power:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f4 f16 + log quan_trans]
```

### Explanation:
1. **f4 f16 +:** This combines features f4 and f16 by adding them together. This might create a new feature that captures an interaction effect between these two features, which could be significant for prediction.

2. **log:** The logarithm transformation can help normalize the distribution of the combined feature and handle skewness in data, which is often beneficial for linear models or algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

3. **quan_trans:** Applying quantile transformation can further help transform the feature into a normal distribution, which can be especially useful for algorithms like SVM or any that assume features have a Gaussian-like distribution.

```

Explanation:
1. Multiplied relevant combinations of features to capture interactions, such as `f5 f4 *` and `f8 f9 *`, which might capture useful relations in the software defect prediction task.
2. Applied `tanh`, `cos`, and `quan_trans` transformations to existing feature interactions to introduce non-linearities and potential enhancements captured by these transformations.
3. Used square root and subtraction variations to extract finer gradations and differences between important interactions, e.g., `f8 f5 * tanh f8 f9 * -` and `f8 f10 * cos sqrt`.
4. Ensured a balance of transformations across features to utilize the range of possible interactions effectively.

This feature set introduces complexity and interaction effects, leveraging the non-linear transformations to potentially capture more sophisticated patterns associated with software defects.

This feature set integrates transformations like square root, reciprocal, square, and log for specific features and adds combinations using operations like `tanh` and `sigmoid`, aiming to capture non-linear interactions. Meanwhile, it retains differences with subtraction (`-`) to capture distinct relationships. The expanded set aspires to improve model prediction capability by enriching the feature space with meaningful transformations and interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The second example leverages the `minmax_scaler` transformation across various features, which is useful for scaling numerical features into a normalized range, making them potentially more suitable for certain machine learning algorithms. Additionally, it introduces a division operation that could highlight important ratios between features.

This feature set aims to leverage various transformations, including nonlinear transformations like `sin`, `tanh`, and operations such as `log`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, as well as scaling methods (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`). By combining these transformations and interactions among the features, the new feature set strives to enhance the prediction performance for the software defect prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2025-09-28 23:31:25,931 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, one can aim to create a new feature set that is potentially more informative for the downstream task of predicting software defects. The first feature set focuses heavily on transformations involving products of features, while the second set is more straightforward with raw feature selection and one complex transformation. An improved approach would leverage essential transformations and combinations for potential improvement, maintaining a good balance between complexity and interpretability.

Here's a proposed refined feature set:

```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Features (`f0` to `f20`)**: Retaining the individual base features to keep the original information from the data.
   
2. **Complexity and Code Metrics Combined (`f6 f11 * cube`)**: Retains the original complex transformation as it may capture intricate relationships between Halstead's line count features.

3. **Cosine-Square of Combined Metrics (`f4 f8 * cos sqrt`)**: This transformation provides a non-linear complex interaction between Halstead's total operators + operands and Halstead 'intelligence', emphasizing their potential combined effect.

4. **Tanh on Combined Metrics (`f8 f5 * tanh`)**: Leveraging the hyperbolic tangent function on the product of Halstead's 'intelligence' and 'volume' may reveal nonlinear patterns, effectively dealing with outlier values due to its bounded nature.

5. **Quantile Transformation on Effort and Difficulty Product (`f8 f10 * quan_trans`)**: Applying a quantile transformation helps normalize the distribution of the product of Halstead's 'intelligence' and 'difficulty', potentially enhancing features for algorithm sensitivity.

This selection endeavors to maintain a balance of interpretability, potential discovery of complex non-linear interactions, and focusing on transformations that handle skewed distributions.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-09-28 23:31:37,675 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided sets of feature transformations, I will suggest a more advanced transformation that utilizes elements from both while incorporating additional transformations to potentially improve predictive performance. The goal is to explore different transformations and combinations that can provide more meaningful representations for the defect prediction task. 

Here is the newly proposed feature set in postfix notation:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f5 f8 + sqrt f7 log * stand_scaler]
```

This transformation is constructed as follows:
- It incorporates the addition of `f5` and `f8`, followed by a square root transformation, inspired by the first transformation. 
- It further includes a multiplication with the logarithm of `f7`, adding non-linear interaction between features.
- To ensure the scale and distribution of these transformed features are consistent for model training, a standard scaler is applied at the end, similar to the first transformation's scaling strategy.

This approach combines different basic operations and non-linear transformations (e.g., logarithm and square root), as well as a scaling step, potentially capturing more complex patterns that correlate with software defects.

This new set retains and refines useful transformations from both examples: various differences between features, scaling, and trigonometric functions. New operations such as `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` have been strategically included to enrich the feature space further. This expanded feature set aims to capture complex relationships in the data for potentially better predictive performance in the downstream task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This set includes:
1. The transformation `f10 square f8 cos + minmax_scaler` from the latter example, which seems more informative and includes scaling.
2. A product of the square root of `f3` and hyperbolic tangent of `f7`, potentially capturing non-linear interaction effects.
3. A logarithmic transformation of the product `f2 * f18`, which could enhance insights into multiplicative relationships between these features.

Explanation:
- Introduced single transformation features (square, sqrt, reciprocal, log) to address scale/density differences.
- Used sigmoid transformations to potentially capture non-linear relationships.
- Employed tanh, min-max scaler, and reciprocal operations for feature interaction to model interaction effects.
- Introduced cube and square transformations within complex interactions to provide powerful, higher-order feature relationships while retaining manageability through structured operations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:31:58,067 - INFO - llm output = To construct a better feature set utilizing the given operations and examples, let's strategize by combining the beneficial elements from both sets while introducing some improvements. Here are the proposed transformations:

1. Start with incorporating basic features: `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20]`.

2. Incorporate transformations that often enhance model performance:

   - From the first set, use minmax scaling and cube transformations; these can help in stabilizing variance and establishing the non-linearity vital for capturing complex patterns.
   - From the second set, incorporate square and reciprocal-sin interactions that may capture unique relationships.
   - Additionally, explore log and square root transformations that can also stabilize the distribution.

3. Leverage interactions among features as they may capture complex relationships which single feature transformations might miss.

Thus, the enhanced feature set is:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, 
 f4 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, 
 f0 cube, f1 cube, f2 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f9 cube, 
 f3 square, f9 square, 
 f0 f1 + sqrt, 
 f6 f17 / log, 
 f7 reciprocal f9 * sin, 
 f10 log, 
 f7 minmax_scaler]
```

These transformations are aimed at boosting prediction accuracy by scaling, expanding, and emphasizing complex interactions within the dataset.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:32:05,431 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set inspired by the provided examples, we need to combine existing features using transformations and arithmetic operations. Here's a new feature set that incorporates ideas from both given examples, aiming for a diverse and potentially informative feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 f8 + minmax_scaler ,f9 cos ,f4 sin tanh ,f3 f5 * ,f1 f6 / ,f7 log ,f10 sqrt ,f8 sin ,f2 f4 / f9 + ,f13 f14 + tanh ,f0 f7 - stand_scaler]
```

Here is a breakdown of the new features and transformations:

1. **`f5 f8 + minmax_scaler`**: Combines `f5` and `f8`, scales it using Min-Max scaling.
2. **`f9 cos`**: Applies the cosine transformation to `f9`.
3. **`f4 sin tanh`**: Applies sine and then hyperbolic tangent transformations to `f4`.
4. **`f3 f5 *`**: Multiplies `f3` and `f5`.
5. **`f1 f6 /`**: Divides `f1` by `f6`.
6. **`f7 log`**: Applies the logarithmic transformation to `f7`.
7. **`f10 sqrt`**: Takes the square root of `f10`.
8. **`f8 sin`**: Applies the sine transformation to `f8`.
9. **`f2 f4 / f9 +`**: Divides `f2` by `f4` and adds `f9`.
10. **`f13 f14 + tanh`**: Sums `f13` and `f14` and applies hyperbolic tangent.
11. **`f0 f7 - stand_scaler`**: Computes the difference between `f0` and `f7` and standardizes it.

This feature set is diverse and employs a range of arithmetic operations and transformations, which should capture various patterns and interactions in the data, potentially improving the predictive performance of a downstream model.

Given your two feature set examples, we can combine their best aspects while also adding potentially informative transformations.

Here's a better feature set that incorporates some additional transformations:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation of Transformations:
- **`f0, f1, ..., f20`**: Include all original features to maintain the complete information.
- **`f4 quan_trans stand_scaler`**: Combination of quantile transformation followed by standard scaling on feature `f4`.
- **`f1 f4 +`**: Sum of features `f1` and `f4`.
- **`f0 f6 *`**: Multiplication of features `f0` and `f6`.
- **`f7 f9 +`**: Sum of features `f7` and `f9`.
- **`f13 f12 - sqrt`**: Square root of the difference between features `f13` and `f12`.
- **`f3 f5 *, sqrt`**: Square root of the multiplication of features `f3` and `f5`.
- **`f8 log`**: Logarithm of feature `f8`.
- **`f10 tanh`**: Hyperbolic tangent of feature `f10`.
- **`f2 f17 /`**: Division of feature `f2` by feature `f17`.

These transformations should provide a richer set of features by capturing non-linear relationships, interactions, and scaled variations of the original metrics.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This transformation takes inspiration from both previous examples, leveraging combinations of natural logarithms, square roots, and normalization to potentially reveal complex relationships in the data that were not initially obvious. The choice of operations aims to provide a better-scaled feature for the target prediction task.

Changes made:
- Introduced `minmax_scaler` transformation for `f8`.
- Added `f2 f19 -` and `f3 f19 -` for more differential insights.
- Moved existing transformations to maintain non-linearity and variability across features.
- Introduced `f8 sin` for potentially capturing periodic relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This set includes a transformation that utilizes a logarithmic function on `f9`, which can help in stabilizing variance and normalizing the distribution of the feature. The term `f0 f19 / tanh` calculates the hyperbolic tangent of the ratio of `f0` and `f19`, which could capture relative changes or interactions between these features, potentially highlighting non-linear relationships. Together, these transformations may provide better representations for the downstream task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:32:44,747 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples and transformations, the goal is to introduce transformations that can capture non-linear relationships, normalize the data, and potentially derive more meaningful features from combinations of the existing ones. Here's a feature set that improves upon the previous ones:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

f15 f9 - f10 + minmax_scaler, f16 f7 * stand_scaler, 
f6 f17 - f18 * log, f5 f16 square]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Non-linear transformations**: Operations like `sqrt`, `log`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cube` are used to capture potential non-linear relationships in the data.

2. **Interactions between features**: We included interaction terms (e.g., `f5 f16 *`, `f6 f17 /`, `f3 f4 *`, etc.) to explore interactions between different features.

3. **Normalization/Scaling**: Using transformations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` helps in normalizing the feature space, which can be beneficial for models sensitive to feature scales.

4. **Derived Features from Combinations**: Features are combined in different ways (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) to explore complex relationships.

These transformations provide a mix of non-linear transformations, scaling, and feature interactions aimed at capturing a wide range of patterns in your data.

2025-09-28 23:32:49,979 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, both aim to create additional features through transformations such as scaling, arithmetic operations, and activation functions like cosine and hyperbolic tangent. To improve the predictive capability of these features, I'll propose a new, improved feature set that combines insightful transformations and retains potentially informative operations. The intention is to balance feature diversity and potential utility for prediction tasks.

New Feature Set:
```plaintext
[f5 ,f8 ,f11 ,f4 f5 - minmax_scaler ,f7 tanh ,f0 cube ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f9 cos ,f0 f6 - ,f1 f4 minmax_scaler - stand_scaler ,f4 f11 - ,f6 f4 minmax_scaler - ,f10 f1 - ,f8 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler stand_scaler ,f19 cos stand_scaler ,f1 f4 - stand_scaler ,f5 f4 - ,f0 f8 * sqrt ,f1 f2 * sqrt ,f3 f9 * sqrt ,f6 f17 / log ,f13 f7 - tanh ,f5 f19 - ,f0 f6 - tanh]
```

Explanation:

1. **Diverse Scaling and Normalization**: Combination of min-max scaling and standard scaling across features improves feature distribution, helping models learn more effectively.
   
2. **Transformation Awareness**: Employing transformations such as cubic (cube) can capture non-linearity and complex interactions between features.

3. **Meaningful Arithmetic Operations**: Subtractions between related features (such as `f1 f4 -`) highlight potential influences or redundancies between them, and are scaled to manage variance.

4. **Activation Functions**: Hyperbolic tangent and cosine operations are used selectively to capture non-linear relationships that might otherwise be missed.

5. **Root and Logarithmic Operations**: Features like `f0 f8 * sqrt` and `f6 f17 / log` are retained to manage feature scales and magnitudes, which might correlate with the defect prediction target.

This improved feature set reflects a balanced approach of using transformations to extract potentially useful patterns and optimizing the feature space for better model performance on software defect prediction.

Here's the new feature set:

```

### Explanation:

1. **Transforms and Non-linear Patterns:**
   - Used operations like `sqrt`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` to model non-linear relationships.
   - Applied scaling transformations like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans` to normalize and standardize features.
   - Used `reciprocal` and `cube` for additional non-linear interactions and to capture variance in features with inverse and polynomial relationships.

2. **Combining Features:**
   - Combined features that might have potential interactions, such as `f0 f8 * sqrt` and `f20 f15 / tanh`, to capture multiplicative relationships.
   - Included differences (`f0 f15 -`) and ratios (`f6 f7 /`) to capture proportional relationships.

3. **Redundant Features Reduction:**
   - Avoided features that were redundant or likely less significant in the previous lists while retaining key operations that seemed significant.

The goal is to transform raw features into representations that could better highlight predictive characteristics for software defect prediction, considering interactions, non-linear transformations, and normalization techniques.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:33:08,855 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two given examples, I'll incorporate transformations that might capture important interactions or nonlinearities in the data, aiming to reveal more meaningful patterns for defect prediction. Here's a proposed set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f10 f8 * tanh, f9 log, f6 f7 * reciprocal, f5 f6 f9 * tanh, f19 f20 sqrt + stand_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
- **f10 f8 * tanh**: This feature is from the second set, aiming to model complex interactions between operators' and operands' effects.
- **f9 log**: Utilizing logarithmic transformation to handle skewness or highlight proportional differences, as seen in the first set.
- **f6 f7 * reciprocal**: Combining Halstead's 'program length' with 'difficulty' through multiplication followed by a reciprocal may capture the balance of complexity and comprehension.
- **f5 f6 f9 * tanh**: This combines 'volume', 'program length', and 'effort' in a way that might capture associated non-linear effects.
- **f19 f20 sqrt + stand_scaler**: This represents an interaction between 'total operands' and 'branch count', passed through a square root transformation to reduce skewness, and followed by standard scaling to normalize the composite feature.

These transformations aim to enhance feature representation while leveraging interactions between different software metrics related to defects.

```

In this feature set:
- I included features from both examples to retain the original features and derived ones.
- Applied transformations such as `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `square`, and `log` to enhance feature scaling and variance.
- Used operations like `tanh` and `sigmoid` for non-linear feature interactions.
- Added `sin` and `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler` for normalizing features as these transformations can help in handling skewness and improving model convergence.
- Integrated existing combinations and enhanced them by including additional operations for potential feature interactions which might uncover hidden patterns associated with the predictive task.

The goal of these transformations and combinations is to enhance model performance by providing meaningful and scaled inputs to downstream tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-28 23:33:20,602 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set by combining ideas from both examples, we can focus on incorporating effective transformations and combinations of features. Here's a new feature set:

```plaintext

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Baseline Features:** Include all original features (`f0` to `f20`) to maintain raw information.

2. **Transformations:**
   - **Min-Max Scaler** on the difference of `f4` and `f5`, which might help normalize the data and capture variations between these two features.
   - **Tanh** applied to `f7` as it offers a smooth transformation that can highlight distinctions.
   - **Cube transformations** for features (`f0` to `f5`), expanding the non-linear feature space.
   
3. **Combinations:**
   - Combine `f6` and `f16` with a summation to possibly detect synergies or cumulative effects.
   - A complex combination feature using `f9 reciprocal f7 * sin` which might capture unique interactions between these features.
   - **Square Root** applied to `f8`, which can handle distributions with high skewness.
   - **Logarithm** of `f6` divided by `f9` might introduce a scale reduction or even out exponential growth patterns.

This combination aims to harness various transformations and interactions among features, which can potentially lead to better predictive performance in identifying software modules with reported defects.

```

### Explanation:
- **Original Features**: Most features are retained to provide a strong base.
- **Transformations**:
  - **Division** (`f9 f8 /`, `f18 f9 /`): Combined different features as ratios.
  - **Cube** (`f8 cube`, `f9 cube`): Emphasized certain features by cubing.
  - **Min-Max Scaler** (`f16 minmax_scaler`): Normalized a feature.
  - **Logarithm** (`f0 log`): Applied logarithmic transformation for potential non-linear relationships.
  - **Square Root** (`f1 sqrt`): Reduced size differential, aiding in normalization.
  - **Sigmoid** (`f19 sigmoid`): Transformed to a probabilistic range [0,1].
  - **Hyperbolic Tangent** (`f5 tanh`): Implemented non-linearities.
  - **Multiplication** (`f0 f1 *`): Created an interaction term.
  - **Subtraction** (`f4 f6 -`): Captured differences between features.
  - **Cosine** (`f3 f2 cos`): Added periodic transformation for non-linear insights.
  - **Square Root** (`f7 f0 sqrt`): Non-linearity focusing, with an interaction.
  - **Standard Scalar** (`f10 stand_scaler`): Standardized to mean 0 and variance 1.
  
These transformation choices were inspired by balancing both sets and aiming for a diverse range of mathematical operations to potentially highlight latent intricate patterns within the data.

One way to enhance predictive power is by leveraging combinations that address potential redundancy in feature importances and introducing non-linearity to otherwise linear relationships.

Here's an improved feature set:

This enhanced feature set includes:

- Interactions with `tanh`, `sin`, and `sqrt` that can capture non-linearity in interactions between features like `f4`, `f6`, `f8`, `f10`, and `f19`.
- Using logarithmic, square, and cube transformations to explore power-law and polynomial relationships.
- Division by `sqrt` to normalize or adjust the scale/variance in combinations involving key features like `f1`, `f8`, and `f5`.

These transformations and interactions should contribute to improving the downstream prediction task by diversifying the feature space and emphasizing non-linear patterns that might be associated with defects in the software modules.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 quan_trans square ,f16 square ,f6 tanh ,f6 sigmoid]
 
 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f5 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f6 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f7 square, f8 square, f9 square, f19 square, f5 log, f7 log, f9 log, f11 log, f12 log, f0 f1 tanh +, f3 f4 tanh +, f5 f6 tanh +, f7 f8 tanh +, f9 f10 tanh +, f3 f11 sigmoid +, f14 f15 sigmoid +, f4 f11 minmax_scaler +, f14 f17 minmax_scaler +, f3 f19 sin +, f10 f17 cos +, f10 f11 stand_scaler +, f12 f19 stand_scaler +]

2025-09-28 23:33:47,304 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, we aim to construct a better feature set by selecting meaningful transformations and combinations that could enhance the predictive power while maintaining interpretability. Since the latter feature set seems more comprehensive and varied, we will build upon it, choosing a balance of transformations, interactions, and ensuring the inclusion of base features for context. Here is the new modified feature set:

```python
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f5 sqrt, 
f6 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f5 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f6 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, 
f7 square, f17 square, f19 square, f5 log, f7 log, f12 log, 
f0 f1 tanh +, f3 f4 tanh +, f5 f6 tanh +, f7 f8 tanh +, f9 f10 tanh +, 
f3 f11 sigmoid +, f14 f15 sigmoid +, f4 f11 minmax_scaler +, f14 f17 minmax_scaler +, 
f3 f19 sin +, f10 f17 cos +, f10 f11 stand_scaler +, f12 f19 stand_scaler +, 
f6 f7 * log, f5 f18 / sigmoid, f4 f20 sqrt *]
```

**Explanation:**
- Retained a broad set of base features for variability.
- Selected a mix of transformations such as `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `log`, `square`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler` for their potential to normalize and highlight nonlinear relationships.
- Combined transformations (e.g., `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `minmax_scaler`) to capture interactions between features, broadening the model's ability to learn complex patterns.
- Added multiplicative and divisive interactions to explore interactions (`f6 f7 * log`, `f5 f18 / sigmoid`, `f4 f20 sqrt *`), proposing new insights and dependencies between features.

By incorporating these elements, the feature set is designed to strike a balance between diversity and focus, aiming to deliver enhanced predictive performance.
