```

Explanation:
- `f4 sigmoid`: Simple non-linear transformation of the target feature.
- `f3 f4 + sqrt minmax_scaler f4 *`: Square root of a sum, min-max scaled and combined multiplicatively with f4.
- `f3 f4 + sqrt log minmax_scaler`: Logarithmic transformation after square root on sum, then min-max scaled.
- `f2 f3 + sqrt stand_scaler`: Square root of the sum that is standardized.
- `f4 f3 sqrt /`: Division to scale down the intensity of f4 using the square root of f3.
- `f3 f4 + square f4 +`: Non-linearity introduced by squaring the sum of f3 and f4, then adding f4.
- `f4 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling of the target feature.
- `f3 f4 tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent transformation to handle non-linear relationships.
- `f0 sin`: Non-linear transformation with sine on f0 potentially capturing cyclical patterns.
- `f0 f1 + f4 /`: Linear combination of f0 and f1 scaled by f4.
- `f2 f3 + sqrt minmax_scaler f4 -`: Min-max scaling on a square root transformation, subtracted by f4. 

These transformations attempt to capture the underlying patterns and different scales in the data, potentially improving prediction of the counts for the son's first occupation.

Let's synthesize and optimize these two examples into one better feature set.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f4 f0 f4 - - f4 sigmoid cos - ,f0 f4 - f4 - f4 f0 f4 - - - ,f4 sigmoid f4 sigmoid f4 f4 + * + f4 f3 + f4 sigmoid f4 f4 + * + + f4 sigmoid f4 sigmoid f4 f4 + * + f4 f3 + + * sigmoid cos ,f4 f4 sigmoid - cos ,f2 f4 - stand_scaler ,f4 f0 f4 - - tanh ,f0 f4 - f4 - tanh ,f4 f0 f4 - - f4 sigmoid cos - ,f4 sigmoid cos f4 f0 f4 - - - ,f4 f4 f0 f4 - - - sigmoid cos]
```

Explanation:
- Feature transformations such as `sigmoid`, `cos`, and `tanh` are preserved where they can lead to non-linear mappings and smooth transformations for better feature interactions.
- Kept complex nested operations like `f4 sigmoid cos f4 f0 f4 - - -`, which potentially captures intricate relationships.
- Used combination strategies making use of arithmetic operations to compare differences and ratios which can be meaningful in socio-economic data context.
- Applied feature scaling (`stand_scaler`) smartly on partial expression to normalize the range of possible values and mitigate potential dominance of any single feature in the model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Considering the operations available and the transformation examples provided, we aim to combine different scalers and non-linear transformations to extract more encoded signals and interactions between features.

### Proposed Feature Transformation:
```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f3 f4 sigmoid + f4 stand_scaler * f2 cos f4 tanh + reciprocal +]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sigmoid & Stand Scaler**: Applied on separate features to normalize them while preserving relative distribution.
2. **Cos & Tanh**: Capture non-linearities and subtle relationships between the features `f2` and `f4`.
3. **Reciprocal**: Adds a transformation layer that handles inverse relationships in the data, especially useful if certain features exhibit such properties.
4. **Combination using `+` and `*`**: Engage interactions that might extract composite relationships between different features leveraging the non-linear transformations.

This transformation mixes normalization techniques and non-linear feature interactions that could enhance model performance on the classification task.

2025-10-22 11:04:56,010 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature sets examples provided, the goal in feature engineering is to derive new features that potentially enhance the predictive power for the task at hand. To create a better feature set based on these examples, we can consider transformations that are scale-invariant, capture non-linear relationships, and provide meaningful interactions between existing features.

Here's an improved feature set using the transformations available:

```

Explanation for some of these choice transformations:
- **f0 f3 /**: This creates an interaction term between `fathers_occupation` and `family_structure`, which can capture the effect of these two features together.
- **f0 f1 *:** Interaction between `fathers_occupation` and `sons_occupation`, potentially capturing patterns of occupational inheritance that may not be apparent individually.
- **f2 log**: Log transformation of `race` which could help in accentuating differences between racial categories if the coding is numeric.
- **f4 reciprocal**: This transformation can help to stabilize variances and reduce skewness when dealing with features like `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`. 

By leveraging these types of transformations and interactions, we can potentially capture complex patterns in the data, aiding downstream prediction tasks.

```

Explanation of constructed features:
- `f3 f4 + square minmax_scaler`: Scales the sum of `f3` and `f4`, squared, using Min-Max scaling.
- `f3 f4 + square minmax_scaler sqrt * f4 + sigmoid`: Builds on previous transformation with square root and interaction, adding non-linear transformation via sigmoid.
- `f0 f3 - log`: Computes log transformation of the difference between `f0` and `f3`, potentially emphasizing shifts in family structure impacts. 

This construction aims to retain statistical information while introducing non-linear interactions and transformations.

```

Explanation:

1. `f0, f1, f2, f3, f4`: Keep original features to retain baseline information.
2. `f4 log`: Log transformation can help in managing the skewness of the `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` feature.
3. `f3 stand_scaler tanh`: Standard scaling followed by hyperbolic tangent to manage scale and accommodate nonlinear trends.
4. `f2 f4 * sigmoid`: Takes the interaction between two features and applies a sigmoid to potentially capture saturation effects.
5. `f3 f4 - minmax_scaler log`: Difference of two features stabilized using log scaling, then normalized, potentially reducing skew and variance.
6. `f2 f3 + reciprocal`: Evaluates the inverse effect on interactions which might highlight less-obvious trends or dependencies. 

By combining interactions and various transformations, the newly generated features aim to enrich the pattern extraction process for the classification task.

In this improved feature set:
- Added an interaction term `f3 f4 + * sigmoid` to capture non-linear interactions between `family_structure` and `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` enhanced with a non-linear scaling.
- Changed `f4 sigmoid` to `f4 log` for a different transformation that might help with capturing non-linear properties of `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`, addressing potential skewness in distribution.

These changes aim to enhance the effectiveness of the feature transformations, especially when the ultimate goal is to classify the instances based on an occupation count threshold.

Explanation of feature engineering choices:
- `f3 f4 + sqrt minmax_scaler f4 + sigmoid`: This expression compounds multiple interactions and transformations, including summation, square root, min-max normalization, and sigmoid transformation, potentially capturing non-linear relationships.
- `f4 cos`: Cosine transformation can be useful for periodic data, and sometimes applies an interesting non-linear transformation.
- `f2 tanh`: The hyperbolic tangent function is another non-linear transformation that can help differentiate between values more smoothly.
- Various divisions (`f0 f4 /`, `f1 f4 /`, etc.): Dividing features can often capture proportions that might be significant for modeling, especially in settings where relative differences matter. 

These transformations continue to explore non-linear interactions and mixed operations to maximize extraction of useful patterns from features.

Explanation:
- Keep the fundamental original features: `f0, f1, f2, f3, f4`.
- Maintain the complex combined feature: `f3 f4 + square minmax_scaler f3 f4 + square minmax_scaler * f4 + sigmoid`.
- The `f4 f4 -` feature is removed as it always results in zero, thus not adding value.
- Use diverse activation functions on original and derived features: `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `log`.
- Introduce a new interaction term `f0 f1 *` and apply the `stand_scaler` to standardize it, potentially helpful in capturing interactions between father's and son's occupation.

2025-10-22 11:05:56,771 - INFO - llm output = Given the examples provided, here's a new feature set that aims to build on the transformations used in the latter examples. To improve upon those transformations and potentially enhance predictive performance, I suggest the following transformed feature set:

```

Explanation:
1. **Tanh after Stand Scaler**: This transformation can be particularly effective for normalizing and then squashing the values between -1 and 1, which may better capture non-linear relationships.
2. **Cube Tanh**: Applying a cube transformation followed by tanh can help capture more complex polynomial relationships and still keep outputs bounded.
3. **Reciprocal Sin**: Taking the reciprocal followed by sin can sharpen distinctions in small values, which may be crucial for classifying borderline instances.
4. **Addition and Cos**: Combining features with addition and applying cosine may help capture periodic behaviors more effectively.
5. **Multiplication and Division with Cos/Tanh**: Using multiplication between features and applying trigonometric transformations may enhance capturing interactions between features.

Ensure to test the effectiveness of these features with suitable models, as feature transformations can vary in impact based on the learning algorithm used.

We aim to enhance the predictive capability by exploring nonlinear interactions and scaling.

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f4 log, f4 sqrt log, f3 f4 * log, f4 f3 * log, f4 minmax_scaler]

In this feature set:

1. `f4 log` applies the logarithm transformation to `f4`, which is useful for compressing the range of numerical values.
2. `f4 sqrt log` combines square root and log transformations, potentially highlighting underlying distribution characteristics.
3. `f3 f4 * log` explores the interaction between `f3` and `f4` using multiplication followed by log transformation to capture synergy effects.
4. `f4 f3 * log` repeats the above operation with reversed order to evaluate the impact of multiplication direction on `f3` and `f4`.
5. `f4 minmax_scaler` scales `f4` to a range between 0 and 1, normalizing the values for comparison.

These transformations aim to add depth to the feature space and potentially enhance the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes based on subtle feature interactions and distributions.

Key improvements:
- More non-linear transformations of `f4` are included, such as `log` and `reciprocal`, to capture potential non-linear relationships.
- Used a `stand_scaler` after adding `f4` to each of the first four features and taking a `sqrt`, which can help in emphasizing the relative contribution of `f4`.
- Retained some of the basic trigonometric transformations as they might capture cyclic patterns, but reduced redundancy by using them selectively.

```

Explanation:
- `f2 f3 / sqrt minmax_scaler`: This transformation applies division, square root, and min-max scaling consecutively to better handle scaling and non-linearity.
- `f3 f4 + tanh`: By summing features `f3` and `f4` and then applying the hyperbolic tangent function (`tanh`), we introduce non-linear transformations beneficial for capturing complex relationships.
- Extended inclusion of squared features to capture polynomial relationships and potential interactions.
- Retainment of trigonometric transformations to handle periodicity or cyclical patterns.
