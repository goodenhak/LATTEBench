you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Explanation:**

- Retained many features from the latter feature set as this set tends to be more sophisticated with respect to feature interactions and transformations.
- Applied nonlinear transformations such as `tanh`, `cos`, and `cos square` to capture non-linear relationships.
- Included quantile transformation (`quan_trans`) on various features for better distribution scaling, tackling issues with skewed data distribution.
- Integrated additional feature interactions by introducing feature pairs (+, *, /, - operations) that are likely to capture underlying interactions in the data.
- Introduced new interactions across diverse features, such as between `f12` and `f32`, and between `f35` and `f38`, emphasizing interaction between unique descriptors.
- Continued usage and additional pairings with cosine transformed features to create new interactions and capture potential periodicity.

### Explanation:
- **Inverse Transformations**: Adding `reciprocal` and `sigmoid` for new perspectives and nonlinear dynamics.
- **Logarithmic Feature**: Log transformation on `f22` that captures multiplicative relationships.
- **Complex Transformations**: Use combinations of arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and advanced transformations (e.g., `cos`, `cube`) for potential nonlinear dynamics.
- **Quan Transforms**: Apply on foundational features for normalization and potential upliftment in feature space.
- **Tanh Transforms**: Retain various tanh transformations from second feature set to capture bounded transformations useful for gradient-based learning tasks.

This set should enrich the modeling effort by covering diverse feature transformations with considerations for both linear and nonlinear dynamics inherent in chemical descriptors affecting biodegradability.

Key improvements:
- Mixed use of scaling (standard scaling) and transformations such as `tanh` and `sigmoid` for non-linear pattern capturing.
- Use of certain arithmetic operations to create combined features before applying transformations, enhancing feature interaction possibilities.
- Careful incorporation of `reciprocal` and `sqrt` to handle diverse data distributions.
- A balanced mix of original features and new transformations to ensure diversity in the feature space while maintaining interpretability.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 12:04:35,272 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the two given examples, we'll incorporate some advanced feature transformation steps while building on the previous transformations and adding new ones. Maintaining the same format as the examples provided, here is a new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f2 cube ,f29 cube ,f36 cube ,f37 cube ,f17 cos cube ,f35 cos cube ,f0 sin ,f7 sin ,f14 sin ,f26 sin ,f1 cube ,f13 cube ,f16 cube ,f17 cube ,f35 cube ,f3 cube ,f4 cube ,f5 cube ,f6 cube ,f8 cube ,f9 cube ,f10 cube ,f15 cube ,f18 cube ,f19 cube ,f20 cube ,f22 cube ,f23 cube ,f25 cube ,f28 cube ,f30 cube ,f31 cube ,f32 cube ,f33 cube ,f39 cube ,f40 cube ,f34 cube ,f11 sigmoid ,f12 sigmoid ,f21 sigmoid ,f27 sigmoid ,f38 sigmoid, f29 * f35, f7 log ,f14 log ,f32 + f26 ,f24 - f9 ,f5 / f25 ,f40 reciprocal ]
```

### Explanation of the Additional Features:
- **`f29 * f35`**: Interaction term could capture joint effects of these features.
- **`f7 log`**, **`f14 log`**: Logarithmic transformation to manage skewness in these features.
- **`f32 + f26`**: Linear combination to couple potentially related features.
- **`f24 - f9`**: Linear contrast that might capture differences between these features.
- **`f5 / f25`**: Ratio that could reveal relative importance or scale relationships between these features.
- **`f40 reciprocal`**: Reciprocal transformation might capture inverse relationships.

Implementing these additional transformations enhances the set by introducing new interactions, non-linear transformations, and feature combinations, thus facilitating improved model predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 12:04:47,607 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples and the requirement to generate a better feature set, we should try to capture meaningful interactions and transformations while minimizing redundancy. The goal is to create features that can potentially capture non-linear relationships and interactions that may exist in the data. Here is a refined feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f21, f35, f38, f26 sigmoid, f0 sigmoid log, f26 sigmoid log, f2 f4 -, f6 f8 -, f2 f19 -, f6 f10 -, f4 f10 -, f19 f29 -, f22 f33 -, f2 f6 - f5 f19 - - f22 f37 -]
```

### Explanation of Selections:
1. **Original Features**: Retained `f0`, `f1`, `f21`, `f35`, `f38` as potential direct indicators or aggregations for meaningful descriptors.
   
2. **Sigmoid Transformations**: Retain `f26 sigmoid` and its log variation—strategically chosen sigmoidal transforms can help handle very diverse scales and may enhance the linear separability of features.
   
3. **Feature Interactions**: 
   - Differences such as `f2 f4 -`, `f6 f8 -`, and complementary interactions from the second provided example were retained because they may capture relative differences or some form of non-linear interaction between the features.
   - More complex interactions like `f2 f6 - f5 f19 - -` and `f22 f37 -` were included based on potential insights these could give over redundant pairwise subtractions.

This approach tries to balance between retaining potentially valuable descriptors while introducing calculated transformations to introduce non-linear patterns that might be valuable for the task at hand—classification of chemical biodegradability.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 12:04:59,985 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we need to consider both postprocessing techniques and operations to enrich feature representation. The aim is to achieve a comprehensive yet compact feature set that might improve predictions by capturing non-linear relationships and interactions. Here's an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f24, f26, f27, f29, f30, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40,
 f0 stand_scaler reciprocal, f0 f39 - reciprocal, f26 f9 - reciprocal,
 f2 sigmoid f0 stand_scaler - reciprocal, f2 sigmoid f0 f25 - - reciprocal,
 f11 stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f21 stand_scaler, f27 stand_scaler, f38 stand_scaler,
 f3 reciprocal, f4 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f15 reciprocal, f22 reciprocal, f23 reciprocal, f25 reciprocal, f28 reciprocal, f29 reciprocal, f30 reciprocal, f40 reciprocal,
 f34 square, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f15 tanh, f18 tanh, f19 tanh, f20 tanh, f22 tanh, f23 tanh, f25 tanh, f28 tanh, f29 tanh, f30 tanh, f31 tanh, f32 tanh, f33 tanh, f37 tanh, f39 tanh, f40 tanh,
 f2 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f14 sqrt, f28 sqrt, f32 sqrt,
 f12 f21 - sqrt reciprocal, f17 f19 - sqrt reciprocal,
 f26 f9 - reciprocal sin, f26 f20 - reciprocal cos, f26 f22 - reciprocal tanh,
 f3 square, f4 square, f5 square, f15 square, f22 square, f23 square,
 f0 f10 cube + sqrt, f12 f17 cube - sqrt]
```

Here are the improvements:

- **Reciprocal, Stand Scaler, and Sigmoid**: Continue using reciprocal transformations for balancing data. Sigmoid is applied to capture non-linear scaling.
- **Square and Cube**: These operations create polynomial features, useful for capturing interactions.
- **Sqrt**: Applied several times can capture more intricate continuous relationships.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: By using sin, cos, and tanh, we attempt to harness periodic or s-shaped relationships.
- **Combination Operations**: Added combinations such as `cube + sqrt` to explore complex inter-feature relationships.

This feature set aims to enrich the representation by adding non-linear transformations, polynomial expansions, and scaling techniques, which are essential in machine learning tasks that involve chemical properties.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 12:05:06,334 - INFO - llm output = To derive a better feature set based on the two examples provided, we can incorporate additional transformations and interactions that might capture different aspects of the data. One strategy is to explore diverse feature transformations or interactions that are unexplored in the examples, aiming for potentially informative features. Here’s a proposed improved feature set:

f3 * f31 ,f15 / f8 ,f22 log ]
```

This feature set combines transformations such as `sqrt`, `square`, `tanh`, and scaling methods (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) on various original features, adds reciprocal interactions that might reveal nonlinear relationships, and builds upon existing transformations by incorporating new interaction terms (like `f3 * f31` and `f4 * f18`) to introduce additional complexity and dimensionality to the feature space. These adjustments can increase predictive capability by capturing different underlying patterns in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:
1. **Trigonometric Transformations**: Utilizing `sin` and `cos` functions capture periodic patterns or oscillations in the data representation.
2. **Quantile Transformation**: Helps in normalizing feature distributions to mitigate the effect of outliers and skewed data.
3. **Cubing and Cube Transformation**: Captures cubic relationships and interactions that linear models might miss.
4. **Combinations of Features with Operations**: Applying binary operations like subtraction or division, as well as multiplication with other features, allows identifying interactions between variables.
5. **Composite Transformations**: Applying subsequent transformations such as `sin square`, `tanh`, `quan_trans sqrt` allow capturing more complex patterns and interactions.
6. **Feature Scaling**: Use `minmax_scaler` to ensure uniform scaling of features, aiding in model convergence and performance.

This feature set is designed to capture linear, cubic, periodic, and interaction-based complexities in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set:
- Keep adding interactions and transformations that are non-linear such as cube, sin, and sqrt.
- Integrate scaling techniques like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` alongside `tanh` and `quan_trans` to normalize, standardize, and manipulate data distributions.
- Include features derived from `sin` and `cos` for periodic or circular variation capture which might be especially useful in complex chemical datasets.
- Implement strategic subtraction operations to extract relative differences across important molecular descriptor pairs.
- Mix original feature values and transformed ones to preserve robust combinations suitable for predictive modeling.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, additional transformations like multiplication between selected features, trigonometric functions like `tanh` and `cos`, and transformations with `reciprocal` are used to potentially capture non-linear relationships and interactions more effectively. These additions are expected to enhance the model's ability to predict the given classes.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 12:06:17,120 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, I'll focus on using a combination of transformations that can enhance the existing features while potentially extracting more meaningful patterns relevant to the classification task. The second example introduced the usage of sigmoid transformation and more complex combinations of features. Thus, I'll incorporate these transformations and extend the feature interactions to potentially uncover hidden relationships between the attributes.

Here's a suggested better feature set:

```

Enhancements and considerations in the new set:
1. **Complex Interactions:** The combination of operations like division, cosine, and multiplication should help in capturing complex patterns.
2. **Sigmoid Transformation:** Applied to some features and interactions to normalize values and focus on confidence levels in classification.
3. **New Transforms:** Introduced hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`), logarithm (`log`), square root (`sqrt`), and cubing (`cube`) to provide nonlinear transformations that can help expose complex dependencies between features.
4. **Expanded Feature Interactions:** Increased combinations especially with transformations for potential hidden relationships.

These enhancements aim to provide more flexibility and introduce non-linear transformations to potentially improve the model's predictive power.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here’s a proposed improved feature set based on the two provided examples:

```

**Changes and Additions:**
1. **Reciprocal Transformation**: To bring non-linear insights, I included a reciprocal transformation on `f2`.
2. **Square Root Transformation**: Applied to `f22 f2 -` to soften the influence of the subtraction result.
3. **Multiplication Interaction**: Created an interaction term between `f22` and `f19`, which might enhance complexity capture.
4. **Min-Max and Standard Scaling**: Applied min-max scaling on `f10 f6 - cube` and standard scaling on `f10 f40 - square` to normalize data ranges and manage distribution effects.
5. **Tanh and Sqrt**: Using hyperbolic tangent function on `f2 f4 - cube` for non-linear squashing of values and square root to ease heavy influence of square-related transformations.
6. **Division Interaction**: Included a `f21 sin /` division to introduce variability due to division properties.

These adjustments aim to refine the feature set by introducing a new layer of nonlinear transformations to capture hidden patterns and interactions while ensuring the features are scaled appropriately for better model performance.

This feature set maintains all initial necessary features, utilizes effective transformations like `sigmoid` and `sqrt` on key features. It applies `quan_trans` to various features for normalization and includes transformations that might help capture non-linear relationships in the data. Features like `f0 f1 * sigmoid` explore interactions between base features, and usage of `sin` and `sqrt` might introduce non-linear dynamics that aid in classification.

[f0 ,f35 ,f2 f6 - ,f2 f10 - ,f6 f29 - ,f15 f33 - ,f33 f37 - ,f40 f2 - ,f40 f5 - ,f40 f9 - ,f40 f15 - ,f0 f22 - f2 f4 - + ,f0 f22 - f2 f33 - + ,f0 f22 - f8 f19 - + ,f0 f15 - f22 f40 - + ,f0 f22 - f6 f40 - + ,f5 f6 - f2 f10 - + ,f6 f10 - f2 f4 - + ,f6 f19 - f2 f33 - + ,f6 f23 - f2 f4 - + ,f6 f23 - f6 f9 - + ,f6 f40 - f2 f4 - + ,f6 f40 - f2 f33 - + ,f6 f40 - f7 f8 - + ,f10 f29 - f2 f6 - + ,f10 f33 - f2 f6 - + ,f0 sin ,f0 cube ,f35 sin ,f0 f5 sigmoid + ,f6 f22 sigmoid + ]
```

This feature set takes into account a diverse range of operations such as `+`, `-`, and non-linear transformations like `sin`, `cube`, and `sigmoid`. These transformations and combinations of features are intended to potentially capture more complex relationships within the data, which may contribute to a more accurate model for predicting the biodegradability classification.

In this new feature set, I've included a mix of basic arithmetical operations, trigonometric transformations (cosine and sine), quantile transformations, scaling/divide operations, as well as new transformations like square root, cube, and others to create rich and diverse features. This should provide broader feature exploration possibilities to enhance the prediction models.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2025-09-30 12:07:13,630 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, it is important to retain various operations and transformations that might enhance model performance. The latter set adds more feature transformations and manipulations, which suggests that it might capture more complex relationships. Given this information, I will craft a feature set that combines the strengths of both while making sure not to lose the key transformations or exceed complexity unnecessarily.

Here is a proposed improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f21 ,f35 ,f21 sin ,f0 cube ,f26 cube ,f2 f4 - ,f2 f5 - ,f2 f10 - ,f2 f19 - ,f2 f22 - ,f2 f29 - ,f2 f30 - ,f2 f33 - ,f2 f37 - ,f4 f2 - ,f4 f5 - ,f4 f22 - ,f4 f29 - ,f4 f40 - ,f5 f4 - ,f5 f10 - ,f5 f22 - ,f5 f32 - ,f5 f33 - ,f5 f40 - ,f6 f5 - ,f6 f8 - ,f6 f29 - ,f6 f30 - ,f10 f2 - ,f10 f6 - ,f10 f40 - ,f15 f32 - ,f22 f2 - ,f22 f40 - ,f29 f4 - ,f29 f6 - ,f29 f33 - ,f30 f33 - ,f33 f2 - ,f33 f30 - ,f33 f40 - ,f37 f2 - ,f37 f6 - ,f37 f29 - ,f40 f4 - ,f40 f5 - ,f40 f6 - ,f40 f8 - ,f40 f9 - ,f40 f10 - ,f40 f22 - ,f40 f29 - ,f40 f32 - ,f40 f33 - ,f35 cube ,f21 sin cube ,f0 cube cube ,f26 cube cube ,f2 f4 - cube ,f2 f8 - cube ,f2 f10 - cube ,f2 f32 - cube ,f4 f2 - cube ,f4 f5 - cube ,f4 f22 - cube ,f4 f40 - cube ,f5 f22 - cube ,f6 f8 - cube ,f6 f29 - cube ,f6 f30 - cube ,f10 f6 - cube ,f10 f40 - cube ,f10 f6 - cos ,f5 f32 - quan_trans ,f2 f32 - square ,f4 f2 - square ,f4 f5 - square ,f10 f40 - square ,f0 sin ,f2 f5 - sin ,f2 f37 - sin ,f6 f5 - sin ,f6 f29 - sin]
```

This set includes a selection of basic features along with multiple nonlinear transformations (e.g., `cube`, `sin`, `cos`, `square`, `quan_trans`) applied to combinations and differences of these features, providing the possibility of capturing more complex patterns in the data. The inclusion of more feature combinations and transformations compared to the original sets should enhance predictive performance.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```
Rationale:
1. Selected individual transformations (like sine and cube) are used effectively to explore potential non-linearities in features such as f0, f14, f21, and f38.
2. Combination transformations like `f21 sin`, `f35 cube`, and `f38 cube` are preserved to maintain useful variance in data capture.
3. Composite combinations integrating multiple mathematical operations (like division and addition combined with sinusoidal transformations) introduce diversity in feature relationships.
4. The incorporation of functions like min-max scaling and quantile transformation is avoided here in favor of maintaining mathematical interpretations, focusing more on complex interactions and transformations to manipulate feature phenomenology directly.
5. The organization and selection aim to balance complexity with the interpretability and potential value of interactions to prepare the dataset for improved downstream learning tasks.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Enhancements made:
- Added basic transformations (e.g., log, reciprocal) that can help linearize data or normalize scales.
- Introduced a combination of operations as new synthetic features (e.g., `f2 f4 f6 * +` as a product plus sum feature).
- Considered an additional division transformation to capture relative changes (`f40 f6 /`).
- Kept sin transformations for potentially capturing periodicity or non-linear relationships.

These enhancements aim to capture more complex relationships and variations within the dataset, potentially leading to improved predictions for the classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Key additions and improvements:
- Retained all existing transformed features from both given examples for comprehensiveness.
- Added `f21 sin tanh` to introduce a non-linear activation transformation of a trigonometric feature.
- Kept useful transformations such as `square` and `cube` for potentially non-linear relationships.
- Retained `quan_trans` and added `cos` transformations to provide statistical and trigonometric transformations for diverse feature interactions.

This improved feature set combines statistical, trigonometric, and non-linear transformations, which can capture complex relationships within the data that may improve the predictive model's accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This new feature set incorporates a variety of mathematical transformations and combinations that might capture nonlinear relationships and interactions that are potentially important for predicting the biodegradability of chemicals. It includes previous features and additional logarithmic transformations, as well as combinations using sine, cosine, squares, and cubes that are applied strategically to certain features. Additionally, a standard scaling transformation is included in some feature pairs to normalize them, which can be effective for model training.

2025-09-30 12:08:42,267 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided and the goal of providing a better feature set for improving predictions, we need to consider an approach that leverages the diversity of mathematical transformations while avoiding redundancy, which can help in improving the model's ability to learn complex relationships in the data. We'll incorporate transformations such as cube, sine, and scaling operations, which potentially capture non-linear relationships, while also maintaining the focus on quantile transformations which are useful in managing outlier impacts. Here is the proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f21 ,f35 ,f26 cube ,f0 cube ,f21 sin ,f4 f2 - ,f2 f30 - ,f2 f33 - ,f2 f37 - ,f4 f2 - ,f4 f40 - ,f5 f10 - ,f5 f32 - ,f6 f5 - ,f6 f8 - ,f10 f6 - ,f10 f40 - ,f33 f2 - ,f33 f30 - ,f33 f40 - ,

```

In this feature set suggestion:
- I've maintained diversity in operations while ensuring some transformations address potential non-linear relationships.
- Quantile transformations (quan_trans) are included to handle non-normal distributions and outliers effectively.
- Key computations (e.g., differences between features, powered transformations) are retained to capture data complexity.

This selection retains the beneficial transformations from both sets and extends them with additional non-linear transformations and combined operations. It also eliminates redundant operations while keeping the diverse transformations that could help capture underlying patterns in the data effectively.

The goal is to explore deeper transformations and more combinations, while remaining within the realm of useful and computationally feasible feature engineering.

Here is the improved feature set:

```

In this feature set:
- We've introduced additional mathematical transformations like `square`, `sqrt`, `sphere` (as an example transformation).
- We've included more interactions between different features to potentially capture complex multi-feature relationships.
- Enhanced diversity by applying both linear and non-linear transformations to higher-order interactions.
- Retained some of the transformations from the preceding feature sets as they aren't necessarily insufficient but enriched them with additional options.

2025-09-30 12:09:03,981 - INFO - llm output = Considering the two feature sets provided, which build upon an extensive use of transformations and combinations, the aim is to derive a new feature set that is compact, improves the characterization of the data, and enhances the downstream task performance. To achieve this, we'll streamline the use of operations and focus on efficient feature combinations, especially utilizing nonlinear transformations like trigonometric and logistic functions, given their ability to capture complex relationships:

- Begin with foundational features: f0, f21, f35 to maintain key information components.
- Utilize non-linear transformations on critical base features: sin, cube, and sigmoid for complexity.
- Apply additive and subtractive operations to derive meaningful interactions between features.
- Prioritize combinations that emphasize diverse parts of the data (like using subtraction followed by non-linear operations).

Here is the proposed refined feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f21 sin, f35 cube, f0 sigmoid, f2 f4 - f5 f6 - +, f2 f10 - cosine, f2 f33 - tanh, f8 f29 - f10 f32 - sin +, f8 f37 - cube, f29 f4 - f6 f19 - +, f29 f10 - f35 +, f22 f40 - sigmoid, f40 f33 - reciprocal, f40 f6 - reciprocal, f5 f2 - log, f5 f3 - quan_trans, f10 f6 - f21 sin +, f6 f40 - f35 f0 +, f8 f29 - f6 f23 - +, f0 f2 - f6 f15 - +, f8 f40 - square, f6 f2 - stand_scaler, f5 f2 - f2 f29 - - cosine, f5 f6 - f32 f4 - + tanh, f6 f15 - f2 f27 - + tanh]
```

### Explanation:
- This set retains diverse features with focused transformations such as non-linear functions (`sin`, `cosine`, `tanh`, `cube`) and logistic-like transformations (`sigmoid`).
- Incorporates feature differences and combinations ensuring interactions representative of underlying data dynamics.
- Emphasizes operations that capture non-linear relationships for better prediction performance in classification tasks.

The refined feature set aims to capture the complexity and nuances in the dataset, driving improved performance in classification scenarios.

**Explanation:**
- We retain simple arithmetic differences and utilize operations like `sigmoid`, `sin`, and `cos` on certain combinations to emphasize non-linearity and capture complex relationships.
- We introduce some mathematical transformations combining the use of basic operations and illustrate combinations with exponents through `sqrt` and mathematical operators.
- The aim is to achieve a balance of synthetic features that are simple derivatives of others in ways that could maximize the diversity and representation capabilities of our new feature vector, potentially adding feature mask combinations that could inspire more intricate learning modeling.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The latter example is improved by adding more diversity with the use of `sin` transformations on existing features. To further enhance it, we'll consider including additional operations, ensuring a combination that captures potential complex relationships. Here is an improved feature set:

In this improved feature set:
- Retaining key transformations from both initial sets that could capture non-linear relationships.
- Introducing a new feature using multiplication (`f0 f1 *`) to explore interaction effects between two features.
- Implementing a square root transformation on an interaction term (`f33 f32 * sqrt`) to provide a different perspective on these combined features, possibly normalizing their effect.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

In this feature set, I've combined transformations found in both earlier examples while introducing potentially beneficial new transformations such as `sqrt`, `minmax_scaler`, and `sigmoid` for non-linear transformations which can capture different aspects of the data. The inclusion of `quan_trans`, `square`, `sin`, `cube`, transformations ensures the representation of non-linear relationships and potential normalization of features to enhance model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This set combines basic transformations, interactions, and scaling techniques (like `quan_trans` and `minmax_scaler`) to capture non-linear relationships and scale features into suitable ranges, hopefully boosting the prediction capability of a machine learning model. To further enhance it, you could explore additional complex transformations as part of a hyperparameter tuning process, depending on the results it's yielding in model evaluations.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2025-09-30 12:09:43,433 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two new feature sets you've provided, the goal is to select and suggest a better feature set by comparing them and incorporating variations that could potentially improve predictive performance. Here’s a feature set that integrates the new operations introduced in the second list:

```

In this optimized feature set, I retained the existing transformations and added variety by introducing the following adjustments:
- Kept the newer operations introduced, like `quan_trans`, `square`, and `cos`.
- Added two more operations: `sqrt` and `log`, using them in plausible contexts that could aid in capturing different scales and distributions in the data.

The chosen transformations aim to provide a richer feature space with varying scales and non-linear transformations, which might enhance the performance of downstream models.
