The transformations used here include mathematical, trigonometric, and standard scaling transformations which are typically useful in feature engineering to bring non-linearity and scale invariance into models, especially for medical data like heart disease prediction.

Here's a combined and potentially improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

In this feature set, I've retained diverse transformations including sigmoid, tanh, and min-max scaling to help manage feature ranges and handle any potential non-linear relationships. Also, mathematical operations like square, cube, and assorted feature interactions (combinations via addition or multiplication) have been included to enhance the dataset with possibly meaningful interactions. This set leverages rich and varied transformations that may capture complex relationships in the input data conducive for predicting the presence of heart disease.

When transitioning from the first to the second example given, it's evident that the latter is simpler, focusing on the transformation of individual features using square root rather than complex combinations. I'll build on this by applying meaningful transformations where appropriate and avoiding excessive complexity, as feature simplicity can often aid model interpretability and efficiency.

In this new feature set:
- I've retained the original features for baseline use.
- I've selected specific features for simple transformations like `sqrt` to capture non-linear relationships.
- I've applied `sigmoid` to `f10` as it might help in squashing extreme values, which could be useful for features representing probabilities or ratios.
- I included `stand_scaler` for `f0` to standardize it, which may be beneficial for models sensitive to feature scale.
- I've limited redundant complex transformations, maintaining a balance between exploration of transformations and feature simplicity.

- Applied transformations like `sqrt`, `square`, and `square sqrt` to capture non-linear relationships.
- Used differences (like `f2 f3 -`) to capture risk factor differences, potentially indicating abnormalities.
- Applied transformations like `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `stand_scaler` to some features to normalize or capture nonlinear trends.

2025-10-22 10:05:20,476 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set by analyzing the two given feature sets, we can consider the following approach:

1. Identify features or transformations common in both examples that might indicate their importance.
2. Include a mix of transformations that capture both linear and non-linear relationships.
3. Prefer transformations that are empirically more meaningful or complex from the latter example, which is suggested to be better.

Given the two sets, let’s create a more effective feature set considering these points:

```
[f1 f8 + , f2 f11 + , f8 f9 + , f9 f1 + , f10 f1 + , f8 f1 + square , f8 f9 + square , f1 f10 + cos , f8 f9 + cos , f8 f12 + cos , f10 cos cube , f8 f9 + cube , f10 f1 + cube , f10 cos sigmoid , f8 f9 + sigmoid , f10 f1 + sigmoid , f1 f10 + cos reciprocal , f1 f8 + minmax_scaler , f1 f10 + minmax_scaler , f9 f1 + minmax_scaler , f10 f12 + minmax_scaler , f1 f10 + square minmax_scaler , f8 f1 + square minmax_scaler , f1 f10 + cos minmax_scaler , f9 cos sigmoid , f8 f9 + square reciprocal]
```

Explanation:
- Retained most transformations from the latter, which is suggested to be superior.
- Included linear combinations, quadratic features, and non-linear transformations.
- Kept transformations involving `minmax_scaler`, `cos`, and `sigmoid`, suggested to balance between linear and non-linear manipulations.
- Focused on combinations and transformations that appear in both feature sets and are more comprehensive.

2025-10-22 10:05:27,273 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations and the task at hand, which involves predicting the presence of heart disease, here is a synthesized and possibly improved feature set. This set takes into account the use of diverse transformations to potentially capture different aspects of the data distribution and interactions between features:

```plaintext
[f1 f8 + ,f2 f11 + ,f8 f9 + ,f9 f1 + ,f10 f1 + ,f8 f1 + square ,f8 f9 + square ,f8 f12 + cos ,f9 f1 + cos ,f10 cos reciprocal ,f8 f9 + cube ,f10 f1 + cube ,f9 cos sigmoid ,f10 cos sigmoid ,f8 f9 + sigmoid ,f10 f1 + sigmoid ,f10 cos cube sin ,f1 f10 + cos reciprocal ,f8 f9 + square reciprocal ,f8 f1 + square minmax_scaler ,f8 f9 + cos minmax_scaler ,f1 f10 + square minmax_scaler ,f10 f12 + minmax_scaler ,f1 f10 + cos minmax_scaler ,f8 f12 + cos square minmax_scaler ,f1 f8 + square square ,f1 f10 + minmax_scaler square ,f2 f11 + square ,f9 f1 + cos square]
```

Key considerations for this feature set include:

1. **Combination and Interaction**: Several features are combined using addition to capture interactions, such as `[f1 f8 +]` and `[f8 f9 +]`. These combinations might capture latent patterns that individual features do not.

2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Functions such as `square`, `cube`, and `cos` introduce non-linearity, which may help in capturing complex relationships. For instance, `[f10 cos cube]` and `[f8 f12 + cos]`.

3. **Scaling and Normalization**: `minmax_scaler` is used to bring features to a common scale, potentially improving the performance of algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude differences.

4. **Use of Derived Features**: Features derived from combinations and transformations of original features, such as `[f10 f1 + square minmax_scaler]`, create new dimensions which might be critical for the predictive model.

5. **Inclusion of Reciprocal and Sigmoid**: These transformations, such as `[f10 cos reciprocal]` and `[f9 cos sigmoid]`, can help handle skewed distributions or map features to a bounded scale, potentially stabilizing the model training process.

By integrating a broad spectrum of transformations and combinations, the synthesized feature set aims to enhance the model's ability to capture underlying patterns related to heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2025-10-22 10:05:39,895 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples and the goal of improving feature engineering for better predictive performance, we can propose a new set of features using more advanced transformations. These transformations can help in capturing non-linear relationships and normalizing the features. Let's extend and refine the feature set:

```
[f2, f8, f9, f10, f2 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f1 f7 *, f2 f3 *, f2 f7 *, f5 f7 *, f8 f3 *, f8 f7 *, f9 f3 *, f9 f7 *, f10 f3 *, f10 f7 *, f2 sqrt sqrt, f8 sqrt sqrt, f9 sqrt sqrt, f1 f7 * sqrt, f4 sqrt sqrt, f7 sqrt sqrt, f2 f3 * sqrt, f2 f7 * sqrt, f10 sqrt, f2 log, f8 log, f9 log, f10 log, f3 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 tanh, f2 f7 /, f3 f9 /, f2 f10 /, f3 f8 /, f10 f8 -, f1 f9 -, f2 f7 -]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Logarithmic Transformations (`log`)**: Applying logarithm to features can help with normalization and dealing with skewed data.
2. **Reciprocal Transformations (`reciprocal`)**: Useful in dealing with varying scales and magnifying relationships when the values are small.
3. **Hyperbolic Tangent (`tanh`)**: Helps in capturing non-linear relationships and squashing the values between -1 and 1, which can be useful for features like `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved).
4. **Division Operations (`/`)**: Capture interaction effects and help identify relative contributions between pairs of features.
5. **Subtraction Operations (`-`)**: Highlight differences between feature pairs, useful for contrasting factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which might have a combined effect on heart disease risk.

By using these transformations and interactions, we aim to better capture the underlying patterns that might help in predicting the presence of heart disease more accurately.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Rationale for additions:**

1. **`f0 f8 minmax_scaler`:** Introducing a min-max scaling transformation between features f0 and f8 to bring them into a comparable scale, which can be especially useful when combining or comparing features in models.

2. **`f2 quan_trans`:** Applying quantile transformation to feature f2, making it more robust to outliers and capturing non-linear relationships.

3. **Enhancements in existing interactions:** Retaining complex interactions and transformations to capture potential non-linear relationships important for heart disease prediction.

These transformations aim to improve feature representation by ensuring comparability and handling potential non-linear relationships and outliers better.

2025-10-22 10:06:30,490 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, we aim to create a new feature set that is likely to improve predictions. I'll combine elements from both sets and introduce potential improvements:

- Removing duplicate or redundant features, especially when they involve similar operations on the same inputs.
- Combining impactful transformations and interactions to enhance feature utility.

Here's the optimized feature set:

```plaintext
[f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f0 f2 *, f0 f10 *, f1 f9 *, f8 f2 *, f9 f8 *, f10 f0 *, f10 f1 *, f1 f9 * sqrt, f0 f10 * sqrt, f2 f0 * sqrt, f5 f8 * sqrt, f8 f2 * sqrt, f2 f2 * sqrt, f8 f6 * sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt, f1 f10 * sqrt, f10 f5 * sqrt, f10 f10 * sqrt, f2 sqrt, f0 f2 * sqrt, f10 f1 * sqrt, f10 f0 * sqrt, f1 f9 * sqrt sqrt]
```

Key Changes:
- Focused on retaining impactful transformations like `sqrt` and interaction terms.
- Eliminated overly complex or less interpretable combinations while retaining significant interactions.
- Included double square root transformations sparingly as they might capture nuanced variations in features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2025-10-22 10:06:35,035 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set further based on the two given examples, I will combine some of the concepts from both and introduce a few more transformations that might capture non-linear relationships or interactions between features. The idea is to enrich the feature set with more complex derived features that could potentially give better discrimination for the task at hand.

Here is a suggestion for a better feature set:

```
[f2 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f2 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f7 sqrt ,f2 reciprocal ,f9 reciprocal ,f4 reciprocal ,f7 reciprocal ,
f1 f7 * ,f2 f7 * ,f5 f7 * ,f8 f3 * ,f9 f3 * ,f9 f7 * ,f2 sqrt sqrt ,f8 sqrt sqrt ,f9 sqrt sqrt ,
f2 f3 * sqrt ,f2 f7 * sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,
f1 f7 * log ,f2 cube ,f5 cube ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f6 quan_trans ,f3 stand_scaler ]
```

Explanation of some transformations used:
- `reciprocal`: introduces non-linear transformations that can capture inverse relationships which are often useful especially for features like blood pressure and cholesterol.
- `cube`: explores higher degree polynomial features, which can be critical if nonlinear interactions describe the data well.
- `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`: different scaling techniques to ensure features are on the same scale.
- `log`: can stabilize variance and achieve normality especially for skewed features like cholesterol.

This feature set blends transformations and interactions to capture both linear and non-linear relationships, potentially improving prediction performance for heart disease presence.

### Explanation
1. **Non-linear Transformations**: Include multiple square root transformations and combinations of features to capture more complex relationships.
2. **Feature Interactions**: Combinations like `f0 f10 *`, `f1 f9 *`, and `f8 f6 *` capture potential interactions between age, cholesterol levels, chest pain, heart rate, and other factors.
3. **Further Transformations**: The introduction of additional transformations like the logarithmic and scaling (standardization and min-max) can normalize the distributions. Logs for skewed features (`f5 log`) and scaling (`f6 stand_scaler`, `f9 minmax_scaler`) for features would help.
4. **Creating Interaction Effects**: Using `f0 f10 /` for ratio-based interaction and `f0 f10 +` for summation-based combination can uncover hidden patterns.

2025-10-22 10:06:51,192 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set while maintaining the format, I'll build upon the existing features from the latter example and optimize it further. I will focus on a combination of more complex interactions and transformations that may capture additional latent patterns in the data:

In this improved feature set, I've included:

1. Interaction features such as `f9 f10 *` to capture interactions between `f9` and `f10`.
2. A transformed summation with square root, `f2 f9 + sqrt`, providing a non-linear combination of `f2` and `f9`.
3. A new interaction transformation `f4 f10 * sqrt`, aiming to capture deeper relations between `f4` and `f10`.

These additional features provide opportunities to better model complex relationships in the dataset which could enhance the prediction of heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

- I've retained the core feature transformations and added new ones to capture additional interactions, such as `f10 f8 *`, which may be relevant for capturing more complex relations between these features and the target. 
- The transformations also emphasize non-linear relationships through operations like `sqrt` on specific interactions.
- Additionally, I included `f5 f10 * sqrt` and `f9 f10 * sqrt`, offering transformations on interactions that were not directly explored in the initial examples. This should provide a broader basis for nonlinear pattern recognition.

2025-10-22 10:07:07,519 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we should aim to combine aspects of both feature sets and introduce transformations that could capture different relationships or characteristics in the data. By examining the given feature sets, we can select and combine elements from both to create a potentially more informative feature set.

Here is the new combined and potentially improved feature set:

```
[f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f0 f2 *, f0 f10 *, f1 f9 *, f8 f2 *, f9 f8 *, f10 f0 *, f10 f1 *, f10 f5 *, f10 f10 *, f1 f9 * sqrt, f0 f10 * sqrt, f2 f0 * sqrt, f5 f8 * sqrt, f8 f2 * sqrt, f2 f2 * sqrt, f8 f6 * sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt, f1 f10 * sqrt, f8 f8 * sqrt, f2 sqrt, f0 f2 * sqrt, f10 f0 * sqrt, f10 f1 * sqrt, f1 f9 * sqrt sqrt, f10 f5 * sqrt, f10 f10 * sqrt, f0 f0 f2 * *, f8 f10 /, f10 f1 +, f2 f4 log, f7 sigmoid]
```

In this feature set, elements from both provided examples have been blended, and additional operations have been introduced to allow extraction of more nuanced patterns and relationships in the data:
- `[f0 f0 f2 * *]`: Represents a more complex polynomial interaction between features 0 (possibly age) and feature 2.
- `[f8 f10 /]`: Involves division, which could emphasize the relative rate between these features.
- `[f10 f1 +]`: Adds features 10 and 1, which may highlight cumulative effects.
- `[f2 f4 log]`: Applies a logarithmic transformation that can help in normalizing skewed data.
- `[f7 sigmoid]`: Uses the sigmoid function, often beneficial for bounding values between 0 and 1, accommodating non-linear relationships.

These added features may help in capturing new insights into the data, potentially improving prediction of heart disease presence.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here are the modifications and additions:

- Introduced variety in transformations like `sinh` and `cosh` to diversify non-linear transformations.
- Added `f10 f9 + cube`, another complex interaction that might be beneficial.
- Incorporated `reciprocal` in `f10 f1 + reciprocal` as a non-linear feature introduction.
- Maintained a balanced use of scaling functions like `minmax_scaler` to normalize interactions and promote better model convergence.
- Consistently used a combination of arithmetic operations (`+`) alongside transformations to generate interaction terms.

2025-10-22 10:07:25,886 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we'll start by analyzing the operations and feature interactions provided in the previous two sets. We will focus on ensuring diverse transformations and interactions to potentially capture non-linear relationships and complex patterns in the data that could be useful for the prediction task.

Here's a new feature set combining and enhancing the elements from the given examples:

- Include direct features for potential useful standalone data: `[f10]`
- Square root transformation to help linearize potential non-linear relationships: `[f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f9 sqrt]`
- Interaction terms (products) to capture interactions between features: `[f0 f2 *, f0 f10 *, f1 f9 *, f2 f0 *, f2 f2 *, f8 f2 *, f8 f6 *, f9 f8 *, f10 f0 *, f10 f1 *, f10 f5 *, f10 f10 *]`
- Rooted interaction terms to potentially help in normalizing and scaling data in a way that emphasizes feature interactions: `[f1 f9 * sqrt, f0 f10 * sqrt, f2 f0 * sqrt, f5 f8 * sqrt, f8 f2 * sqrt, f2 f2 * sqrt, f8 sqrt sqrt, f8 f6 * sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt, f1 f10 * sqrt, f8 f8 * sqrt, f2 sqrt, f0 f2 * sqrt]`
- Additional new interactions to add more diverse post-transformations: `[f9 f10 *, f8 f9 *, f8 f1 *, f2 f10 *, f0 f5 *]`

By incorporating these transformations and interactions, the feature set can help the model capture more complex relationships within the data, therefore potentially leading to better predictions. The final feature set is:

```
[f10, f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f0 f2 *, f0 f10 *, f1 f9 *, f2 f0 *, f2 f2 *, f8 f2 *, f8 f6 *, f9 f8 *, f10 f0 *, f10 f1 *, f10 f5 *, f10 f10 *, f1 f9 * sqrt, f0 f10 * sqrt, f2 f0 * sqrt, f5 f8 * sqrt, f8 f2 * sqrt, f2 f2 * sqrt, f8 sqrt sqrt, f8 f6 * sqrt, f10 sqrt sqrt, f1 f10 * sqrt, f8 f8 * sqrt, f2 sqrt, f0 f2 * sqrt, f9 f10 *, f8 f9 *, f8 f1 *, f2 f10 *, f0 f5 *]

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this improved feature set:
- Several sqrt and multiplication operations are kept as transformations, which offer non-linear combinations of features.
- New operations such as addition and division, as well as logarithmic transformation, are introduced to enhance feature representation and potentially capture different relationships between features.
- Redundant transformations have been minimized by eliminating less impactful features while introducing new combined transformations.

- Some repetitive transformations from the previous sets were removed in favor of more diverse operations to explore a wider feature space.
- The logarithm and other statistical measure features have been added to help in capturing non-linear trends or mitigate the effect of outliers.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

1. **Division**: The new feature `f2 f6 * /` aims to explore the ratio between two existing combinations, potentially capturing relative magnitudes that could be important for prediction.

2. **Standard Scaling**: `f5 stand_scaler` applies standard scaling to one of the features, helping to normalize the impact of this feature across different scales, which is particularly useful in linear models.

These transformations are intended to enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data, which can improve the prediction of heart disease presence.

2025-10-22 10:07:49,720 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we will aim to combine transformations that can capture non-linear relationships and enhance the separability of features important for predicting heart disease. Given the features from the two examples, here's a suggested feature set:

- Include original features to preserve the baseline information:
  - `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12]`

- Strengthen useful features with nonlinear transformations:
  - Square roots to reduce the scale and compress high values:
    - `[f2 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f0 sqrt]`

- Employ scaling to normalize data, making the model less sensitive to outliers:
  - `[f0 stand_scaler, f9 sqrt sqrt]`

- Additional transformations that capture complex relations and interactions:
  - Utilize sigmoid to compress feature values between 0 and 1, especially for cardiovascular metrics
    - `[f10 sigmoid]`

- Combining features for interaction terms:
  - Multiply interactions that may have a strong effect on prediction when combined:
    - `[f1 f7 *, f2 f3 *, f2 f7 *, f8 f3 *, f8 f7 *, f9 f3 *, f9 f7 *]`

- Square transformations to exploit polynomial trends:
  - `[f3 f4 * sqrt, f7 sqrt sqrt]`
