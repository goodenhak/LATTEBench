   - Reasoning: Converting the employment category to numerical values can provide the model with a sense of order or hierarchy among the different categories, improving its understanding of the feature's importance.

2. \<credit_amount_log\>\<log\>\<credit_amount\>\<Log_transform_of_credit_amount_for_skewness_reduction\>  
   - Reasoning: The distribution of the credit_amount might be skewed. Applying a log transformation can normalize the distribution, helping the model handle extreme values and make better predictions.

3. \<age_property_interaction\>\<cross\>\<age_group\>\<property_magnitude\>\<Interaction_between_age_group_and_property_magnitude\>  
   - Reasoning: The cross product of age_group and property_magnitude could reveal patterns in how different age groups with various property holdings influence credit approval, adding an interaction feature that may capture complex relationships.

2025-11-08 16:55:23,595 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! The task at hand involves feature engineering to potentially improve predictions in a credit approval model. Here are three possible steps to generate new features using the provided operators, along with the reasoning behind each:

1. Given the importance of the interaction between financial variables and employment status, creating a comprehensive interaction can provide insights into applicant risk.

   - Reasoning: Interactions between key features can capture non-linear relationships that may significantly influence creditworthiness.

   
   <financial_employment_interaction><concat><savings_status><employment_savings_status><interaction_between_savings_and_employment_status>
   

2. Constructing a feature that indicates the wealth/prosperity level by leveraging credit_amount and duration may reveal nuances in an applicant's credit behavior over time.

   - Reasoning: A normalized indicator of credit allocated over time can help discern the burden or ease with which applicants handle their debt.

   
   <credit_prosperity_index><divide><credit_amount><duration><normalized_credit_per_duration>
   

3. Incorporating temporal dynamics by examining the trend in birth year may shed light on certain generational behaviors or tendencies in financial management.

   - Reasoning: Age-related behavior changes over time may help identify older or younger applicants' financial maturity levels.

   
   <birth_year><subtract><current_year><age><year_of_birth_of_applicant>
   

These new features aim to capture deeper relationships between the applicant's financial attributes and fiscal behavior over time, which could lead to more accurate predictions by the downstream model.

2025-11-08 16:55:41,406 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_age_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<age\>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_age_to_examine_if_young_borrowers_are_requesting_higher_credits\>

   Reasoning: This feature captures the proportion of credit amount relative to the age of the borrower. Younger borrowers requesting large credits might have different risk profiles compared to older borrowers.

2. \<employment_duration_savings_cross\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<savings_status\>\<Interaction_between_employment_duration_and_savings_status_to_analyze_their_joint_impact_on_credit_decision\>

   Reasoning: This cross feature analyzes the combination of employment duration and savings status, which can provide insights into the financial stability and creditworthiness of the applicant.

3. \<normalized_installment_commitment\>\<zscore\>\<installment_commitment\>\<Z-score_normalization_of_installment_commitment_to_analyze_how_extreme_an_individual's_commitment_is_in_the_population\>

   Reasoning: By normalizing the installment commitment, we can examine how extreme an individual's commitment is compared to the population, potentially identifying those who might struggle with high commitments.
