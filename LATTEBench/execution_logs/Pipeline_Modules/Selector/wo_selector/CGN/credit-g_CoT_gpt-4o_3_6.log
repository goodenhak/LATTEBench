   *Reasoning*: Credit amounts can often be highly skewed, and taking the logarithm can help normalize this skew. A normalized distribution can be beneficial for many machine learning models, improving their predictive performance.

2. \<employment_duration_interaction\><multiply>\<employment><duration\>\<Interaction_between_employment_and_duration_to_capture_combined_effect_on_creditworthiness\>
   
   *Reasoning*: Multiplying employment and duration can capture how the length of employment combined with the credit duration impacts credit risk. Longer employment might mitigate the risk of longer credit durations.

   Explanation: This feature combines savings account status and employment status, which could provide insight into the applicant's financial stability. People with higher savings and stable employment are often considered more creditworthy.

2. \<normalized_duration\>\<zscore\><duration>\<zscore_normalization_of_duration_to_handle_outliers>
   
   Explanation: Normalizing the duration variable can help mitigate the effect of outliers and bring all values of this feature to a similar scale. This can improve model convergence and performance.

3. \<credit_to_property_ratio\>\<ratio\><credit_amount><property_magnitude>\<ratio_of_credit_amount_to_property_magnitude_for_assessing_credit_risk>

   Explanation: This feature calculates the ratio of credit amount to property magnitude. People requesting a high credit amount with lesser property magnitude might pose higher credit risk, making it an important factor for decision-making.

2025-11-08 17:03:47,181 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the given operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<log_credit_amount\><log\><credit_amount\>\<Log_transformation_of_credit_amount_to_smooth_out_large_values_and_reduce_skewness>
   - Reasoning: The credit_amount feature can have a wide range of values and may be skewed. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help normalize these values, making patterns easier to detect by the model.

2. \<employment_duration_interaction\><cross\><employment\><duration\>\<Interaction_between_employment_duration_to_capture_combined_effect_on_credit_risk>
   - Reasoning: The duration of credit and the employment status could interact in a way that significantly affects credit risk. Creating a cross feature allows the model to capture these interactions.

3. \<credit_risk_score\><ratio\><credit_amount_to_duration_ratio\><installment_commitment\>\<Ratio_of_existing_credit_risk_to_installment_commitment_to_assess_affordability>
   - Reasoning: Comparing the ratio of credit amount to duration with installment commitment could give insights into a customer's affordability metrics, providing valuable information for credit approval decisions.

   * This feature already exists in the dataset as credit_amount_to_duration_ratio. However, including this operation highlights the importance of balancing credit amount with the duration, which is essential in assessing credit risk and can improve predictions by capturing the proportionality between loan size and repayment time.

2. \<employment_checking_label_encode\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<checking_status\>\<Encoded_relationship_between_employment_and_checking_account_status\>  
   * By encoding the cross feature of employment and checking_status, we aim to numerically capture the complex interactions between employment stability and checking account balance. This could provide insights on how an individual's employment status may correlate with their checking account status, influencing their creditworthiness.

3. \<credit_installment_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<installment_commitment\>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment\>  
   * This feature calculates the ratio of the credit amount to the installment commitment, and it helps to assess how much of the credit amount is being paid off at each installment. Lower ratios might indicate potential financial strain, whereas higher ratios could imply better management of credit, thus potentially improving the downstream model's prediction performance.

   Reasoning: This feature helps in understanding the financial burden of the credit amount relative to the individual's installment commitment. A higher ratio might indicate higher financial risk.

2. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Cross_feature_to_explore_combined_impact_of_checking_and_savings_account_status_on_credit_decision>

3. <employment_stability_score><multiply><employment><residence_since><Score_for_employment_stability_based_on_job_duration_and_residence_length>

   Reasoning: By multiplying the number of years employed with years of residence, this feature captures a combined stability score, reflecting both employment and residential stability, which could be indicative of a lower credit risk.
