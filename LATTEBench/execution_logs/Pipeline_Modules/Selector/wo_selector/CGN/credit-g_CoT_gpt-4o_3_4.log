   Reasoning: By encoding checking_status to numeric values, we can leverage mathematical operations and integrate it more effectively in numerical models, potentially improving our predictive model's accuracy.

2. <employment_savings_ratio><ratio><employment><<numerical_feature>savings_status><Create_a_ratio_of_employment_to_savings_status_to_examine_financial_stability>

   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio between employment duration and savings status can provide insight into the applicant's financial stability, potentially enhancing the model's ability to predict credit approval.

3. <credit_purpose_history_cross><cross><credit_history><purpose><Explore_the_combination_between_credit_history_and_purpose_and_its_impact_on_credit_decision>

   Reasoning: Understanding the interaction between credit history and purpose can reveal patterns that affect credit decisions, allowing the model to capture complex behavioral trends and improve predictiveness.

3. <employment_checking_cross><cross><employment><checking_status><Interaction_between_employment_and_checking_status_for_creditworthiness_analysis>

Explanation:
1. duration_savings_ratio: Creating a ratio of duration to savings status can help assess the financial stability and willingness to commit long-term based on existing savings. The idea is that higher duration with lower savings might indicate financial risk.

2. credit_per_property: This feature reflects the relationship between the credit amount and the property magnitude, which can be indicative of collateral. This is useful in assessing the risk associated with the credit amount in relation to the assets owned by the individual.

3. employment_checking_cross: Crossing employment status with checking account status could reveal patterns related to financial behavior, stability, and creditworthiness, since both factors are closely tied to financial reliability.
