1. <age_duration_ratio><divide><age><duration><Ratio_of_age_to_loan_duration>
   - Reasoning: Examining the ratio of the applicant's age to the duration of the loan could highlight maturity and repayment reliability relative to the loan period.

2. <employment_length_encoding><label_encode><employment><Numerical_conversion_of_employment_length>
   - Reasoning: Converting the employment categorical variable into numerical form could help the model weigh employment stability.

3. <credit_amount_per_installment><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Credit_amount_relative_to_installment_commitment>

2. \<savings_status_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<savings_status\>\<Encoded_categorical_savings_status\>  
   - Label encoding a categorical feature like savings_status allows for the incorporation of categories into models that can't inherently handle categorical data, thus improving performance.

Explanation:

1. Checking_employment_cross: By creating a cross feature between checking_status and employment, we capture the joint effect of these features which might better capture the financial stability of an applicant. For instance, a person with a high checking balance and long-term employment might be viewed more favorably than someone with a similar checking status but shorter employment history.
   
2. Credit_amount_squared: Squaring the credit_amount can help model any nonlinear relationships between the credit amount and the decision to approve or deny credit. This transformation could capture the effects of very large credit amount requests more effectively, potentially uncovering thresholds or saturation points in the decision-making process.
   
3. Age_to_existing_credits_ratio: By calculating the ratio of age to existing_credits, we gain insight into the applicant’s borrowing behavior throughout their lifetime. This feature could help identify applicants who are over-leveraged for their age or those who have responsibly managed their credit load over a longer period.

Explanation:
1. Employment Encoded: By converting the categorical employment feature into a numerical one using label encoding, we can leverage any implicit ordering in the employment categories, such as the stability and reliability of a person's employment, which may influence creditworthiness.
   
2. Credit to Income Ratio: This feature is a standard financial metric that assesses the proportion of credit amount to income (approximated by installment commitment). A higher ratio might indicate a higher financial burden, which could affect credit approval decisions.

3. Total Dependents by Job: By calculating the average number of dependents for each job type through a group-by operation, we capture the potential financial obligations associated with different employment categories. This could provide insights into an individual's disposable income and ability to repay credit.

3. \<credit_amount_log\>\<log\>\<credit_amount\>\<Log_transformation_of_credit_amount_for_skewness_reduction\>

Explanation:

1. Employment Encoded: The employment category may have a significant impact on credit approval. Encoding this feature numerically could help machine learning models better understand the ordinal nature of employment levels, thus potentially improving prediction performance.

2. Checking Status and Savings Cross: Creating an interaction feature between checking status and savings status may provide insights into an individual's financial stability. This can be particularly useful for the credit approval task, as those with a negative checking status or low savings might be less likely to receive credit.

3. Credit Amount Log: Applying a log transformation to the credit amount can help reduce skewness in the data. This can benefit linear models and others sensitive to skewed distributions by providing a more normalized feature for model training, improving the consistency of predictions across various credit amount ranges.
