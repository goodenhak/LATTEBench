The latter example incorporates more diverse transformations and various scalers, which can be beneficial. Let's construct a new feature set with these ideas:

In this set, various operations such as `reciprocal`, `quan_trans`, and `cos` have been applied to extend upon the transformation depth, while feature scalers like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` have also been incorporated to refine the range of values. Additionally, I condensed and combined transformations where applicable for brevity and better representation, taking advantage of the operations that seemed more prevalent and effective across both examples.

```

In this set, I've maintained the original operations and introduced additional transformations using `minmax_scaler`, `sqrt`, and added a final `reciprocal` transformation based on the second example, aiming to increase feature diversity while keeping consistency with the previous examples.

This version takes the original feature set and applies a number of additional transformations such as square root on reciprocals, standard scaling followed by square root, and includes other mathematical transformations like sigmoid, log, square, cube, and trigonometric transformations on the features f5 through f15. This diverse set of operations might reveal more complex patterns in the data.

- Added complexity by cascading transformations like reciprocal and cube.
- Introduced combinations of trigonometric transformations with arithmetic operations.
- Used deeper combinations of operations to potentially capture nonlinear relationships more effectively.

2026-02-01 19:16:36,048 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two examples provided, the objective is to generate a better feature set by integrating ideas from both examples. The aim is to create a feature set with diverse transformations that potentially enhance the representational capacity of the features.

Here is a new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f3 ,f4 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f0 cube ,f1 cube ,f6 cube ,f7 cube ,f8 cube ,f9 cube ,f10 cube ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f4 reciprocal square ,f6 reciprocal square ,f7 reciprocal square ,f8 reciprocal square ,f5 cos ,f9 cos ,f18 cos ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f8 sigmoid ,f9 sigmoid ,f10 sigmoid ,f0 log ,f21 log ,f9 f18 + stand_scaler ,f5 cos reciprocal square stand_scaler ,f9 quan_trans minmax_scaler ,f5 cube reciprocal square quan_trans ,f5 cos reciprocal square quan_trans ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal minmax_scaler ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal minmax_scaler ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal minmax_scaler]
```

In this new feature set, I combined transformation techniques such as `cube`, `reciprocal`, `square`, `cos`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `log`, and different scaling methods (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`). I chose combinations that are likely to enrich the feature representation while borrowing ideas from both examples provided.

New Feature Set:
```
[f4, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f16, f17, f9 f9 *, f0 reciprocal, f0 reciprocal reciprocal, f1 reciprocal reciprocal, f11 f9 +, f9 sqrt, f9 f5 -, f9 f0 +, f9 quan_trans, f4 sin, f9 f9 sqrt +, f5 cos quan_trans, f9 f5 sin +, f9 f5 sigmoid +, f9 f3 reciprocal +, f9 f5 sigmoid reciprocal +, f5 cos reciprocal square quan_trans, f9 stand_scaler, f9 f5 sigmoid reciprocal reciprocal +, f9 f9 f5 - +]
```

This new feature set combines elements from both examples, emphasizing transformations like reciprocal, sqrt, and quan_trans, along with feature interactions (sum, difference, product) and advanced transformations (sigmoid, sin, cos handling). This approach aims to capture diverse data representations potentially useful for modeling tasks.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f5 stand_scaler ,f10 sqrt ,f12 log ,f13 cos ,f14 sin ,f15 sigmoid ,f6 f7 * ,f8 f9 /] 

In this new feature set:
- I retained transformations which seemed productive such as `reciprocal`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `sqrt`.
- I added additional transformations including `log`, `cos`, `sin`, and `sigmoid` which are common transformation techniques and can add more non-linearity and depth to the feature set.
- Integrated combinations with basic arithmetic operations like multiplication (*) and division (/) to create potential interactions between features.

Explanation:
- Included basic features and common transformations from both sets.
- Added extra transformations where transformations could be further refined.
- Opted to leverage both `reciprocal` and `cube` transformations which were prevalent in both example sets.
- Integrated additional functions such as `sqrt`, `log`, and `sigmoid` to increase the variability and scalability of the feature set.

Key enhancements include:

1. **Complex Combinations**: Features such as `f2 cube cube` and `f2 reciprocal reciprocal` enhanced through multiple applications of the cube and reciprocal operations.
   
2. **New Transformations**: Included `f9 sigmoid`, a transformation not previously used, which might help in scenarios requiring normalization between 0 and 1.

3. **Logarithmic and Trigonometric Enhancements**: Combinations such as `f9 f19 log +` and `f14 tanh sin` further improve feature diversity and capability.

4. **Increased Non-linearity**: `f1 f7 * cube`, utilizing multiplication followed by cubing, heightens the nonlinear transformation potential.

This new feature set attempts to leverage a range of complex transformations to maximize the informative power and variability for modeling.
