2025-11-09 16:55:53,250 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions on whether a person receives credit, we can generate new features using the given operators. Here's a strategy for feature engineering:

1. Create interactions between relevant features to capture relationships and patterns that might not be evident in the original features. 
2. Transform numerical features to a different scale or range to improve model performance.
3. Encode categorical features to numerical values for better model interpretation and handling.

Here are three possible steps:

1. <credit_amount_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><This feature represents the ratio of credit amount to loan duration, which can capture the individual's creditworthiness and affordability. Higher ratios may indicate greater risk.>

2. <employment_duration_product><multiply><employment><duration><This feature captures the interaction between employment duration and loan duration. Longer employment combined with longer loan duration might indicate stability and likelihood of repayment.>

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Convert the categorical savings_status feature to numerical values to facilitate better integration with other numerical features and improve model handling.>


These steps aim to capture relationships and encode categorical data effectively to improve the model's predictive accuracy.
