   - Reasoning: Credit-related features can be highly skewed, and applying a square root transformation can help address this skewness. This may allow the model to capture patterns more effectively by stabilizing variance.

2. <credit_housing_cross><cross><credit_history><housing><Interaction feature capturing the combined effect of credit history and housing status>
   - Reasoning: Credit history and housing status can interact in non-linear ways to impact credit approval decisions. By creating a cross feature, the model may capture insights from their combined influence on creditworthiness.

3. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Log transformation of credit amount to manage skewness and emphasize relative differences>
   - Reasoning: Credit amounts can have a wide range of values, leading to potential skewness in the data. A log transformation can help in handling this by emphasizing smaller differences while managing outliers, making it easier for the model to learn.

2025-11-07 20:33:49,053 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps to generate new features that may improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_housing_encoded_cross><cross><credit_history><housing><Interactionfeaturecapturingthecombinedeffectofcredithistoryandhousingstatus,whichmaybetterrepresentindividual'sfinancialstabilityandpriorities>  
   Reasoning: While a similar feature was previously rejected, combining credit history and housing through a different transformation might better capture financial stability and prioritization dynamics. This could provide a deeper insight into the financial habits and commitments a person might hold.

2. <savings_duration_ratio><divide><savings_status_encoded><duration><Ratioofsavingsstatusdurationspanningtohighlighttherelativefinancialsituationincontextoffinancialcommitmentperiod>  
   Reasoning: By comparing the numeric encoding of savings status with the duration, this feature aims to gauge how savings levels relate to the length of financial commitments. It offers an understanding of whether larger or smaller savings status states correspond with longer or shorter durations, lending insight into financial capability and risk.

3. <telephone_property_cross><cross><own_telephone><property_magnitude><Interactionfeaturecapturingthecombinedeffectofpropertymagnitudeandtheavailabilityofatelephone,whichcouldreflectcommunicationaccessibilityandassetportfolioimpactingcreditdecisions>  
   Reasoning: This feature combines the presence of a telephone and property ownership, which could indicate the level of access to communication facilities and asset holdings. It can be particularly relevant in understanding financial and infrastructural stability in decision-making contexts.
