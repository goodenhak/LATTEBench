3. <new_feature_age_sin><sine><age><Sine_transformation_of_age_to_capture_periodic_relationships>

Explanation:

1. Credit Duration Ratio: Calculating the ratio of credit amount to duration can give insights into the amount of credit borrowed relative to the time period in which it is expected to be repaid. This feature could help in identifying individuals who might be borrowing more than they can repay given the credit duration, indicating a higher risk.

2. Savings Employment Cross: Creating an interaction between savings status and employment status can help identify the impact of both financial savings and employment stability on credit risk. People with lower savings and unstable employment might present different risk profiles compared to those with stable employment and higher savings, making this a potentially valuable feature for prediction.

3. Age Sine Transformation: Applying a sine transformation to the age feature introduces non-linearity that could help capture any periodic or cyclic patterns in credit behavior related to age. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where age-related patterns are not strictly linear (e.g., younger individuals might have different credit behavior than middle-aged ones).

2025-11-07 20:29:55,302 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature generation using the available operations:

1. Create a feature to capture the relative age of the person compared to their employment duration:
   
   <new_feature_age_to_employment_ratio><ratio><age><employment><Ratio_of_age_to_employment_duration>
   
   *Reasoning*: This feature may provide insights into the maturity and financial stability of a person in relation to their work experience, potentially highlighting the individual's capacity to repay the credit.

2. Create a feature to explore the interaction between housing status and employment:
   
   <new_feature_housing_employment_cross><cross><housing><employment><Interaction_between_housing_status_and_employment>
   
   *Reasoning*: The interaction between housing status and employment can be an indicator of financial stability and creditworthiness. For example, individuals who own a home and have stable employment might be more creditworthy.

3. Encode the credit history for numerical interactions:
   
   <new_feature_credit_history_encoded><label_encode><credit_history><Label_encoding_for_credit_history>
   
   *Reasoning*: By encoding the credit history as numerical values, it becomes possible to include this feature in numerical interactions or calculations, which might reveal patterns associated with creditworthiness.

2025-11-07 20:29:58,737 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <new_feature_credit_amount_sqrt><sqrt><credit_amount><Square_root_of_credit_amount>  
   Reasoning: Taking the square root of the credit amount can help reduce skewness and stabilize variance, which might be valuable for linear models sensitive to non-linear relationships.

2. <new_feature_employment_duration_ratio><ratio><employment><duration><Ratio_of_employment_to_credit_duration>  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between how long a person is employed relative to the credit duration. A higher ratio might indicate a more stable employment in relation to the credit term length.

3. <new_feature_property_residence_cross><cross><property_magnitude><residence_since><Interaction_between_property_type_and_years_of_residence>  
   Reasoning: Combining property magnitude with years of residence may capture stability or risk factors related to personal property management and long-term residence, potentially influencing creditworthiness.

   Reasoning: Combining the duration for which the credit is sought and the credit history may uncover patterns on how people's past credit behaviors interact with the loan term duration they're applying for.

2. <new_feature_age_property_cross><cross><age><property_magnitude><Interaction_between_age_and_property_magnitude>  
   Reasoning: This feature explores how the age of individuals might correlate with the type of property associated with their credit, potentially indicating different credit needs or risks at various life stages.

3. <new_feature_employment_savings_ratio><ratio><employment><savings_status><Ratio_of_employment_years_to_savings_account_status>  
   Reasoning: By examining the ratio of employment years against savings account status, potential insights can be gained into the financial stability and maturity of the credit applicant, which might inform their ability to manage loans effectively.

2025-11-07 20:30:22,662 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps for feature generation to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Create a feature to capture possible interactions between credit history and property magnitude:

   - Feature: <new_feature_credit_property_cross><cross><credit_history><property_magnitude><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_property_type>
   - Reasoning: This feature can help identify if certain types of properties are associated with specific credit histories, potentially influencing credit approval.

2. Develop a feature that combines personal status information with age, helping capture demographic patterns:

   - Feature: <new_feature_personal_status_age_cross><cross><personal_status><age><Interaction_between_personal_status_and_age_to_estimate_demographic_influence_on_credit>
   - Reasoning: This interaction could uncover patterns showing how age combined with personal status affects credit acquisition likelihood, offering insights into demographic influences on creditworthiness.

3. Create a feature assessing how employment history interacts with the number of existing credits:

   - Feature: <new_feature_employment_existing_credits_cross><cross><employment><existing_credits><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_existing_credits_to_estimate_credit_management_skills>
   - Reasoning: The ability to manage multiple credits could be influenced by employment stability. Capturing this interaction may indicate successful credit management, contributing to creditworthiness evaluation.

2025-11-07 20:30:26,939 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 2109, 'completion_tokens': 224, 'total_tokens': 2333}
2025-11-07 20:30:26,939 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <new_feature_age_credit_duration_ratio><ratio><age><credit_amount><Age_based_scale_of_credit_amount_to_estimate_financial_maturity>
   - Reasoning: This feature represents the ratio of age to credit amount. It aims to capture whether older individuals receive proportionally larger credit amounts, possibly indicating higher financial maturity and reliability.

2. <new_feature_installment_residence_cross><cross><installment_commitment><residence_since><Interaction_between_installment_commitment_and_years_of_residence>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between installment commitment and years of residence can indicate stability. A stable residence history combined with installment commitment might reflect an individual's ability to manage credit over time.

3. <new_feature_job_duplicate_encoded><label_encode><job><Encoding_job_description_to_numerical_value>
   - Reasoning: Encoding job details into numerical values may help in analyzing patterns related to employment type and credit approval. Different occupations may have varied credit risk profiles.

These steps focus on capturing insights related to financial maturity, stability, and employment type, all potentially useful for enhancing credit prediction models.
