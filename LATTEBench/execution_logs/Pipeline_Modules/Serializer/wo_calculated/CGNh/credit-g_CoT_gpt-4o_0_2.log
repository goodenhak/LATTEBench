2025-11-07 20:32:05,475 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark.
duration: Duration in months
savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark.
credit_history: Credit history
credit_amount: Credit amount
own_telephone: Telephone
other_payment_plans: Other installment plans (banks, stores)
housing: Housing (rent, own,...)
installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income
personal_status: Personal status (married, single,...) and sex

Data Examples:
checking_status is <0. duration is 12. savings_status is <100. credit_history is existing paid. credit_amount is 1228. own_telephone is none. other_payment_plans is none. housing is own. installment_commitment is 4. personal_status is female div/dep/mar.
Answer: 0
checking_status is <0. duration is 36. savings_status is <100. credit_history is existing paid. credit_amount is 2712. own_telephone is none. other_payment_plans is bank. housing is own. installment_commitment is 2. personal_status is male single.
Answer: 0
checking_status is no checking. duration is 9. savings_status is <100. credit_history is existing paid. credit_amount is 2697. own_telephone is none. other_payment_plans is none. housing is own. installment_commitment is 1. personal_status is male single.
Answer: 1
checking_status is <0. duration is 48. savings_status is <100. credit_history is existing paid. credit_amount is 7476. own_telephone is yes. other_payment_plans is none. housing is for free. installment_commitment is 4. personal_status is male single.
Answer: 1
