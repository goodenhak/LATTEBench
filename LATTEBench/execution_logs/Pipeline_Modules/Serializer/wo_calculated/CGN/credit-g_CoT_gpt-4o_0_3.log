2025-11-07 20:06:35,349 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_to_income_exp\> \<exp\> \<credit_to_income_ratio\> \<Apply_exponential_transformation_to_credit_to_income_ratio_to_captivate_large_values_effectively\>  
   
   Reasoning: Applying an exponential transformation might help capture the effects of large credit-to-income ratio values. This could be especially beneficial if these outliers significantly impact credit decisions.

2. \<age_group\> \<bin\> \<age_duration_ratio\> \<Bin_age_duration_ratio_into_quantiles_to_capture_age_effect_on_loan_duration_more_robustly\>  

   Reasoning: Binning age-to-duration ratios into quantiles can help capture non-linear effects and age-related trends that might impact credit eligibility. This is useful if certain age brackets lead to different credit outcomes.

3. \<employment_history_score\> \<cross\> \<employment\>\<credit_history\> \<Combine_employment_and_credit_history_to_generate_a_composite_feature_showcasing_work_and_credit_stability\>  

   Reasoning: Combining employment and credit history can produce a composite feature indicating a person’s work and credit stability. A strong history in both can be a good indicator of creditworthiness.
