2025-11-07 20:04:33,344 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<employment_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<employment\>\<Encode_employment_category_into_numerical_format_to_facilitate_model_input\>

   Reasoning: Encoding the 'employment' feature into numerical form can help the model capture the ordinal nature of employment categories, which can be important for understanding credit risk related to employment stability.

2. \<credit_savings_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<savings_status\>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_status_for_measuring_financial_stability\>

   Reasoning: The ratio of 'credit_amount' to 'savings_status' is indicative of how much credit a person has taken relative to their savings. This can provide insights into the financial behavior and risk level of the individual.

3. \<checking_employment_cross\>\<cross\>\<checking_status\>\<employment_encoded\>\<Interaction_between_checking_status_and_employment_for_relationship_analysis\>

   Reasoning: Creating a cross feature between 'checking_status' and the newly encoded 'employment_encoded' could reveal insights about the joint effect of current checking account status and employment stability on credit risk. This interaction may capture complex patterns not evident through individual features.

2025-11-07 20:04:43,912 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 685, 'completion_tokens': 210, 'total_tokens': 895}
2025-11-07 20:04:43,912 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_amount_per_month\divide\credit_amount\duration\The average credit amount that needs to be repaid each month\>  
   Reasoning: Calculating the credit amount per month helps in understanding the ability of the individual to repay the credit. If this monthly amount is low compared to their disposable income, it might indicate a higher likelihood of receiving credit.

2. \<employment_encoded\label_encode\employment\Convert the employment feature into a numerical format, providing a numerical scale of employment duration\>  
   Reasoning: Converting the employment feature into a numerical format allows models to quantify employment stability, which is essential for assessing creditworthiness. Longer employment usually implies higher stability.

3. \<financial_status\cross\checking_status\savings_status\Create a combined feature representing the individual's financial status from checking and savings accounts\>  
   Reasoning: Combining checking and savings account statuses into a single feature can provide a more holistic view of the individual’s short-term financial health, enabling better risk assessment and prediction accuracy.

2025-11-07 20:04:51,782 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <checking_savings_combined><cross><checking_status><savings_status><interaction_between_checking_and_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: Combining checking_status and savings_status might reveal insights about the applicant's liquidity and financial stability, which could be a strong indicator for creditworthiness.

2. <credit_installment_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><installment_commitment><credit_to_installment_committment_ratio>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of credit amount to installment commitment can provide a sense of how much credit is being utilized relative to the applicant's stated ability to pay back, impacting the prediction of credit risk.

3. <employment_encoded><label_encode><employment><numerical_representation_of_employment_duration>
   - Reasoning: Encoding the employment feature into a numerical format can help the model better understand and utilize this information, especially with potential non-linear relationships between employment duration and creditworthiness.

2025-11-07 20:04:52,656 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark.
savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark.
credit_amount: Credit amount
duration: Duration in months
installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income
own_telephone: Telephone
employment: Present employment, in number of years.
credit_history_encoded: Label encoding of credit_history to convert categorical data to numerical, facilitating input into the model.

Data Examples:
checking_status is <0. savings_status is 500<=X<1000. credit_amount is 4281. duration is 33. installment_commitment is 1. own_telephone is none. employment is 1<=X<4. credit_history_encoded is 1.
