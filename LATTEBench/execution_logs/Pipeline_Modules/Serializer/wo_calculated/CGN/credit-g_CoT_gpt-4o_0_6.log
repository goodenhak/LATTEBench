   - Reasoning: Encoding categorical features like checking_status into numerical values helps the model to better interpret and utilize these features in the prediction task.

2. \<credit_savings_ratio\><ratio><credit_amount><savings_status><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_providing_insight_into_financial_liquidity>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of credit amount to savings status can provide insights into the applicant's financial liquidity. A lower ratio might indicate a better likelihood of creditworthiness.

3. \<savings_personal_status_cross\><cross><savings_status><personal_status><Interaction_between_savings_status_and_personal_status_to_capture_lifestyle_and_risk_preferences>
   - Reasoning: Creating an interaction between savings_status and personal_status might help capture lifestyle and risk preferences, which could be significant indicators of creditworthiness.

2025-11-07 20:12:09,330 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operators that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <log_credit_amount><log><credit_amount><Logarithm_of_credit_amount_to_handle_skewness_and_reduce_impact_of_large_outliers>
   - Taking the logarithm of the credit amount can help mitigate the effect of large outliers, which might skew the model. This transformation often leads to better model performance by normalizing the data.

2. <checking_status_encoded><label_encode><checking_status><Label_encoding_of_checking_status_to_convert_categorical_to_numeric_for_model_processing>
   - By label encoding the checking_status, we convert the categorical feature into a numerical one that can be more effectively utilized by many machine learning models.

3. <credit_savings_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><savings_status><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_status_provides_a_comparison_of_credit_to_savings_potential_to_assess_financial_stability>
   - Creating a ratio of the credit amount to savings status can provide insights into the applicant's financial stability and ability to repay the credit. This could be a significant feature if the savings status is related to repayment capacity.

credit_age_ratio: Ratio of credit amount to age to assess credit weight relative to applicant's age
other_parties: Other debtors / guarantors
credit_history: Credit history
installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income
savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark.
num_dependents: Number of people being liable to provide maintenance for
credit_amount: Credit amount
other_payment_plans: Other installment plans (banks, stores)
existing_credits: Number of existing credits at this bank
residence_since: Present residence since X years
foreign_worker: Foreign worker
credit_amount_log: Log_transformation_of_credit_amount_to_reduce_skewness_and_handle_outliers
personal_status_label: Convert_personal_status_to_numerical_to_assist_model_differentiation

2025-11-07 20:12:20,649 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps to potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_amount_duration_interaction><multiply><credit_amount><credit_duration_ratio><Combined_effect_of_credit_amount_and_duration_on_credit_risk>
   - Explanation: This feature captures the interaction between the credit amount and the duration ratio. A larger value could indicate higher risk, as large loans over long durations might imply higher financial strain on the borrower.

2. <credit_history_personal_property_cross><cross><credit_history><personal_status_label><savings_property_cross><Combined_effect_of_credit_history_personal_status_and_savings_behavior>
   - Explanation: This feature encapsulates the influence of the applicant's credit history, personal status, and investment behavior on credit approval likelihood. It can help the model differentiate between applicants with similar histories and statuses but different savings and property behaviors.

3. <credit_age_normalized><zscore><credit_age_ratio><Normalization_of_credit_age_ratio_to_compare_applicants_on_standardized_scale>
   - Explanation: By normalizing the credit age ratio, we can compare applicants on a standardized scale, removing the effect of different scales of credit amount and age, making it easier for the model to learn patterns related to credit weight relative to applicant's age.
