   - Reasoning: By creating a ratio of credit amount to the existing credit-to-income ratio, we can better understand the pressure of the requested credit amount on the customer's income. This can reflect the viability of granting credit.

2. \<age_credit_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<age\> \<duration\> \<interaction_between_age_and_credit_duration\>
   - Reasoning: Calculating an interaction term between age and credit duration can capture combined effects that individually might seem insignificant. Younger individuals with longer credit durations or older individuals with short durations might have distinct approval patterns.

3. \<employment_savings_cross\> \<cross\> \<employment_encoded\> \<savings_status\> \<crossed_feature_of_employment_status_and_savings_status\>
   - Reasoning: Combining employment status with savings status could highlight the stability or financial cushion an individual has, offering a valuable insight into creditworthiness based on both current employment and savings behavior.

2025-11-07 20:10:00,708 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance based on the existing features:

1. <credit_duration_interaction><multiply><duration><credit_amount><interaction_between_credit_duration_and_amount_assessing_repayment_capacity>
   - Reasoning: This feature multiplies the credit duration with the credit amount. It captures the interaction between how much credit is requested and for how long, which could indicate the borrower's repayment capacity or risk.

2. <age_credit_to_income_ratio><divide><age><credit_to_income_ratio><relation_between_age_and_credit_to_income_pressure>
   - Reasoning: By dividing age by the credit to income ratio, we evaluate how age influences the pressure of credit to income ratio. Younger applicants with high credit-to-income ratios might be flagged differently than older applicants.

3. <savings_employment_encoded><cross><savings_status><employment_encoded><interaction_between_savings_and_employment_as_combined_indication_of_stability>
   - Reasoning: Crossing savings status with employment status encodings offers a more nuanced view of a consumer's financial stability. Individuals with longer employment and higher savings might be seen as lower risk compared to those without savings or shorter employment histories.

These steps are crafted to uncover deeper patterns that may help improve the accuracy of credit approval predictions by considering interactions and relations between existing features.

   - Reasoning: A logarithmic transformation of the credit amount can help in reducing skewness and making the variable more normally distributed, which often improves the performance of models that assume normality in predictors.

2. <employment_credit_ratio><ratio><employment_encoded><credit_amount><ratio_of_employment_status_to_credit_amount>
   - Reasoning: The relationship between employment status and credit amount could provide insights into creditworthiness. This ratio can help in understanding how different employment levels are related to the amount of credit received.

3. <age_employment_cross><cross><age_bin><employment_encoded><cross_interaction_of_age_bin_and_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between an individual's age and employment status can be a strong predictor of credit approval likelihood. By crossing these two features, we gain insight into how different age groups within various employment statuses might affect credit decisions.

2025-11-07 20:10:17,059 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_history_time_weight><multiply><credit_history><duration><credit_history_weighted_by_time>  
   Credit history can have different types, such as 'existing paid' or 'delayed previously'. By multiplying the credit history feature (after appropriate encoding) with the duration, we can weigh a customer's credit history by the duration of their credit. This may reflect the significance or impact of the credit history over longer periods, potentially bringing valuable insights for credit approval.

2. <credit_residence_interaction><cross><credit_amount><residence_since><interaction_between_credit_amount_and_residence_duration>  
   Combining credit amount with residence duration can help capture the stability and financial behavior of a borrower. A longer residence duration with a higher credit amount might indicate stable financial management, impacting credit decision outcomes.

3. <credit_age_ratio><divide><credit_amount><age><credit_amount_in_relation_to_age>  
   Calculating the ratio of credit amount to age could provide insights into whether the level of credit a person is seeking is proportionate to their life stage. Younger individuals with large credit amounts might be riskier than older individuals with the same amount due to typically lower financial resilience and income stability at a younger age.
