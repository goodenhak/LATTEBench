   Label encoding the categorical feature 'checking_status' to convert it into numerical form. This can help the model better understand the ordinal nature of this feature.

2. \<credit_amount_log\><log\><credit_amount\><log_transformed_credit_amount\>  
   Applying logarithmic transformation to 'credit_amount' to handle any potential skewness in the distribution and to reduce the impact of outliers.

3. \<employment_credit_ratio\><ratio\><employment><credit_amount\><ratio_of_employment_duration_to_credit_amount\>  
   Creating a feature to capture the relationship between the duration of employment and the amount of credit requested. This could indicate financial stability and repayment capability.

2025-11-07 22:18:15,654 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<employment_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<employment\>\<encoded version of the employment status feature\>  
    - Reasoning: Encoding categorical features like employment status can capture nuanced patterns related to employment duration that may impact creditworthiness. The encoded version will allow the model to leverage this categorical information more effectively.

2. \<credit_per_residence_year\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<residence_since\>\<ratio of credit amount to residence duration\>  
    - Reasoning: Calculating the credit amount relative to the number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence may be indicative of stability and responsibility, factors often considered by credit scoring models.

3. \<savings_and_checking\>\<cross\>\<savings_status\>\<checking_status\>\<combined savings and checking status\>  
    - Reasoning: Combining savings status and checking account information can provide insights into the overall financial behavior and liquidity of an individual. Crossing these features can capture interactions between savings and checking that might be predictive for credit approval.

3. <property_employment_cross><cross><property_magnitude><employment><Interaction_between_property_and_employment_status>

Explanation:

1. Square Root of Age: Often, age can have non-linear interactions with other factors in credit approval decisions. Using the square root transformation can help capture such non-linear relationships that might improve model performance by reducing skewness or emphasizing maturity levels.

2. Ratio of Credit Amount to Duration: This feature captures how much credit is given relative to the duration of the loan. A larger ratio might indicate riskier loans (more credit given in a shorter period), and employing such a derived feature can help the model discern patterns that influence the credit decision process.

3. Interaction between Property and Employment Status: Property magnitude combined with employment status can provide insights into socio-economic status and financial stability. By crossing these two features, we create a complex attribute that encapsulates these dimensions. Such interactions can help models to learn nuanced insights, improving predictions.
