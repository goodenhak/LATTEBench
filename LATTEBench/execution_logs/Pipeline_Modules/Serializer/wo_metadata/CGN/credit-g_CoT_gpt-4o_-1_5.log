   Explanation: The interaction between checking status and savings status can capture nuanced relationships in financial behavior that might influence credit decisions. Both of these features are categorical, so cross is appropriate.

2. <employment_age_ratio><ratio><employment><age><relative_time_spent_in_employment_across_age>

   Explanation: This feature provides insight into how long someone has been employed relative to their age, which can indicate stability and work experience, potentially affecting creditworthiness.

3. <credit_amount_normalized><minmax><credit_amount><normalized_credit_amount_between_0_and_1>

   Explanation: Normalizing the credit amount can help bring this feature to a standard scale, making it easier for certain models to handle and potentially improving model performance when dealing with features of varying scales.

2025-11-07 22:25:26,410 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <purpose_checking_status_cross><cross><purpose><checking_status><Interaction_of_purpose_and_checking_status>
   - Reasoning: The cross operation between 'purpose' and 'checking_status' can capture interactions between these two categorical variables, which may provide insights into the applicant's financial behavior related to specific purposes and checking account status.

2. <age_square><square><age><Age_squared_to_capture_nonlinear_relationships>
   - Reasoning: Squaring the 'age' feature can help capture nonlinear relationships between age and the probability of receiving credit. For example, there might be an optimal age range where credit approval is more likely.

3. <credit_amount_per_existing_credit><divide><credit_amount><existing_credits><Credit_amount_allocated_per_existing_credit>
   - Reasoning: By dividing the 'credit_amount' by 'existing_credits', we obtain a new feature representing the average credit allocation to existing credits. This feature may help capture how credit risk is distributed across multiple credits.

   Reasoning: The ratio of the credit amount to the installment commitment could indicate the relative burden of the installment amount compared to the total credit, helping in assessing the individual's repayment capability.

2. <purpose_credit_history_encoded><cross><purpose_credit_history><employment_status_encoded><Interaction_between_purpose_credit_history_and_employment_status_encoded>

   Reasoning: Creating an interaction feature between purpose_credit_history and employment_status_encoded could capture complex relationships and patterns between the individual's credit purpose history and their employment status, potentially revealing important signals about creditworthiness.

3. <age_duration_ratio><divide><age><duration><Ratio_of_age_to_duration>

   Reasoning: The ratio between the individual's age and the credit duration can provide insight into how age correlates with the duration of credits and could be relevant in assessing repayment histories and tendencies among different age groups.
