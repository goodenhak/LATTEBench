2025-11-07 22:26:54,925 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the given operators, with the aim of improving the downstream model's performance for predicting whether a person receives credit.

1. \<checking_duration_ratio\>\<divide\>\<checking_status\>\<duration\>\<Ratio_of_checking_status_to_duration_provides_potential_insight_on_financial_behavior\>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the ratio of the checking account status to the loan duration. If the ratio is high, it might indicate a greater financial strain or risk, impacting creditworthiness.

2. \<employment_savings_interaction\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<savings_status\>\<Interaction_between_employment_and_savings_status_could_indicate_financial_stability\>
   - Reasoning: Cross-interacting these features can highlight patterns between employment length and savings. For instance, longer employment with positive savings could be a strong indicator of creditworthiness.

3. \<age_log_transformed\>\<log\>\<age\>\<Log_transformation_on_age_to_reduce_skewness_in_distribution\>
   - Reasoning: Applying a log transformation to the age feature can help reduce skewness and highlight differences in age more effectively, potentially capturing different credit-seeking behaviors across age groups.

2025-11-07 22:26:59,754 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration>
2. <employment_duration_log><log><employment><Log_transformed_employment_duration>
3. <age_employment_interaction><multiply><age><employment><Interaction_between_age_and_employment_duration>

Explanation:

1. <credit_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration>: This feature aims to capture the proportion of the credit amount to the duration. A high ratio might suggest that the credit amount is large relative to the duration, which could indicate a riskier profile.

2. <employment_duration_log><log><employment><Log_transformed_employment_duration>: Applying a log transformation to the employment duration can help normalize the distribution and reduce the impact of extreme values. This can lead to improved predictive power, especially if the original distribution is skewed.

3. <age_employment_interaction><multiply><age><employment><Interaction_between_age_and_employment_duration>: The interaction between age and employment duration can provide insights into the stability and maturity of the applicant's employment. This feature might help distinguish between experienced individuals with long employment histories versus younger applicants with shorter employment durations.

   *Reasoning*: By creating a feature that represents the average installment commitment for each checking status category, we can capture patterns or trends within each category, improving the model's ability to predict creditworthiness based on this interaction.

2. \<personal_status_encoded\>label_encode\<personal_status\>\<encoded_personal_status_values\>  
   *Reasoning*: Encoding categorical features like personal status can allow numerical models to interpret this personal characteristic's influence on credit decisions. This additional numeric representation can be directly used by machine learning algorithms that require numeric input.

3. \<employment_duration_ratio\>divide\<duration\>\<employment\>\<ratio_of_duration_to_employment_length\>  
   *Reasoning*: By examining the ratio of loan duration to employment length, we create a feature that may highlight potential financial risk or creditworthiness, indicating whether an individual has a stable employment record and how it matches their loan duration, potentially improving credit risk predictions.
