You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. It indicates the account balance range or absence of an account, serving as a primary indicator of liquidity and financial stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit arrangement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the loan funds. The categories include specific goals such as 'business', 'education', 'radio/tv' (likely for appliances/electronics), 'retraining', and others, which indicate the borrower's primary financial objective for the credit.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the level of financial reserves and is categorized as: no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, or greater than or equal to 1000 DM. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, including the new loan being considered (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as 'male single', 'female div/dep/mar', and other combinations of marital/relationship status and gender (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants or guarantors, which can influence risk assessment by sharing liability (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability of residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of valuable property or collateral offered by the applicant, which can influence credit risk assessment. Possible values include: 'real estate', 'building society savings agreement/life insurance', 'car or other vehicle', 'no known property', or 'unknown/no property'. (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free. This feature reflects financial stability and long-term financial commitments. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts or loans the applicant currently holds open at this same bank, including the one being applied for if approved. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current level of indebtedness to this specific financial institution. (numerical)
- job: Employment occupation category of the applicant, indicating skill level and employment sector (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents or individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support, such as children or other relatives (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no'. This feature reflects immigration status, which may be associated with different employment stability, residency rights, or lending risk profiles. (categorical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature created by combining the categories from the 'checking_status' and 'credit_history' features into a single cross-tabulated representation, which has then been converted into a numeric label through encoding. This captures interaction effects between a client's account balance status and their historical credit repayment behavior. (numerical)
- duration_credit_amount_multiply_log: The natural logarithm of the product of the loan duration in months and the credit amount in Deutsche Marks. This engineered feature captures the combined logarithmic scale of total credit exposure over time. (numerical)
- savings_status_residence_since_concat_label_encode: (numerical) A label-encoded numerical representation derived from first concatenating the categorical values of the original 'savings_status' and 'residence_since' features into a single combined category, and then converting that new categorical combination into a unique integer code.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: (numerical) A derived numerical feature representing the combined interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their credit history, created through a cross-label encoding process. This single value captures complex, non-linear relationships between these two categorical financial indicators, which may be more predictive than considering each feature independently.
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the loan's agreed repayment period (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, denoted in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_plus_log: The natural logarithm of the sum of the credit amount (in Deutsche Marks) and the loan duration (in months). This feature transforms the raw sum to reduce skewness and compress scale, making the combined impact of loan size and term length more suitable for linear modeling. (numerical)
- savings_status_residence_since_concat_label_encode: (numerical) A composite numerical feature created by first concatenating the categorical values of 'savings_status' and 'residence_since' into a single string, and then applying label encoding to this new combined category. It represents the interaction between a client's savings account status and the duration of their residence, transformed into a unique integer code for model processing.
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit conduct, including repayment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- credit_history_employment_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature representing the combined categorical encoding of the applicant's prior credit history and their current employment status. This engineered cross-feature captures potential interactions between these two critical risk factors, where a higher or lower value indicates a specific historical and employment profile that may influence creditworthiness. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical variable with common tiers indicating the approximate balance: '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', and '>=1000 DM'. (categorical)
- age_residence_since_ratio: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to their duration of residence at the current address, calculated as age divided by residence_since. This numerical feature may indicate stability, with higher values suggesting the applicant is older relative to their time at the current residence. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most significant property or asset owned by the applicant, used as collateral or as an indicator of financial stability (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex, categorized into groups such as male single, female divorced/separated/married, male married/widowed, or female single (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit lines or loans the applicant currently has open with this bank, including the one being applied for if already counted. This numerical value represents the applicant's current level of indebtedness to this specific financial institution. (numerical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, which refers to individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support, such as children or other relatives (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical: 'yes', 'no'). In some datasets, 'none' may be used as a category equivalent to 'no'.
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature specifies whether there are co-applicants, guarantors, or if no other parties are involved, which influences the lender's risk assessment by determining secondary sources for repayment obligation. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential occupancy (categorical: 'rent', 'own', or 'for free')
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or stores, which may indicate existing debt obligations and repayment burden (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, which is a categorical variable used to assess potential employment stability and residency status in the credit evaluation process (categorical)

2025-12-19 16:38:26,289 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature representing the combined categorical encoding of the applicant's checking account status and their historical credit repayment behavior, created through a cross-label encoding process that captures interaction effects between these two fundamental financial attributes. (numerical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. This feature indicates the balance level and can signify financial stability. Categories typically represent ranges such as negative balance ('<0'), low positive balance ('0<=X<200'), or well-funded account ('>=200'), along with special cases like 'no checking account'. (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_plus_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the sum of the original credit amount (in Deutsche Marks) and the loan duration (in months). This transformation compresses the scale of large combined values, making the feature's distribution more symmetrical and potentially improving its linear relationship with the target variable.
- savings_status_residence_since_concat_label_encode: A numerical feature created by first concatenating the categorical values of 'savings_status' and 'residence_since', and then applying a label encoding scheme to transform this combined categorical string into a unique integer code. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, indicating whether previous credit obligations were fulfilled as agreed, delayed, or defaulted (categorical)
- credit_history_employment_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature representing the combined categorical interaction between an applicant's credit history and their employment status. It is derived from a label encoding process that assigns a unique integer to each distinct pairing of the two original categorical variables, capturing potential joint effects on credit risk. (numerical)
- savings_status: Current balance level of the individual's savings account and bonds, denominated in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the financial safety buffer available to the applicant. (categorical)
- age_residence_since_ratio: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to the number of years they have resided at their current address, calculated as age divided by residence_since. This numerical feature may indicate stability, with higher values suggesting the applicant is older relative to their time at the current residence. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the primary asset or collateral offered by the applicant to secure the credit, such as real estate, a car, or a life insurance policy (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical). A lower value indicates higher residential mobility, while a higher value suggests greater stability.
- **personal_status**: Personal status and sex of the applicant, combining marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced/separated) and gender (male, female) into a single categorical variable. Common categories include 'male single', 'female div/dep/mar' (female divorced/separated/married), 'male mar/wid' (male married/widowed), and 'male div/sep' (male divorced/separated). (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including the one being applied for if already counted. This numerical value represents the applicant's current active credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, specifically individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support, such as children or other reliant family members (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are other debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature identifies if additional parties are obligated for repayment, which can influence risk assessment by considering shared financial responsibility. Possible values include: 'none' for no other parties, 'guarantor' for someone who guarantees the loan, and 'co-applicant' for a joint applicant. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their living arrangement and potential financial stability (categorical: 'rent', 'own', 'for free')
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a continuous numerical feature representing the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans or credit arrangements with banks or retail stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess potential immigration status-related risk factors in credit evaluation (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the applicant's length of residence at the current address in years, representing the relative commitment length of the loan compared to residential stability. (numerical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_plus: A derived numerical feature representing the sum of the number of existing credits at this bank and the number of dependents the applicant supports. It provides a combined measure of the applicant's current credit obligations and financial dependents. (numerical)
- savings_status_property_magnitude_cross_label_encode: (numerical) A label-encoded categorical feature representing the unique combination of a client's savings account status and the magnitude of their property. This engineered feature captures the interaction between two financial stability indicators, where each distinct pair of original categories is mapped to a distinct integer.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration_age_residence_since_ratio_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the loan duration (in months) and the product of the applicant's age and their time at the current residence. This feature transforms a multiplicative relationship into an additive scale, helping to normalize the distribution and capture non-linear interactions between these three temporal characteristics. (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) currency brackets. Categories represent ranges such as negative balances, low positive balances, or no checking account. (categorical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature representing the combined categorical encoding of two original variables: the applicant's checking account status and their credit history. This value is derived from a cross-label encoding process that creates a single interaction term, capturing non-linear relationships and interdependencies between these two fundamental financial reliability indicators. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male married or widowed, female divorced/separated/married, and female single (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time at their current residence (in years), calculated as duration divided by residence_since. This engineered feature may highlight the relative stability of the applicant's living situation compared to the loan commitment period. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability and local establishment (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_plus_log: The natural logarithm of the sum of the credit amount and the loan duration. This transformation reduces skewness and scales the combined financial commitment and time dimension of the loan. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and any outstanding credit issues (categorical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_plus: A derived numerical feature representing the sum of the number of existing credits at this bank and the number of dependents in the applicant's care. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- age_residence_since_ratio: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to their duration of residence at the current address in years. This numerical feature represents life stage stability, where a higher value indicates the applicant is older relative to how long they have lived at their current residence. (numerical)
- credit_history_employment_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature engineered by performing a cross-label encoding on the combination of an applicant's credit history and their employment status. This encoding creates a single categorical identifier that captures the interaction between these two important risk factors, which is then converted to a numerical representation for model input. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific financial institution, including both active and open accounts (numerical integer)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- num_dependents: The total count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide ongoing support and maintenance (numerical integer).

- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as duration divided by residence_since. This numerical feature may indicate the applicant's stability relative to the loan term, with higher values suggesting a longer loan commitment compared to their time at a single address. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence address (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_plus_log: The natural logarithm of the sum of the credit amount requested and the duration of the loan in months. This transformation compresses the scale of large combined values and can help linearize relationships with the target variable. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized into groups such as no credits/all paid, delayed previously, critical/other existing credit, existing credits paid duly, and all credits at this bank paid duly (categorical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_plus: A numerical feature created by summing the number of existing credits at this bank and the number of dependents in the applicant's care. It represents a combined indicator of the applicant's current credit commitments and family financial responsibilities. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a continuous numerical variable that represents the principal sum. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_ratio: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to the number of years they have resided at their current address, calculated as age divided by residence_since. This numerical feature may indicate stability, with higher values suggesting either older age relative to residence duration or shorter tenancy at the current location. (numerical)
- credit_history_employment_cross_label_encode: A numerically encoded feature representing the combined interaction between an applicant's credit history and their current employment status. This label encoding captures specific, high-level risk patterns that emerge from the intersection of these two critical financial stability indicators. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of currently active loans or credit lines the applicant holds at this specific bank, which serves as an indicator of the applicant's current debt obligations and credit exposure within the institution (numerical integer)
- housing: Type of housing accommodation for the applicant, which can be 'rent', 'own', or 'for free' (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' that may influence credit risk assessment based on employment stability and residency status (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration_age_residence_since_ratio_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the loan duration (in months) and the product of the applicant's age and the duration of their residence at the current address. This feature transforms a multiplicative interaction term to a linear scale, helping to normalize its distribution and capture complex, non-linear relationships between time-based applicant stability factors. (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. It indicates the account balance level and is a key risk indicator. (categorical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature created by performing a cross-label encoding on the combination of two original categorical variables: 'checking_status' and 'credit_history'. This encoding represents a specific, learned interaction between a client's account status and their historical credit repayment behavior, with higher values indicating a more complex or risk-associated combination. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/divorced, female divorced/separated/married, or female single (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as duration divided by residence_since. This feature may indicate the applicant's financial commitment relative to residential stability. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_plus_log: The natural logarithm of the sum of the requested credit amount and the loan duration in months. This transformation compresses the scale of large combined values and may help linearize relationships with the target variable. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as 'existing paid' for loans repaid duly, 'critical/other existing credit' for delayed payments or problematic existing credits, or other classifications indicating the reliability of the borrower's previous credit obligations (categorical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_plus: A numerical feature created by summing the number of existing credits at this bank and the number of dependents in the applicant's care. It represents a combined indicator of the applicant's current credit obligations and family financial responsibilities. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The monetary value of the credit requested or granted to the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- age_residence_since_ratio: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to their duration of residence at the current address in years. This numerical feature may indicate stability, with higher values suggesting the applicant is older relative to their time at their residence. (numerical)
- credit_history_employment_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature representing the combined categorical encoding of an applicant's credit history and current employment status. This cross-feature captures interaction effects between these two critical risk factors, where specific pairings may influence creditworthiness more than either attribute alone. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of currently active loans or credit lines the applicant holds at this specific bank, including the one being applied for if already counted. This numerical value represents the applicant's current debt obligations with the institution. (numerical)
- housing: Type of housing accommodation occupied by the applicant, which may indicate financial stability and living expenses. Categories include renting, owning a home, or living for free. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, specifically people for whom the applicant is legally liable to provide maintenance and financial support, such as children or other relatives (numerical)

Features:
- duration_age_residence_since_ratio_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the loan duration (in months) and the product of the applicant's age and their time at the current residence. This engineered feature captures the complex, non-linear relationship between the loan term, the applicant's life stage, and residential stability. (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account with the bank, expressed in categorical tiers based on the account balance in Deutsche Mark (DM). The categories are: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '0<=X<200' (low balance), and other possible tiers (like '>=200' or '... < 0') representing higher balances or overdrawn accounts. This feature is critical for assessing the applicant's liquidity and financial stability. (categorical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature representing the combined categorical encoding of the applicant's checking account status and their historical credit repayment behavior. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as 'male single', 'female div/dep/mar' (female divorced/separated/married), and other marital-gender combinations (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as duration divided by residence_since. This numerical feature may indicate stability, with higher values suggesting a relatively longer commitment to a loan compared to time at the current address. (numerical)
- residence_since: The duration, in years, that the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_plus_log: The natural logarithm of the sum of the requested credit amount and the loan duration in months. This transformation compresses the scale of large combined values, making the distribution more symmetric and potentially improving model stability. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_plus: The sum of the number of existing credits at this bank and the number of dependents in the applicant's care. This is a derived numerical feature that combines two aspects of an applicant's financial obligations. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- age_residence_since_ratio: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to their duration of residence at the current address in years. This numerical feature may indicate stability, with higher values suggesting the applicant is older relative to their time at their residence, while lower values suggest a shorter residency relative to age. (numerical)
- credit_history_employment_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature created by performing a cross-label encoding on the combination of an applicant's credit history and their current employment status. This encoding represents a unique identifier for each distinct pairing of those two categorical attributes. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific banking institution (numerical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential accommodation (e.g., rent, own, or for free) (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature with values 'yes' or 'no' used to assess employment stability and residency status (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, specifically the count of individuals (such as children or other relatives) for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical integer).

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration_age_residence_since_ratio_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the loan duration in months and the customer's age, further divided by the duration of their residence at the current address. This engineered feature captures the complex, non-linear interaction between the loan term, the applicant's life stage, and residential stability. (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no checking' indicates no account, '<0' denotes a negative balance, '0<=X<200' represents a low positive balance, and '>=200' signifies a substantial positive balance. (categorical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature derived from the cross-label encoding of two categorical variables: the applicant's checking account status and their credit history. This encoding combines the two original categories into a single, unique numerical identifier for each possible combination, capturing potential interaction effects between these two financial indicators. (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/divorced, female divorced/separated/married, or female single (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as a continuous numerical value. This feature may indicate stability, as a lower ratio suggests longer residence relative to loan term, while a higher ratio suggests a shorter residency compared to the commitment period. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_plus_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the sum of the credit amount and the loan duration, used to transform and scale this combined financial commitment metric for modeling.
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and any previous delinquencies (categorical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_plus: A numerical feature created by adding the number of existing credits at this bank to the number of dependents the applicant supports. It represents a combined indicator of the applicant's current credit burden and family responsibilities. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks for this dataset (numerical)
- age_residence_since_ratio: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to the number of years they have resided at their current address. This numerical feature may indicate stability, with higher values suggesting the applicant is older relative to their tenure at their residence. (numerical)
- credit_history_employment_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature created by combining and label encoding the categorical variables for credit history and employment status. Each unique combination of the two original features is assigned a distinct integer code. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of all current credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) the applicant holds at this specific bank, not including the new credit being applied for (numerical)
- housing: Type of housing accommodation the applicant currently resides in, including categories such as renting, home ownership, or other living arrangements (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, specifically the count of individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
