Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). This feature indicates liquidity and financial stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit arrangement (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: (numerical) The ratio of the applicant's age in years to the duration of the requested credit in months. This feature is calculated by dividing age by duration and may serve as a normalized measure of the loan's term relative to the applicant's life stage, with lower values indicating a longer loan relative to age.
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges in years: less than 1 year, 1 to under 4 years, 4 to under 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has registered a telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with the possible values 'yes' (telephone is registered to the applicant), 'no' (applicant does not have a telephone), or 'none' (no telephone number was provided or applicable).
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence and type of other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or retail stores. A 'none' value signifies no other installment debt, while values like 'bank' or 'stores' specify the type of creditor.

- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer).
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific banking institution. This includes all active credit relationships, such as personal loans, car loans, overdrafts, and credit cards, and is a direct measure of the applicant's current debt obligations to the bank. (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the individual's checking account, categorized as '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or 'no checking' (no account). (categorical)
- duration: Length of the loan or credit arrangement in months. (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to the loan duration, calculated as age divided by duration. (numerical)
- employment: Length of current employment, categorized as '1<=X<4' (1 to under 4 years) or '>=7' (7 years or more). (categorical)
- own_telephone: Telephone ownership status, with 'none' indicating no telephone is registered. (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of other payment plans, with 'none' indicating no other installment plans exist. (categorical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past credit behavior, with 'existing paid' indicating all existing credits are properly paid. (categorical)

- installment_commitment: Number of installment commitments for the current loan or credit, with '4' as a specific count. (numerical)
- existing_credits: Number of existing credits or loans held at this bank, with '1' as a specific count. (numerical)
- num_dependents: Number of people, typically children or relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support. (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Immigration status regarding work, with 'yes' indicating the applicant is a foreign worker. (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: The average credit amount for applicants within the same savings_status category, used as an aggregated feature. (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature with two possible states: 'yes' or 'no'. This is a legal and residency status that may influence credit risk assessment due to factors like job stability, length of residence, or differing financial histories. (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The average credit amount for all applicants who share the same savings_status category. This engineered feature aggregates historical data by grouping applicants based on their savings_status (e.g., "<100", "500<=X<1000") and then calculating the mean credit_amount for each group. It provides a contextual benchmark indicating the typical loan size associated with a given level of savings.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no checking' indicates no account, '<0' denotes a negative balance, '0<=X<200' represents a low positive balance, and '>=200' signifies a high minimum balance. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the loan in months (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to the loan duration in months, calculated as age divided by duration. This numerical feature represents the relative maturity or life stage of the applicant per month of the loan commitment. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized into ranges of years: less than 1 year, 1 to under 4 years, 4 to under 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant possesses a telephone line registered in their name, which can serve as a point of contact and a potential indicator of stability (categorical: 'yes', 'no', or 'none' for no telephone registered)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence and type of other concurrent installment payment plans, such as those with banks or retail stores, that the applicant is committed to (categorical: 'none', 'bank', 'stores')
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including payment punctuality and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of third-party support for the credit application, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors. Categories include 'none' for no additional parties, 'guarantor' for an individual providing a guarantee, and 'co applicant' for a joint applicant. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the total value of the applicant's liquid savings and bond holdings into ordinal tiers, reflecting financial reserves and stability. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for existing loans, including the proposed new loan. This is a critical indicator of debt burden and repayment capacity. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts or loans currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including any active installment plans or revolving credits (numerical, integer)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the loan in months (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: Ratio of the applicant's age to the loan duration, calculated as age divided by duration (numerical)
- employment: Length of the applicant's current employment, categorized by time ranges (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant possesses a telephone, with possible values being 'yes' or 'none' (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Existence of other payment plans, such as from banks, stores, or none (categorical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past credit behavior, including categories like 'delayed previously', 'existing paid', or 'critical/other existing credit' (categorical)
- other_parties: Presence of other parties, such as guarantors or co-applicants, with 'none' indicating no other parties involved (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account, categorized by balance ranges or 'no known savings' (categorical)
- installment_commitment: Number of installment commitments or existing loans the applicant is responsible for (numerical)
- existing_credits: Count of existing credit lines or loans held by the applicant at this bank (numerical)
- num_dependents: Total number of dependents, including children or other individuals for whom the applicant is financially responsible (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: Mean credit amount grouped by savings status, representing the average loan amount for each savings category (numerical)
- checking_status_duration_concat_label_encode: Encoded label derived from concatenating checking status and duration categories, used for categorical representation (numerical)
- savings_status_existing_credits_groupbythenmean: Mean number of existing credits grouped by savings status, indicating the average credit lines per savings category (numerical)
- age_duration_divide_sqrt: Square root of the age-to-duration ratio, providing a transformed measure of the relationship between age and loan term (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The mean credit amount for all individuals in the dataset who share the same savings_status category as this applicant. This engineered feature represents the average historical loan size for applicants with a similar level of savings, providing context for whether this applicant's requested credit amount is typical or atypical for their savings group.
- checking_status_duration_concat_label_encode: (numerical) A label-encoded categorical feature representing the unique combination of the applicant's checking account status and the loan duration. This encoding is derived by first concatenating the two original feature values into a single string and then assigning a distinct integer to each unique combination observed in the dataset.
- savings_status_existing_credits_groupbythenmean: The average number of existing credits at other banks for all applicants within the same savings status category. This engineered feature aggregates historical data to summarize the typical credit burden associated with a given level of personal savings. (numerical)
- age_duration_divide_sqrt: The square root of the ratio between the applicant's age and the loan duration, providing a transformed measure that reduces skewness and emphasizes proportional relationships for modeling. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) currency units. This categorical feature indicates the balance level or account condition, with common values including 'no checking' (no account), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '<0' (negative balance/overdraft), and '>=200' (substantial balance), which serves as a key indicator of the applicant's short-term financial liquidity and stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to the duration of the requested loan in months. This numerical feature captures the applicant's life stage relative to the loan's term, where a higher value may indicate an older applicant or a very short-term loan, potentially influencing risk assessment. (numerical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges: less than 1 year, between 1 and 4 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical: 'yes', 'no')
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence and type of other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds, such as those with banks or stores, which may influence their debt burden and repayment risk (categorical: 'none', 'bank', 'stores')
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants or guarantors, who are obligated to repay the loan if the primary borrower defaults. This categorical feature includes values like 'none', 'co applicant', and 'guarantor', reflecting the level of external credit support for the application. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the total monetary value held in savings instruments, with common categories including no savings, low savings (e.g., <100 DM), moderate savings (e.g., 100-500 DM), and substantial savings (e.g., >=1000 DM). (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to repaying existing installment debts, such as loans for cars or appliances, expressed as an integer value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). A higher value indicates a greater portion of income is already obligated to debt repayment. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of all active credit lines or loans currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including installment loans, revolving credit, and overdrafts (numerical integer)
- num_dependents: The count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance and support (numerical integer).
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The average credit amount for all applicants who share the same savings_status category. This engineered feature represents the mean loan amount historically associated with a given savings account tier, providing context about typical credit levels for that financial profile.
- checking_status_duration_concat_label_encode: A numerical feature engineered by first concatenating the categorical 'checking_status' with the numerical 'duration' (likely converted to string), and then applying a label encoding transformation to the resulting combined categories. This process creates a single numerical representation that captures the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and the loan duration. (numerical)
- savings_status_existing_credits_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The mean number of existing credits for all applicants within the same savings_status category, calculated by first grouping the dataset by the 'savings_status' feature and then computing the average of the 'existing_credits' values for each group. This engineered feature represents the typical credit load for individuals with a similar level of savings.
- age_duration_divide_sqrt: The square root of the ratio between the applicant's age and the duration of the requested credit in months. This engineered feature non-linearly combines two fundamental temporal attributes, potentially capturing more complex life-stage and repayment-burden interactions than the raw ratio alone.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific balance ranges: 'no checking account', 'balance < 0 DM' (overdrawn), '0 <= balance < 200 DM', or 'balance >= 200 DM'. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the loan in months (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: (numerical) The ratio of the applicant's age to the duration of the requested loan, calculated as age divided by duration. This engineered feature may help capture the relative financial burden or repayment capacity over the applicant's lifetime.
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical: 'none' for no telephone, 'yes' for having a telephone)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's other concurrent installment plans with banks or stores, which may indicate existing financial commitments and credit behavior (categorical: 'none', 'bank', 'stores')
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past repayment behavior with existing credits, categorized by payment timeliness and completeness (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of other parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This categorical feature indicates the level of savings and includes categories such as no known savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and greater than or equal to 1000 DM. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The installment rate expressed as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income, representing the portion of income committed to repaying existing and requested credit installments (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including the one being applied for if already active. This numerical value reflects the applicant's current debt obligations and credit exposure within this specific financial institution. (numerical)
- num_dependents: The total count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance and support. This numerical feature reflects the applicant's financial obligations outside of the credit being applied for. (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- **savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean**: (numerical) The average credit amount for all applicants in the dataset who share the same savings_status category. This engineered feature aggregates historical data to summarize the typical credit level associated with each savings group, providing contextual information about an applicant's financial peer group.
- checking_status_duration_concat_label_encode: A numerical feature created by first concatenating the categorical 'checking_status' and the numerical 'duration' (in months) into a single string, and then applying a label encoding transformation to that combined string. This process converts each unique combination into a distinct integer, capturing potential interaction effects between an applicant's checking account status and the loan duration in a single encoded value. (numerical)
- savings_status_existing_credits_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The mean number of existing credits for individuals within the same savings status category, calculated by first grouping the dataset by the 'savings_status' feature and then computing the average of the 'existing_credits' feature for each group. This engineered feature represents the typical credit burden associated with a given level of savings.
- age_duration_divide_sqrt: The square root of the ratio between the applicant's age and the loan duration in months. This transformation reduces the skew of the original ratio and may better represent non-linear relationships in the data. (numerical)

- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence and status of other concurrent installment plans or credit arrangements with banks or stores, which may influence the applicant's current debt burden and repayment risk (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, including timeliness and fulfillment of previous credit obligations (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of other parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include '<100' (less than 100 DM), '100<=X<500' (between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000' (between 500 and 999 DM), '>=1000' (1000 DM or more), and 'no known savings' (no savings account or bonds). (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including loans and credit lines, which serves as an indicator of the applicant's current debt obligations and relationship depth with the institution (numerical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, such as children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The mean credit amount for all applicants within the same savings_status category, used as an aggregated feature to represent the typical credit level associated with that savings group.
- checking_status_duration_concat_label_encode: A numerical label encoding that uniquely identifies each combined category of the applicant's checking account status and the loan duration. It is generated by first concatenating the two original categorical features into a single composite category and then applying a label encoding transformation to assign a distinct integer to each unique combination. (numerical)
- savings_status_existing_credits_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The average number of existing credits held by other applicants who share the same savings_status category. This engineered feature represents the historical relationship between a categorical savings level and the typical number of concurrent loans, providing a contextual benchmark for an applicant's credit burden.
- age_duration_divide_sqrt: (numerical) The square root of the ratio between the applicant's age and the duration of the loan in months. This feature transforms the age-to-duration proportion to mitigate the influence of extreme values and potentially better capture non-linear relationships in the data.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no checking account', '<0 DM' (negative balance), '0<=X<200 DM' (low positive balance), and '>=200 DM' (high positive balance). This feature indicates the applicant's short-term financial liquidity and stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age in years to the duration of the requested credit in months. This numerical feature is calculated as (age / duration) and may indicate the applicant's life stage relative to the loan term, with higher values suggesting an older applicant or a shorter-term loan. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status categorized by duration ranges, specifically indicating periods of unemployment or employment lasting less than 1 year, between 1 and 4 years, between 4 and 7 years, or 7 years and above. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's other concurrent installment plans with banks or retail stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with the following possible levels: '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', and 'unknown/no savings account'. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer/numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts or loans currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including both active and settled liabilities, which serves as a numerical indicator of the applicant's existing debt burden and relationship depth with the institution (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the individual's checking account, categorized into specific monetary ranges or 'no checking' (categorical)
- duration: Length of the loan or credit arrangement in months (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: Ratio calculated by dividing the applicant's age by the loan duration (numerical)
- employment: Length of current employment, categorized into specific time ranges (categorical)
- own_telephone: Telephone ownership status, indicating if the applicant has a telephone in their name (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Existence of other payment plans, such as those with banks or stores (categorical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past credit behavior, including payment delays, existing credits, or no prior credit (categorical)
- other_parties: Presence of other parties, such as guarantors, co-applicants, or none (categorical)
- savings_status: Level of savings or bonds, categorized into specific monetary ranges (categorical)
- installment_commitment: Number of installment commitments or loans the applicant is currently liable for (numerical)
- existing_credits: Count of existing credits or loans held at this bank (numerical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, specifically people for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicator of whether the applicant is a foreign worker (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: Mean credit amount aggregated by savings status categories, used for feature engineering (numerical)
- checking_status_duration_concat_label_encode: Encoded categorical feature created by concatenating checking status and duration, then label encoded (numerical)
- savings_status_existing_credits_groupbythenmean: Mean number of existing credits aggregated by savings status categories, used for feature engineering (numerical)
- age_duration_divide_sqrt: Square root of the age-to-duration ratio, used as a transformed feature for modeling (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The average credit amount for all applicants who share the same savings_status category. This engineered feature represents the mean credit amount conditioned on the applicant's savings status, providing a contextual benchmark for the individual's requested credit relative to their peer group.
- checking_status_duration_concat_label_encode: (numerical) A label-encoded numerical representation derived from the concatenation of the 'checking_status' and 'duration' features. This encoding captures the combined categorical relationship between an applicant's account status and the loan duration as a single ordinal value.
- savings_status_existing_credits_groupbythenmean: The average number of existing credits held by applicants within the same savings status category. This engineered feature groups applicants by their savings status (e.g., "<100", "500<=X<1000") and calculates the mean of the 'existing_credits' for each group, providing a contextual benchmark for an applicant's credit load relative to peers with similar savings. (numerical)
- age_duration_divide_sqrt: The square root of the ratio between the applicant's age and the duration of the requested credit in months. This engineered feature non-linearly combines two fundamental temporal attributes, potentially capturing more complex life-stage and risk-exposure interactions than a simple ratio. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the account balance and history into discrete levels: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial positive balance). This feature is critical for assessing financial stability and liquidity. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan agreement or installment plan (numerical)
- age_duration_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to the loan duration, calculated as age divided by duration in months. This numerical feature represents the applicant's life stage relative to the loan's repayment period, where higher values indicate an older applicant or a shorter-term loan. (numerical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges of years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds with banks or stores, which may indicate existing financial commitments (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as: 'existing paid' (current credits paid duly), 'all paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits not paid duly or with critical history), 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayment), or 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid duly). (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This categorical feature reflects the level of external financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and greater than or equal to 1000 DM. This feature reflects the applicant's available liquid assets. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying existing installment debts, such as loans or hire-purchase agreements (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (such as loans or credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, which may influence the assessment of current debt burden and repayment capacity (numerical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, which refers to individuals (typically children or other relatives) for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical integer)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- savings_status_credit_amount_groupbythenmean: The mean credit amount for all applicants within the same savings_status category, used as an aggregated feature to represent the typical loan size associated with that savings level. (numerical)
- checking_status_duration_concat_label_encode: (numerical) A label-encoded categorical feature representing the unique combination of a client's checking account status and loan duration. This encoding is generated by first concatenating the two original categorical features into a single composite category and then assigning a distinct numerical identifier to each unique combination present in the dataset.
- **savings_status_existing_credits_groupbythenmean**: (numerical) The mean value of the `existing_credits` feature, calculated after grouping the dataset by the `savings_status` category. This engineered feature represents the average number of existing credits held by applicants within each specific savings status bracket, providing a normalized view of credit burden relative to savings behavior.
- age_duration_divide_sqrt: The square root of the ratio of the applicant's age to the loan duration. This derived feature non-linearly combines two fundamental characteristics, potentially capturing a normalized measure of the applicant's life stage relative to the loan's term. (numerical)
- savings_status_duration_groupbythenmean: (numerical) The average loan duration (in months) for all applicants within the same savings_status category, calculated from the training dataset. This engineered feature represents the typical duration associated with a given level of savings.
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature created by performing label encoding on the combined categorical interaction (cross) of an applicant's checking account status and their historical credit behavior. This engineered variable captures non-linear or interactive effects between these two fundamental financial indicators, which may be predictive of credit risk. (numerical)
