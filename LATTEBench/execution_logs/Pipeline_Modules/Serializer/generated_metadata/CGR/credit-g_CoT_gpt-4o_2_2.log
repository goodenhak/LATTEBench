You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Possible values indicate levels of financial liquidity, such as 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the credit loan or installment agreement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as: 'all paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits paid untimely or other critical issues), 'delayed previously' (past delays in credit repayments), 'existing paid' (existing credits duly paid so far), or 'no credits/all paid' (no prior credits or all paid duly). (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the loan funds, such as for a new car, radio/television, furniture/equipment, business, education, or domestic appliances. It is a categorical variable that indicates the primary goal of the credit application.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no known savings' (no verifiable savings), '<100 DM' (less than 100 DM), '100<=X<500 DM' (between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000 DM' (between 500 and 999 DM), and '>=1000 DM' (1000 DM or more). (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges of years: less than 1 year, 1 to under 4 years, 4 to under 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for this loan, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the relative burden of the loan payment on the borrower's available monthly funds. (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and sex of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/widowed, male divorced/separated, or female divorced/separated/married (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the loan, such as co-applicants or guarantors (categorical: 'none', 'guarantor', 'co-applicant')
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or type of the applicant's existing property that can be offered as collateral, categorized as real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, including those from banks or department stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential accommodation (categorical: rent, own, for free)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value represents the applicant's current active credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Current occupation category of the applicant, indicating employment type and skill level (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This feature serves as a proxy for stability and verifiability. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, specifically if they are not a citizen of the country where the credit is being applied for (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the loan duration in months. This derived feature helps normalize the scale of the credit per month and can reveal non-linear relationships between credit size, repayment period, and risk. (numerical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It is created by concatenating the raw string values of the two original features with an underscore, capturing potential non-linear relationships that may be more predictive of credit risk than either feature alone.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range or absence of an account: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, indicating reliability in repaying debts (categorical)
- **purpose**: Purpose of the credit, indicating the intended use of the requested loan funds. This is a categorical feature with values such as 'radio/tv' (for electronics/appliances), 'education', 'furniture/equipment', 'car', 'business', 'domestic appliances', 'repairs', 'vacation', 'retraining', or 'other'. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM), representing the principal loan sum before interest (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: no savings ('<100 DM'), low savings ('100 <= ... < 500 DM'), moderate savings ('500 <= ... < 1000 DM'), substantial savings ('>=1000 DM'), or unknown/not applicable ('no known savings'). (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges: unemployed (<1 year), 1<=X<4 years, 4<=X<7 years, or >=7 years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer). This represents the current burden of regular debt payments separate from the new loan being considered.
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male married/widowed, female divorced/separated/married, and female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical: 'none', 'guarantor', 'co-applicant')
- residence_since: Duration in years the applicant has lived at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: Categorization of the applicant's most valuable owned property, used as collateral (e.g., real estate, car, life insurance, or no known property) (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, such as those with banks or department stores, which may affect the applicant's debt burden and repayment risk (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their primary living arrangement (e.g., rent, own, for free) (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including loans and credit lines. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current active credit relationship volume with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Current employment type or occupational category (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This feature serves as a proxy for stability, contactability, and personal infrastructure. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess residency status and potential employment stability (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio of the requested credit amount to the loan duration in months. This engineered feature helps normalize the relationship between the loan size and its repayment term, often revealing a more linear association with risk than the raw values alone. (numerical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: A categorical feature representing the combined interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It is created by concatenating the two original feature values with an underscore, capturing potential non-linear or synergistic effects that the individual statuses may have on credit risk. (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) and categorized as one of the following: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '>=200' (high positive balance), or '<0' (negative balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: Detailed record of the applicant's past credit behavior and repayment performance, categorized as: 'no credits/all paid' (no prior credits or all paid duly), 'existing paid' (all existing credits paid back duly), 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayment), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits with critical account status or other issues), or 'all paid' (all credits at this bank paid back duly) (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the loan funds, such as for a new car, radio/television, business, or other defined categories. It is a critical factor in risk assessment, as different purposes are associated with varying levels of financial stability and default probability.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, denominated in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum the individual seeks to borrow. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the total liquid savings and bond holdings into predefined tiers, indicating the applicant's financial buffer. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment in years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex, indicating marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced/separated) combined with gender (male, female), treated as a composite categorical variable (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of any co-applicants, guarantors, or other parties with shared liability for the credit. Categories are: none (no other debtors or guarantors), co applicant (an additional applicant with joint income or liability), or guarantor (a third party who guarantees repayment). (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence. A longer duration may indicate higher stability. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset, used as collateral or an indicator of financial stability (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has, categorized as those from banks, stores, or none (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total number of credit accounts or loans the applicant currently holds at this same bank, including the one being applied for if already counted. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and employment type (e.g., unskilled resident, skilled, high qualif/self emp/mgmt) (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'. This is a categorical feature that may reflect institutional lending policies, perceived employment stability, or residency status, which can influence credit risk assessment. (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio of the requested credit amount to the loan duration in months. This engineered feature captures the non-linear relationship between the principal loan size and its repayment timeline, where higher values indicate a larger loan amount relative to a shorter term. (numerical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It captures potential risk patterns that may not be evident when considering each feature in isolation, such as the conjunction of a low checking balance and low savings.

- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible values: 'none' for no telephone, or 'yes' for having a telephone. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess potential stability, residency status, and perceived risk profile in the lending decision (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: (numerical) The base-10 logarithm of the ratio between the credit amount and the loan duration. This engineered feature normalizes the credit amount by the repayment period, helping to represent the relative burden or size of each installment in a scale-invariant manner. A higher value indicates a larger loan amount relative to a shorter duration.
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. Each value is a concatenation of the two individual feature states (e.g., '<0_<100'), capturing potential risk patterns that may not be apparent when the two features are considered independently.

- duration: Duration of the credit in months. (numerical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past credit history, including categories like 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', or 'critical/other existing credit'. (categorical)
- purpose: Intended use of the credit, such as 'radio/tv', 'business', or 'other'. (categorical)
- credit_amount: Amount of credit requested in the local currency. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account, categorized into ranges like '<100', '100<=X<500', etc. (categorical)
- employment: Length of current employment, categorized into ranges such as '<1', '1<=X<4', or '4<=X<7' years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: Installment rate as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, e.g., 'male single' or 'female div/dep/mar'. (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account with the bank, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. These categories indicate the account balance range and include: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: Credit history of the applicant, categorized based on their past repayment behavior and existing credit relationships (categorical)
- name: purpose  
  desc: The intended use of the requested credit, categorized into specific economic or personal domains such as business, radio/television, education, furniture/equipment, new or used car, domestic appliances, repairs, vacation, retraining, or other purposes. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the approximate balance range, which serves as a proxy for financial stability and liquidity. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges of years: less than 1 year, 1 to under 4 years, 4 to under 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, representing ongoing financial obligations (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/divorced, female single, or female married/divorced/separated (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional obligors or guarantors for the credit application, categorized as: 'none' for no other parties, 'guarantor' for a co-signer, or 'co-applicant' for a joint applicant. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, indicating stability and local ties (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The classification of the most valuable asset or collateral provided by the applicant, which serves as a risk mitigation factor for the credit institution (categorical)

- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio of the credit amount to the loan duration. This feature transforms the raw credit-amount-to-duration ratio to mitigate the influence of extreme values and better capture the scale of the financial commitment relative to the repayment period. A higher value indicates a larger credit amount for a given duration or a shorter duration for a given amount.
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. Each value is a concatenation of the two original statuses (e.g., "<0_<100" or "no checking_<100"), capturing potential risk patterns that may not be evident when considering the two features independently.

- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years of service. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to repay, expressed as a count (integer). This represents the total concurrent installment-based financial obligations, such as car loans or furniture payments, excluding mortgages or revolving credit. A higher count indicates a greater existing debt burden and monthly fixed payment obligations (numerical).
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as 'male single', 'male married/divorced', 'female divorced/separated/married', and 'female single' (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical)
