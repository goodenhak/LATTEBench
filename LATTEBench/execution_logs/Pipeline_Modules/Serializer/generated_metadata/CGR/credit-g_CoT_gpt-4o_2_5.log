Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) currency bands. It indicates the account balance level and is a critical indicator of financial liquidity and stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from origination to the scheduled final payment (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as 'existing paid' (all prior credits duly repaid), 'critical/other existing credit' (delays or problematic handling of existing credits), or other relevant classifications (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use for the loan funds. Categories include, for example, new car, used car, radio/television, furniture/equipment, business, education, repairs, domestic appliances, and other purposes.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested or granted, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM), representing the principal loan sum before interest (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account and bonds held by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the approximate balance and serves as an indicator of financial reserves and stability. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration in years, with options including unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to repaying existing installment debts, including the loan being applied for. This is a key indicator of the individual's debt burden and remaining financial flexibility. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex, indicating marital status (e.g., married/widowed, single, divorced) combined with gender (male or female), represented as a categorical variable (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of co-applicants, guarantors, or other parties with financial responsibility for the credit. Categories include: 'none' (no other parties), 'guarantor' (a third-party guarantor), and 'co-applicant' (a joint applicant). (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence, indicating stability and local ties (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or property offered by the applicant as collateral or security for the credit (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has, categorized as 'none' (no other plans), 'bank' (a plan through a bank), or 'stores' (a plan through a department or retail store) (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of accommodation (categorical: rent, own, for free)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held and active at this same bank. This is a discrete numerical value representing the client's current credit commitments with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Employment category of the applicant, ranging from unskilled to highly qualified or self-employed (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, such as children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Status of having a registered telephone line in the applicant's name (categorical: 'yes' indicates the applicant has a telephone, 'none' indicates no telephone is registered)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio of the credit amount to the loan duration. This engineered feature captures the non-linear relationship between the principal loan size and the repayment term, helping to normalize the scale and identify cases where a high amount is requested over a very short period or a low amount over a very long period.
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: The ratio of the number of existing credits at this bank to the total credit amount of the current loan application. This is a derived numerical feature that indicates the borrower's existing credit burden relative to the size of the new loan being requested. A lower value suggests the new loan is large relative to existing commitments, while a higher value indicates a greater density of existing loans compared to the new amount. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: accounts with a negative balance ('<0'), accounts with a low positive balance ('0<=X<200'), accounts with a substantial positive balance ('>=200'), and accounts with no history ('no checking'). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit arrangement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and existing credit obligations (categorical: 'existing paid', 'critical/other existing credit', 'delayed previously', 'all paid', or 'no credits/all paid')
- name: purpose (categorical)
- desc: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific types such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, or vacation. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial goal for the credit and can reflect the risk profile associated with different spending categories.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a key numerical feature representing the principal loan amount before interest. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with the following possible levels: '<100 DM' (indicating a low balance), '100<=X<500 DM' (moderate savings), '500<=X<1000 DM' (substantial savings), '>=1000 DM' (high savings), and 'no known savings' (absence of a savings account or bonds). This feature provides insight into the applicant's financial reserves and stability. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration of employment, ranging from unemployed to long-term employment of seven years or more. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the loan, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This indicates the relative burden of the loan payment on the borrower's available monthly funds. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, combining marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced, separated) and gender (male, female) into a single categorical variable (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are additional individuals acting as co-applicants, guarantors, or debtors for the credit application. This categorical feature assesses the applicant's level of external financial support or shared liability. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability and local ties (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type and relative value of the applicant's collateral or property offered to secure the loan, categorized as 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or other similar asset classes (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's existing installment plans with other institutions, such as banks or department stores (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential occupancy (categorical: rent, own, for free)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including the one being applied for. This is a discrete numerical value that reflects the applicant's current debt obligations and credit exposure with this specific financial institution. (numerical)
- job: Occupation or type of employment of the applicant, categorized as unskilled and non-resident, unskilled and resident, skilled employee or official, or highly skilled employee or manager/self-employed/highly qualified professional/officer (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's checking account, categorized into specific monetary ranges or 'no checking' (categorical)
- duration: Length of the requested credit in months (numerical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past credit behavior, such as existing paid credits or no credits/all paid (categorical)
- purpose: Intended use of the requested credit, such as new car, radio/tv, used car, or repairs (categorical)
- credit_amount: Amount of credit requested in currency units (numerical)
- savings_status: Level of savings or bonds, categorized into specific monetary ranges or 'no known savings' (categorical)
- employment: Length of current employment, categorized into specific year ranges or 'unemployed' (categorical)
- installment_commitment: Number of existing installment commitments or loans (numerical)
- personal_status: Applicant's personal status, such as male single (categorical)
- other_parties: Presence of other parties involved in the credit application, such as none (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years at current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: Type of property owned, such as car or no known property (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Existence of other payment plans, such as bank or none (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation, such as own (categorical)
- existing_credits: Number of existing credits at this bank (numerical)
- job: Type of employment, such as unskilled resident, high qualif/self emp/mgmt, or skilled (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is financially responsible (numerical)
- own_telephone: Presence of a telephone in the applicant's name, such as yes or none (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates if the applicant is a foreign worker, such as yes (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: Logarithmic transformation of the ratio between credit amount and duration, used for scaling (numerical)
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: Ratio of existing credits to the requested credit amount, indicating debt burden (numerical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: Encoded interaction feature combining checking account status and credit history (numerical)
- age_residence_since_plus_sqrt: Feature combining age and residence duration with a square root transformation (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical: 'yes' for having a telephone, 'none' for no telephone line).
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature with two possible states: 'yes' or 'no'. This is a legal and employment status that may influence credit risk assessment based on residency stability or institutional lending policies. (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio of the credit amount to the loan duration. This feature transforms the raw credit amount per month of the loan into a logarithmic scale, which helps normalize the distribution, reduce the impact of extreme values, and capture the non-linear relationship between credit volume, repayment period, and risk.
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: The ratio of the number of existing credits to the total credit amount, calculated as (existing_credits / credit_amount). This numerical feature indicates the density of existing debt relative to the new loan's size, where a higher value suggests more existing credit lines per unit of currency borrowed. (numerical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature created by performing a cross-label encoding of the categorical variables 'checking_status' and 'credit_history'. This process combines the two original features into a single numerical representation, capturing potential interaction effects between a client's checking account status and their historical credit repayment behavior. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_plus_sqrt: The sum of the applicant's age (in years) and the square root of the number of years they have lived at their current residence. This engineered feature combines temporal stability and life stage into a single numerical value. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with four primary levels: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). This is a critical indicator of the applicant's short-term financial liquidity and stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months (numerical). This represents the length of the loan or credit agreement, indicating the planned timeframe over which the borrowed amount is to be repaid. A longer duration typically implies smaller periodic installments but may correlate with increased overall interest cost and risk.
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, including timeliness and any defaults (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature indicates the intended use of the loan funds. Categories include, but are not limited to, business investment, new or used car purchase, home appliance or furniture acquisition, radio/television equipment, domestic needs, repairs, education, and other specific or general consumption goals.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a key numerical indicator of the financial scale of the request. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the level of monetary assets held, which serves as an indicator of financial stability and capacity for debt repayment. The categories typically represent specific monetary ranges or conditions such as no savings, low savings, moderate savings, or high savings. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges in years: unemployed or less than 1 year, 1 to 3 years, 4 to 6 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, including the new loan being applied for. This is a numerical feature representing a debt-to-income ratio for installment payments. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and gender of the applicant, including categories such as male single, female div/dep/mar, male mar/wid, and female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial commitment or support for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or collateral, which serves as a key indicator of their financial stability and security for the loan (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or stores, which may indicate existing financial commitments and credit burden (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of accommodation (categorical: rent, own, for free)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this same bank, excluding the loan being applied for. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current indebtedness to the institution. (numerical)
- job: Current employment type, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled employee, or highly qualified professional/management (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, such as children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'; this is a categorical feature that may influence credit risk assessment due to perceived stability or legal employment status differences. (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio of the credit amount to the loan duration. This feature transforms the raw credit amount per month of the loan into a logarithmic scale, which helps normalize the distribution, reduce the impact of extreme values, and capture the non-linear relationship between credit volume, repayment period, and associated risk.
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: (numerical) The ratio of the number of existing credits the applicant holds to the total credit amount of the current application. This feature quantifies the applicant's existing credit burden relative to the new loan size, with lower values indicating a larger new loan relative to current obligations and higher values suggesting a smaller new loan compared to existing credit commitments.
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: (numerical) A derived categorical interaction feature created by performing a cross-label encoding on the combination of the applicant's checking account status and their credit history. This single numerical value represents the joint effect or specific risk profile associated with a particular pairing of these two fundamental financial attributes, capturing non-linear interactions that may not be apparent when the two features are considered independently.
- age_residence_since_plus_sqrt: The sum of the applicant's age and the square root of the number of years they have lived at their current residence. This engineered numerical feature combines temporal stability and life stage, potentially capturing the compounding effect of maturity and residential tenure on credit reliability. (numerical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account in Deutsche Mark (DM), categorized as: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or '>=200' (high positive balance). This indicates liquidity and financial stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific domains such as business, education, or personal asset acquisition. This feature indicates the applicant's primary goal for the credit, which is critical for assessing the risk associated with the loan's end-use and its potential for generating repayment funds.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature indicating the scale of the financial request. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the approximate total balance into tiers: 'no known savings' indicates no verifiable savings, '<100 DM' represents a minimal balance, '100<=X<500 DM' and '500<=X<1000 DM' are intermediate tiers, and '>=1000 DM' signifies substantial savings. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges of years: unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for this credit line, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the fixed, recurring financial obligation relative to the borrower's available income after essential expenses. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating both marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced, widowed) and gender (male, female) as a combined categorical feature (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants or guarantors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This categorical feature reflects the level of external financial backing for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability of residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable property or collateral the applicant possesses, which can influence loan security (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, such as those with banks or retail stores, which may indicate existing financial commitments and credit burden (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential accommodation (e.g., rent, own, for free) (categorical)
- existing_credits: Count of all currently active credit lines or loans held by the applicant at this same bank, including the one being applied for if already approved (numerical integer)
- job: The current occupational category of the applicant, which is a categorical variable indicating their employment type and skill level. Possible categories include: unemployed/unskilled non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled employee/official, and highly qualified/self-employed/management. (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide ongoing support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their own name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- **credit_amount_duration_divide_log**: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the loan duration in months. This feature transforms the raw credit-to-duration ratio using a logarithmic scale, which helps normalize the distribution and reduce the influence of extreme values. It is designed to capture the relationship between the size of the loan and its repayment period in a continuous, non-linear manner, often useful for modeling financial risk.
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: The ratio of the number of existing loans the applicant holds to the total credit amount requested in the current application. This numerical feature quantifies the applicant's existing debt burden relative to the size of the new loan, where a higher value indicates more existing credit lines per unit of currency sought, potentially signaling higher leverage or financial strain. (numerical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: (numerical) A derived feature created by performing a cross-label encoding of the 'checking_status' and 'credit_history' categorical variables. This process combines the two original features into a single numerical identifier, which captures potential interaction effects between a client's account balance status and their historical credit repayment behavior.
- age_residence_since_plus_sqrt: The sum of the applicant's age and the square root of the number of years they have lived at their current residence. This engineered feature combines temporal stability (residence duration) with life stage (age) into a single numerical value. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account in Deutsche Mark (DM), categorized into specific financial ranges: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '200<=X' (moderate to high positive balance), and '<0' (negative balance/overdraft). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months representing the length of the loan or credit arrangement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment compliance and existing credit obligations (categorical: 'existing paid', 'critical/other existing credit', 'delayed previously', 'all paid', or 'no credits/all paid')
- **purpose**: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific types such as new car, used car, business, education, home improvement, or other defined classes. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial goal for the credit and is a critical factor in risk assessment, as different purposes carry varying levels of default risk and economic cyclicality. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum, which influences both the applicant's debt burden and the lender's risk exposure. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with common tiers indicating the level of savings, such as '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', and 'unknown/no savings account'. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges: less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer). This represents the current burden of regular debt payments outside of the credit being applied for.
- personal_status: Personal status and sex, indicating marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced, separated) combined with gender (male, female), represented as a categorical variable (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated for the credit. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability and local community ties (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or type of the applicant's most valuable property or collateral offered (categorical). Categories include: real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property.
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's other concurrent installment plans with banks or retail stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential occupancy (categorical: rent, own, for free)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value represents the applicant's current active credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, unskilled non-resident, skilled employee, or highly skilled employee/manager. (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other individuals, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio of the credit amount (loan sum) to the loan duration in months. This feature transforms the raw credit amount per month into a logarithmic scale, which helps normalize the distribution, reduce the impact of extreme values, and capture non-linear relationships between credit size, repayment period, and risk.
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: The ratio of the number of existing credits the applicant holds to the total credit amount of the current loan application. It is a numerical feature that indicates the applicant's existing credit burden relative to the size of the new loan, where a higher value suggests more existing credits per unit of currency requested. (numerical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: (numerical) A derived feature created by performing a cross-tabulation of the 'checking_status' and 'credit_history' categorical variables, followed by label encoding. This process combines the two original features into a single numerical value that represents their unique interaction, potentially capturing non-linear relationships for the model.
- age_residence_since_plus_sqrt: A derived numerical feature calculated as the sum of the applicant's age and the square root of the number of years they have lived at their current residence. This feature combines temporal stability and life stage into a single metric. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) and categorized into specific monetary ranges or conditions, such as negative balances, low positive balances, or the absence of an account. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months for which the loan is requested or agreed upon, representing the planned repayment period (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and existing credit obligations (categorical: 'existing paid', 'critical/other existing credit', 'delayed previously', 'all paid', or 'no credits/all paid')
- name: purpose (categorical)
- desc: The intended use for the requested loan funds, categorized into specific domains such as business, education, personal consumption, or asset acquisition. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial goal for the credit and can reflect risk profiles associated with different spending categories.
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum that the individual seeks to borrow. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the approximate balance range: '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years of service: unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer). This represents the current burden of fixed, regular payments the applicant must make toward other debts.
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, including categories such as "male single," "female div/dep/mar," and other combinations (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of additional parties who have co-signed or guaranteed the loan, serving as secondary sources of repayment if the primary debtor defaults. Categories include: 'none' (no other parties involved), 'guarantor' (a third-party guarantees the loan), and 'co-applicant' (another person applies jointly for the credit). (categorical)
- residence_since: The duration, in years, that the applicant has lived at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset, which serves as potential collateral (e.g., real estate, car, no known property) (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's other concurrent installment plans with banks or retail stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of accommodation (e.g., rent, own, for free) (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held and actively managed by the applicant at this specific banking institution. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current credit relationship volume with the bank. (numerical)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized as: 'unskilled resident', 'unemployed/unskilled non-resident', 'skilled employee/official', or 'highly qualified/self-employed/management'. (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their own name. This is a categorical feature with two possible states: 'none' signifies no personal telephone line is available, while 'yes' indicates the applicant has a personal telephone. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess potential residency stability and employment authorization status (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio of the credit amount to the loan duration. This engineered feature captures the non-linear relationship between the principal loan size and its repayment term, helping to normalize the scale and expose patterns where high amounts over short durations (or vice versa) may influence risk.
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: The ratio of the number of existing credits the applicant holds to the total credit amount of the current application, calculated as (existing_credits / credit_amount). This feature quantifies the applicant's existing credit burden relative to the size of the new loan, where a higher value may indicate a greater density of debt obligations per unit of currency requested. (numerical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: (numerical) A feature engineered by performing a cross-label encoding on the categorical variables for checking account status and credit history. This process creates a single numerical identifier that represents the unique combination of a customer's checking account standing and their past credit repayment behavior, capturing potential interaction effects between these two fundamental financial trust indicators.
- age_residence_since_plus_sqrt: The square root of the applicant's age added to the number of years they have resided at their current address. This engineered feature combines temporal stability and life stage into a single numerical value, where a higher result may indicate greater maturity and residential stability. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). This feature indicates the applicant's short-term financial liquidity and stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical variable indicating the applicant's past credit behavior and repayment reliability, with categories including 'existing paid' (current credits properly serviced), 'all paid' (all previous credits duly repaid), 'critical/other existing credit' (delayed payments or problematic existing credits), 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all previously cleared), and 'existing paid this bank' (existing credits with this bank being properly serviced).
- name: purpose (categorical)  
- purpose: Specifies the intended use of the requested loan, which is a key indicator of risk and repayment capacity. Categories include specific goals such as 'new car', 'used car', 'furniture/equipment', 'radio/television', 'domestic appliances', 'repairs', 'education', 'vacation', 'retraining', 'business', and 'other'.
- credit_amount: The total amount of credit requested by the applicant in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and/or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions: '<100 DM' for balances under 100 DM, '100<=X<500 DM' for balances between 100 and 499 DM, '500<=X<1000 DM' for balances between 500 and 999 DM, '>=1000 DM' for balances of 1000 DM or more, and 'no known savings' for when no savings or bonds are declared. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration ranges, indicating the length of time the applicant has been with their present employer. The categories are: '<1' (less than 1 year), '1<=X<4' (1 to under 4 years), '4<=X<7' (4 to under 7 years), '>=7' (7 years or more), and 'unemployed'. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, including the new loan being considered. This is a continuous numerical feature representing a debt-to-income ratio for installment payments. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as male single, male married or widowed, female divorced or separated, or female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated for the credit (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability and local community ties (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset, which serves as collateral or an indicator of financial stability (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds with banks or stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating the type of accommodation they occupy (e.g., rent, own, or other forms of housing) (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including loans and credit lines, which indicates the applicant's existing debt obligations and relationship depth with the institution (numerical integer)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and employment type (e.g., unskilled, skilled, highly qualified/self-employed/management). (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their own name. This is a categorical feature with possible values 'yes' (has a telephone) or 'none' (no telephone). (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' for domestic workers and 'no' for foreign workers (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the loan duration. This engineered feature captures the non-linear relationship between the principal loan size and its repayment term, helping to normalize the scale and identify cases where a large amount is requested over a very short period or a small amount over a very long period.
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: The ratio of the number of existing credits the applicant holds at other banks to the total credit amount of the current loan application. It is a numerical feature calculated as `existing_credits / credit_amount`, providing a measure of existing debt burden relative to the size of the new loan being requested. A lower value indicates the new loan is large relative to the applicant's current number of credit lines, while a higher value suggests a greater density of existing credits for the loan amount. (numerical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature created by performing a cross-label encoding on the combination of two categorical variables: 'checking_status' and 'credit_history'. This encoding assigns a unique integer to each distinct pairing of the original categories, capturing potential interaction effects between a client's account balance status and their historical credit repayment behavior. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_plus_sqrt: The sum of the applicant's age and the square root of the number of years they have lived at their current residence. This engineered feature combines temporal stability and life stage into a single numerical value. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized into four levels based on the account balance in Deutsche Mark (DM): 'no checking' indicates no account, '<0' denotes a negative balance, '0<=X<200' represents a low positive balance, and '>=200' signifies a substantial positive balance. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: Specifies the intended use of the requested loan, which indicates the applicant's financial goal and risk profile associated with that type of expenditure. Common categories include business investment, consumer durables like furniture or cars, education, or domestic appliances.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum whose risk is being assessed. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the approximate balance range: no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, or 1000 DM and more. This reflects the applicant's available liquid assets and financial buffer. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges in years: less than 1 year, 1 to under 4 years, 4 to under 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for this loan, expressed as a fixed percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the committed portion of income that will be dedicated to repaying this specific credit. (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male married/widowed, female, and male divorced/separated (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated for the credit. This feature reflects the level of external financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or property offered by the applicant as collateral or security for the credit, which influences the perceived risk and loan terms (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans with banks or stores, indicating the applicant's existing debt obligations from similar credit sources (categorical)
- housing: Indicates the applicant's current housing situation, which can be one of several categorical values such as renting, owning a home, or living for free. This feature reflects the applicant's residential stability and potential financial commitments related to accommodation. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including loans and credit lines. This numerical value represents the applicant's current credit burden and ongoing financial commitments to the institution. (numerical)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled employee, or highly qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other individuals, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess immigration status and potential stability or risk factors in the credit evaluation (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the credit amount divided by the loan duration in months. This engineered feature captures the non-linear relationship between the principal loan size and its repayment term, helping to normalize the scale and expose patterns that might be missed by using the raw values alone. (numerical)
- existing_credits_credit_amount_ratio: The ratio of the number of existing credits the applicant holds to the total credit amount of the current loan application. It is a numerical feature that indicates the applicant's existing credit burden relative to the size of the new loan being requested. A lower value suggests the new loan is large relative to existing commitments, while a higher value suggests a higher density of existing credits compared to the loan amount. (numerical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature representing the combined categorical interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their past credit history, encoded into a single integer label through a cross-tabulation and label encoding process. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_plus_sqrt: A derived numerical feature calculated as the square root of the applicant's age added to the number of years they have resided at their current address. It combines temporal stability indicators into a single metric. (numerical)
