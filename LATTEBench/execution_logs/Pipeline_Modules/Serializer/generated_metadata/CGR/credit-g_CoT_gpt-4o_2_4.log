This is a categorical feature with common values including 'real estate' (property with significant value), 'car' (an automobile), 'life insurance' (a valid insurance policy), or 'no known property' (indicating no significant assets are declared). (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:

- credit_history: Records of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including repayment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's checking account, categorized by balance range or account type (categorical)
- duration: Length of the requested credit in months (numerical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past behavior with credit, including repayment timeliness and existing credit status (categorical)
- purpose: Intended use of the requested loan funds, such as for a car, education, or furniture (categorical)
- credit_amount: Total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant (numerical)
- savings_status: Level of savings or bonds held by the applicant, categorized by monetary range (categorical)
- employment: Applicant's current employment length, categorized in years (categorical)
- installment_commitment: Fixed monthly repayment amount as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income (numerical)

- property_magnitude: Type and scale of the applicant's owned property, such as real estate or a car (categorical)
- age: Applicant's age in years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Existence of other installment plans or debts with stores or banks (categorical)
- housing: Applicant's current living arrangement, such as owning, renting, or living for free (categorical)
- existing_credits: Number of existing credit lines or loans the applicant currently holds (numerical)
- job: Applicant's employment type and skill level (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of people financially dependent on the applicant (numerical)
- own_telephone: Presence of a telephone in the applicant's name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicator of whether the applicant is a foreign worker (categorical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: Encoded interaction feature combining checking account status and credit history (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with bands indicating the approximate balance level, such as '<100 DM', '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges of years: unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 3 years, 4 to 6 years, or 7 years and above. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer).
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, encompassing categories such as male single, female div/dep/mar (divorced/separated/widowed or married), male mar/wid (married or widowed), and male div/sep (divorced or separated) (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This categorical feature reflects the level of external financial backing for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical). A lower value may indicate less residential stability, while a higher value suggests greater stability and longer-term community ties.
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable property or asset owned by the applicant, used as a form of collateral or to assess financial stability (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's current age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates whether the applicant has any other concurrent installment plans, such as those with other banks or retail stores. This feature reflects existing financial commitments that could impact the applicant's ability to repay a new loan. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value indicates the applicant's current level of credit engagement and concurrent debt obligations with this financial institution. (numerical)
- job: Current employment occupation category, indicating the applicant's professional qualification level and employment type (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible values: 'yes' if a telephone is registered, or 'none' if no telephone is registered. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess immigration status and its potential association with employment stability and credit risk (categorical)
- checking_status_credit_history_cross_label_encode: A numerical feature created by performing a cross-label encoding on the combination of the 'checking_status' and 'credit_history' categorical features. This process generates a single numerical identifier for each unique pairing of the two original feature values, capturing potential interaction effects between a customer's account status and their past credit repayment behavior. (numerical)
