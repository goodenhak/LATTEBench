Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their requested credit amount. Each value is a specific pairing (e.g., '<0_5179', '0<=X<200_2671', 'no checking_1655'), where the first part indicates the checking account category and the second part is a discrete credit amount, together forming a single cross-tabulated category.
- duration: Duration in months (numerical)  
  This feature represents the length of the loan or credit agreement, measured in months. It indicates the planned period over which the borrower is expected to repay the borrowed amount, with longer durations often associated with larger loans or different risk assessments.
- name: purpose  
  desc: The specific intended use for the credit requested by the applicant, categorized into types such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation, retraining, or other purposes. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the applicant's level of liquid savings and bonds held. The categories represent specific monetary ranges: '<100' indicates less than 100 DM, '100<=X<500' indicates between 100 and 499 DM, '500<=X<1000' indicates between 500 and 999 DM, and '>=1000' indicates 1000 DM or more. The category 'no known savings' indicates no savings account or bonds are declared. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the loan or credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of valuable assets or property the applicant possesses, which can be used as collateral or as an indicator of financial stability (categorical)
- job: Occupation of the applicant, categorized by skill level and type (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the applicant's time in years at their current residence. This is a continuous numerical feature calculated as (duration / residence_since), where a higher value indicates a longer loan term relative to residential stability. (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical variable representing the applicant's historical record of credit repayment, which includes classifications such as 'all paid' (indicating all previous credits were properly repaid), 'delayed previously' (suggesting past delays in payments), and 'existing paid' (denoting that existing credits are being paid back as agreed). This feature assesses the risk level based on past financial behavior. (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the account balance level and is a categorical feature with values such as 'no checking', '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current address (numerical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, such as those with banks or retail stores, which may impact the applicant's existing debt burden and repayment capacity (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (numerical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of any co-applicants, guarantors, or other parties associated with the credit application. This captures whether the applicant is applying alone, with a co-applicant, or with a guarantor, which influences the perceived risk and security of the loan. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the number of years with the current employer. The categories are: less than 1 year ('unemployed'), 1 to less than 4 years ('1<=X<4'), 4 to less than 7 years ('4<=X<7'), and 7 or more years ('>=7'). (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross: (categorical) A combined feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and the specific credit amount requested. It encodes discrete categories where each category is a unique pairing (e.g., '<0_2579', '>=200_947', '0<=X<200_5965', 'no checking_3527') to capture non-linear relationships that may be more predictive of risk than either feature alone.
- duration: Duration in months of the credit loan or installment plan (numerical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the requested loan, representing a discrete category such as 'radio/tv', 'furniture/equipment', 'car', or 'business'. It is a fundamental determinant of risk and loan terms, as different purposes are associated with varying levels of collateral value, necessity, and borrower financial behavior.
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the total liquid savings held, which is a key indicator of financial stability and capacity to handle credit obligations. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, denominated in Deutsche Marks (DM), representing the principal sum before interest (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or property owned by the applicant, used to assess financial stability and collateral (categorical)
- job: Current employment position or occupational category of the applicant, indicating skill level and employment stability (categorical)
- **duration_residence_since_divide**: (numerical) The ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time at their current residence (in years). This engineered feature quantifies the relationship between the length of the credit agreement and the applicant's residential stability, where higher values may indicate a longer loan term relative to a shorter period of residence.
- credit_history: A categorical feature describing the applicant's past credit behavior and repayment reliability, with possible values including 'no credits/all paid', 'existing paid', 'critical/other existing credit', 'delayed previously', and 'all paid' (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the account balance and overdraft status into specific ranges. (categorical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross: A combined feature representing the interaction between the applicant's checking account status and the credit amount, formatted as 'checking_status_credit_amount' (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, or people for whom the applicant is legally and financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability and roots in the community (numerical)
- age: Age of the individual applicant in whole years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- installment_commitment: Number of existing installment commitments, such as other loans or monthly payment obligations, that the applicant is currently responsible for (numerical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This feature reflects the level of external financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the number of years the applicant has been with their current employer. The categories are: unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to less than 4 years, 4 to less than 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and the specific credit amount requested. Each value is a string concatenation of a checking_status category (e.g., '<0', '0<=X<200') and the exact credit_amount, joined by an underscore (e.g., '<0_6836'). It captures the relationship between account liquidity and the loan size for risk assessment.
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the requested loan funds. Categories include, but are not limited to, new car, business, education, furniture/equipment, domestic appliance, repairs, vacation, retraining, or other specific consumer needs.
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, denominated in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the approximate total balance across all such holdings. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's valuable property, such as real estate, a car, or savings. This indicates the level of tangible assets that could serve as collateral. The categories include: 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', 'no known property', or 'unknown/no property'. (categorical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized as: unskilled resident, skilled employee/official, high qualified professional/self-employed/management, or unemployed/other. (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan's duration in months to the applicant's time of residence at their current address in years. A higher value may indicate a relatively long loan term compared to a short period of residency. (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'critical/other existing credit' (indicating delays or other problematic credit), 'existing paid' (current credits properly serviced so far), and 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all previous credits paid duly). (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no checking' (no account), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '200<=X' (moderate or high balance), and '<0' (negative balance/overdraft). (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line. This is a categorical feature with the classes 'yes' (indicating the applicant has a telephone) and 'none' (indicating the applicant does not have a telephone). (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's current age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans for loans or credit, typically with banks or retail stores. This indicates existing financial commitments that may affect repayment risk. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is currently obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer).
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial backing for the loan. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the number of years the applicant has been with their current employer. The categories are: unemployed or very short tenure (<1 year), short tenure (1 to less than 4 years), medium tenure (4 to less than 7 years), and long tenure (7 years or more). (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross: (categorical) A composite feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and the specific credit amount requested. It encodes combined categories such as '<0_7865', where the first part indicates the checking account tier (e.g., '<0', '0<=X<200', 'no checking') and the second part is the exact credit amount, capturing non-linear relationships between account status and loan size that may influence risk.
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include, but are not limited to, radio/tv, furniture/equipment, car, business, education, and repairs.
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the total level of savings and investments. (categorical)

- job: Current employment classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and type (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time at their current residence (in years). This numerical feature may highlight stability, as a lower ratio suggests longer-term residence relative to the loan term. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including timeliness of payments and any previous delinquencies or defaults (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance level: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross: A categorical interaction feature combining the applicant's checking account status and the credit amount of the loan. It represents specific, binned pairings of these two original attributes (e.g., '<0_1131', '0<=X<200_11560', 'no checking_936'), which may capture non-linear relationships or specific risk profiles between account status and loan size. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the credit agreement or loan term (numerical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include specific goals such as 'new car', 'used car', 'furniture/equipment', 'radio/tv', 'domestic appliances', 'repairs', 'education', 'vacation', 'retraining', 'business', and 'other'.
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the approximate balance range, which serves as a proxy for financial stability and liquidity. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a key numerical indicator of the financial scale of the request. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or type of valuable property owned by the applicant, used as an indicator of financial stability and collateral (e.g., real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property) (categorical)
- job: Employment category of the applicant, including skilled, unskilled resident, unemp/unskilled non-resident, and high-level professional/management roles (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the applicant's time in years at their current residence. This feature is calculated by dividing the 'duration' of the credit by the 'residence_since' period. It is a numerical value that may indicate stability, as a higher ratio could suggest a longer financial commitment relative to residential tenure. (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'existing paid' for current credits properly serviced, 'delayed previously' for past critical or delinquent accounts, 'critical/other existing credit' for existing credits with issues, 'all paid' for previously settled credits, and 'no credits/all paid' for no prior credit history. (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. These categories indicate the account balance range or absence of an account, and are: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- num_dependents: The count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's current age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence of other concurrent installment payment plans with either banks or retail stores. A 'none' value signifies no other active installment debt, while 'bank' or 'stores' specifies the type of creditor holding an existing plan. This feature helps assess the applicant's current debt burden and repayment obligations. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (numerical/integer). This represents the total concurrent installment-based debts, such as car loans or furniture payments, that are considered in the risk assessment.
- other_parties: Other debtors / guarantors (categorical). This feature indicates whether there are any co-applicants, guarantors, or other parties who share responsibility for the credit. The categories typically represent levels of support or security, such as 'none' for no other parties, 'guarantor' for someone who guarantees repayment, or 'co-applicant' for a joint applicant. The presence of other parties can influence the perceived risk of the loan.
- employment: Present employment duration category, indicating the number of years the applicant has been with their current employer. (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross: A categorical interaction feature combining the applicant's checking account status and the exact credit amount requested. It represents specific risk patterns identified from the combination of these two factors, such as '<0_684' or '0<=X<200_1512'. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the loan funds, such as for a car, business, appliance, or other defined categories.
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of known savings: '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', and 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum for which the individual is seeking financial approval. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most substantial asset or collateral the applicant has declared, which serves as a key indicator of financial stability and security for the loan. This feature classifies the type of property, such as real estate, car, life insurance, or no known property. (categorical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized as unemployed/unskilled non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled employee, or highly skilled/management/officer (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence. This is a derived numerical feature that may indicate stability or risk by comparing the commitment period of the loan to the applicant's residential tenure. (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with values including 'existing paid' for current credits duly serviced, 'critical/other existing credit' for delayed payments or other problematic existing credits, and 'all paid' for all previous credits fully repaid at this bank. (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with four common levels: 'no checking account', '0 <= X < 200 DM' (indicating a low positive balance), '200 <= X' (indicating a moderate to high positive balance), and 'X < 0' (indicating an overdrawn or negative balance). (categorical)
