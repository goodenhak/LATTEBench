2025-12-19 14:59:02,172 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three feature engineering steps:

1. \<total_credit_exposure\><plus>\<credit_amount\>\<installment_commitment\>\<total_credit_exposure_as_sum_of_credit_amount_and_installment_commitment\>
    - Reasoning: Combining the credit amount and installment commitment provides a holistic view of an applicant's total debt obligation. This can help identify applicants with potentially high total credit exposure relative to their income and other financial metrics.

2. \<age_duration_ratio\><divide>\<age\>\<duration\>\<ratio_of_age_to_loan_duration\>
    - Reasoning: This feature normalizes the duration of the loan by the applicant's age, revealing insights into the relationship between the applicant's age and their loan term preferences. Younger applicants might prefer shorter loan durations, while older applicants might opt for longer terms.

3. \<employment_savings_cross\><cross>\<employment\>\<savings_status\>\<interaction_of_employment_and_savings_status\>
    - Reasoning: Crossing employment status with savings status can capture interactions between these two factors, which may influence an applicant's financial stability and risk profile. For example, long-term employment with high savings indicates higher stability, which could positively impact the credit decision.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all prior credits duly paid), 'existing paid' (currently has credits and all are in good standing), 'critical/other existing credit' (has delayed payments or other problematic existing credit), 'all paid' (all previous credits have been repaid), and 'delayed previously' (had past payment delays but has since cleared them).
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including any that are open, ongoing, or not yet fully repaid (numerical integer)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)

- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as male single, female divorced/separated/married, or male married/widowed (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of additional individuals who are either co-applicants, guarantors, or have no involvement in the credit application. This categorical feature indicates the level of third-party financial responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- credit_amount_log: Natural_logarithm_of_the_credit_amount_in_DM_used_to_normalize_distribution_and_mitigate_the_influence_of_extreme_high-value_loans (numerical)
- checking_status_numerical: Encoded_representation_of_the_applicant's_checking_account_status_where_lower_values_indicate_a_healthier_balance_and_higher_values_indicate_increasing_risk_or_no_account (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges: no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and 1000 DM or more. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized as unemployed, less than 1 year, between 1 and 4 years, between 4 and 7 years, or 7 years and above. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the loan in months, representing the agreed-upon period for repayment (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable with two possible states that may influence perceived employment stability and credit risk (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_history: The applicant's past behavior with credit, categorized as 'all paid' (all previous credits paid back duly), 'delayed previously' (some past credits had delayed payments), 'critical/other existing credit' (currently has problematic or other existing credit), 'existing paid' (has existing credits all paid back duly so far), or 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all prior credits paid back duly). (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including the one being applied for. This is a discrete numerical feature where a higher number may indicate a greater existing debt burden. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence address, indicating residential stability (numerical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their living arrangement and financial commitment related to accommodation (categorical: 'rent', 'own', 'for free', or 'other')
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/divorced, female divorced/separated/married, or female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional parties who have committed to guarantee the loan or share responsibility for repayment. This includes co-applicants, guarantors, or the absence of such parties. (categorical)
- credit_amount_log: Natural logarithm of the original credit amount in Deutsche Marks, applied to reduce positive skew and mitigate the influence of extreme high-value loans, thereby improving model stability (numerical)
- checking_status_numerical: Encoded numerical representation of the applicant's checking account status, where lower values typically indicate higher financial risk (e.g., no account or overdrawn) and higher values indicate lower risk (e.g., a healthy account balance), used to quantify associated credit risk (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with the following possible ranges: no savings account; less than 100 DM; between 100 DM and 500 DM; between 500 DM and 1000 DM; or 1000 DM and above. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment with the current employer. The categories are: '<1' (less than one year), '1<=X<4' (between one and four years), '4<=X<7' (between four and seven years), and '>=7' (seven years or more). (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the agreed repayment period for the loan (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no'; this is a key demographic and legal status variable that may influence risk assessment due to differing employment stability, residency rights, or banking history (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_history: The applicant's past behavior with credit, categorized by their repayment performance on previous loans (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including the one being applied for. This is a discrete numerical feature where a higher number may indicate a greater existing debt burden. (numerical)
- residence_since: Duration (in years) the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- housing: Type of current housing accommodation, categorized as rent (tenant), own (homeowner), for free (living without rent payment), or other arrangements (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as "male single", "male married/divorced", "female single", "female divorced/separated/married", or other relevant marital and gender classifications (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- credit_amount_log: Natural logarithm of the original credit amount in Deutsche Marks, applied to reduce positive skew and mitigate the influence of extreme high-value loans, thereby improving model stability (numerical)
- checking_status_numerical: Encoded numerical representation of the applicant's checking account status, where a lower value typically indicates a healthier financial state (e.g., no checking account or positive balance) and a higher value indicates higher risk (e.g., overdrawn or insufficient funds), used to quantify associated credit risk (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: 'no known savings' (no verifiable savings), '<100 DM' (less than 100 DM), '100<=X<500 DM' (between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000 DM' (between 500 and 999 DM), and '>=1000 DM' (1000 DM or more). (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no', which may influence perceived employment stability and credit risk (categorical)

- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: '<100' for less than 100 DM, '100<=X<500' for between 100 and less than 500 DM, '500<=X<1000' for between 500 and less than 1000 DM, '>=1000' for 1000 DM or more, and 'no known savings' for accounts with no savings or bonds recorded. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges in years, with possible values including 'unemployed', '1<=X<4', '4<=X<7', and others as defined in the dataset. (categorical)
