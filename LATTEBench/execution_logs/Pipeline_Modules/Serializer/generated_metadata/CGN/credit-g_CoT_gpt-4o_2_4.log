3. \<employment_length\><label_encode><employment><numerical_representation_of_employment_length\>

Explanation:
1. monthly_credit_amount: Calculating the average monthly payment required (credit_amount divided by duration) gives insight into the borrower's payment schedule and can influence credit approval if the monthly installment seems feasible based on income or other financial metrics.

2. has_property: Converting the property_magnitude into a numerical feature helps identify the applicant's asset value or type, which is associated with financial stability. Borrowers with substantial property, like real estate, may have advantages in credit approval processes due to perceived financial reliability.

3. employment_length: Converting the employment status into a numerical representation can help assess the applicant's job stability and security. Longer employment history might correlate with a lower-risk client who is likely to meet credit obligations.

2025-12-19 14:39:27,553 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_to_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration>
   - Reasoning: This feature represents the credit amount relative to the loan duration. A lower ratio could indicate that the applicant is asking for less money relative to the loan period, which might be favorable for creditworthiness.

2. <checking_status_encoded><label_encode><checking_status><Encoded_checking_account_status>
   - Reasoning: Encoding the categorical checking account status into a numerical form can help machine learning models to process and understand these categories more effectively, potentially revealing hidden patterns related to credit approval.

3. <employment_savings_cross><cross><employment_length><savings_status><Cross_of_employment_length_and_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: Crossing these two features can capture interactions between employment stability and savings, possibly providing insights into the applicant's financial reliability and stability, crucial factors in determining credit approval.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a continuous numerical value representing the principal sum. (numerical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from the start date to the final payment due date (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account's balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). This is a categorical feature.
- credit_history: A categorical feature that indicates the borrower's past credit behavior and repayment reliability, with categories including 'existing paid' (current credits properly serviced), 'delayed previously' (past credit delays), 'critical/other existing credit' (problematic current credits), 'all paid' (all previous credits fully repaid), and 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid) (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This categorical feature indicates the approximate balance tier and may reflect the applicant's financial stability. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of consecutive years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is currently obligated to pay, representing ongoing financial liabilities (integer)
- checking_status_encoded: Numerically encoded representation of the applicant's checking account status, where a lower value generally indicates a more precarious financial position (e.g., overdrawn) and a higher value indicates a more stable or unknown status. This is a derived numerical feature from the original categorical 'checking_status'. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's primary asset or collateral offered, which influences credit security (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance. This is a count of individuals and is a numerical feature. (numerical)
- employment_length: number of years the applicant has been employed at their current job, encoded as an integer where 0 = unemployed, 1 = <1 year, 2 = 1 to <4 years, 3 = 4 to <7 years, and 4 = ≥7 years (numerical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties (debtors or guarantors) associated with the credit application, with categories including 'none', 'guarantor', or 'co-applicant' (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable with two possible states: 'yes' if the individual is a foreign worker, or 'no' if they are a domestic worker (categorical)

Data Examples:
credit_amount is 3965. duration is 42. checking_status is <0. credit_history is existing paid. savings_status is <100. residence_since is 3. installment_commitment is 4. checking_status_encoded is 1. property_magnitude is car. num_dependents is 1. employment_length is 2. other_parties is none. foreign_worker is yes.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in ranges of Deutsche Mark (DM) balance or absence of an account. Categories include: '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '>=200' (substantial balance), and 'no checking' (no account). (categorical)
- credit_history: The applicant's past credit behavior, categorized into groups such as existing paid (all credits at this bank paid back duly), critical/other existing credit (delays in paying off credits or other critical account status), existing paid (no credits taken or all credits paid back duly), or other specific credit standing classifications (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of an account: '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', and 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer).
- checking_status_encoded: An encoded numerical representation of the applicant's checking account status, derived from the original categorical 'checking_status' feature. It maps categories such as '<0', '0<=X<200', and 'no checking' to discrete integer values for model processing (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of valuable assets or collateral the applicant possesses, which may be used to secure the credit (e.g., real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property) (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, specifically people for whom the applicant is legally liable to provide financial maintenance and support, such as children or other qualifying relatives (numerical)
- employment_length: number of years the applicant has been employed at their current job, encoded as an integer where higher values indicate longer tenure (numerical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional parties who have co-signed or guaranteed the loan, serving as secondary debtors or guarantors for the credit obligation (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable used to assess employment stability and residency status (categorical)

2025-12-19 14:44:35,143 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_amount_by_duration\>divide\<credit_amount\>\<duration\>\<Averagecreditrequestedpermonthduration\>
   - Reasoning: By normalizing the credit amount by the duration, we obtain a measure of average credit per month. This can help understand whether the requested monthly credit is reasonable compared to typical monthly incomes.

2. \<credit_history_savings_status_interaction\>cross\<credit_history\>\<savings_status\>\<Interactionofthecredithistoryandsavingsstatus\>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit history and savings status into a single feature provides a more nuanced understanding of the applicant's financial stability. Applicants with a good credit history and substantial savings are likely to have better creditworthiness.

3. \<employment_to_residence_ratio\>divide\<employment_length\>\<residence_since\>\<Ratiobetweencurrentemploymentlengthandresidencelength\>
   - Reasoning: This feature gives insight into the applicant's stability in both employment and residency. A low ratio may indicate recent job stability, while a high ratio might suggest long-term employment relative to their residence, which could be a positive factor in credit risk assessment.

2025-12-19 14:45:12,624 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. It indicates the balance level and whether the account is in deficit. The categories are: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment history and previous loan outcomes (categorical: 'existing paid', 'all paid', 'delayed previously', 'critical/other existing credit', 'no credits/all paid')
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: no savings ('no known savings'), low savings ('<100 DM'), moderate savings ('100 <= X < 500 DM'), substantial savings ('500 <= X < 1000 DM'), and high savings ('>=1000 DM'). (categorical)
- residence_since: The duration, in years, that the applicant has lived at their current residential address (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the loan, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the relative burden of the repayment obligation. (numerical)
- checking_status_encoded: A numerically encoded representation of the applicant's checking account status, where a value of '1' indicates a negative balance ('<0') and a value of '0' indicates a low positive balance ('0<=X<200'), as derived from the original categorical feature. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or type of the applicant's existing property that can be offered as collateral, categorized as 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property' (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, which refers to individuals, typically children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- employment_length: number of years the applicant has been employed at their current job, encoded as an integer where 0 represents less than 1 year (numerical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants or guarantors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This categorical feature indicates the level of external financial backing for the loan. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess employment stability and jurisdictional risk (categorical)
