2025-12-19 14:48:58,174 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<age_square\>\<square\>\<age\>\<Square_of_applicant's_age_to_emphasize_age_related_risks_or_opportunities\>  
   Reasoning: Squaring the age could help capture non-linear relationships between age and creditworthiness, highlighting how much being significantly younger or older might influence risk.

2. \<credit_history_label\>\<label_encode\>\<credit_history\>\<Numerical_encoding_of_credit_history_to_add_in_numerical_models\>  
   Reasoning: Converting the categorical credit history into a numerical format through label encoding can be quite beneficial, allowing the model to assess patterns related to repayment behavior in a linear fashion.

3. \<employment_savings_cross\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<savings_status\>\<Interaction_between_employment_and_savings_to_catch_the_joint_effect_on_creditworthiness\>  
   Reasoning: Crossing employment status with savings status can reveal important joint effects on credit risk. A stable employment combined with substantial savings might indicate a lower risk, while combinations like unstable employment with low savings could signal high risk.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- credit_check_cross: A categorical feature combining the applicant's checking account status and their existing credit history. It captures specific risk-relevant intersections, such as "0<=X<200_critical/other existing credit" or "no checking_critical/other existing credit," which provide a more nuanced view of financial reliability than either attribute alone. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Possible values are: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial balance). This feature reflects the applicant's short-term liquidity and financial stability. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: '<100' for less than 100 DM, '100<=X<500' for between 100 and less than 500 DM, '500<=X<1000' for between 500 and less than 1000 DM, '>=1000' for 1000 DM or more, and 'no known savings' for accounts with no savings or bonds. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, which is used to assess the applicant's current debt load and credit exposure with the institution (numerical integer)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence and type of other concurrent installment plans the applicant has, such as loans with banks or financing agreements with retail stores. This feature helps assess the applicant's existing debt burden and payment obligations. (categorical)
- employment_label: Employment_status_as_numerical_value, where 0 = unemployed, 1 = less than 1 year employed, 2 = 1 to 4 years employed, 3 = 4 to 7 years employed, and 4 = more than 7 years employed (numerical)
- installment_to_income_ratio: The proportion of an applicant's monthly installment obligation on this loan relative to their total monthly income, expressed as a decimal. This ratio measures the debt burden this specific loan would impose on the applicant's income. (numerical)
- credit_history: Credit history of the applicant, indicating their past repayment behavior with existing credits (categorical). Categories include: "existing paid" for credits paid duly to date, "critical/other existing credit" for delays or problematic handling of other credits, "all paid" for all previous credits paid back, "no credits/all paid" for no previous credits or all paid, and "delayed previously" for past critical account or delays.
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the loan funds, such as for a car, education, or business. It is a categorical variable that influences risk assessment, as different purposes are associated with varying levels of financial stability and default probability.
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'. This is a categorical feature that may influence credit risk assessment due to differing employment stability, residency status, or regulatory considerations. (categorical)
