Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_savings_cross: A combined categorical feature derived from the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and savings account status, designed to provide a more holistic indicator of immediate and short-term financial stability and liquidity. It captures joint conditions such as 'no checking_<100', where the absence of a checking account is paired with minimal savings, signaling higher financial risk. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: Specifies the intended use of the requested loan, representing the applicant's primary objective for the credit. This categorical feature includes common loan purposes such as purchasing a car (new or used), financing furniture or equipment, investing in a radio or television, covering educational costs, or funding business ventures, among others.
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical). This feature describes the applicant's past behavior with credit and existing loans. Categories include: 'existing paid' for current credits duly paid to date, 'delayed previously' for past credits where payments were late, 'critical/other existing credit' for problematic ongoing accounts, and 'all paid' for previous credits fully repaid.
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the total amount of savings and bonds held, with levels including: no known savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and 1000 DM or more. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- job: Job or employment status of the applicant, categorized by skill level and employment type (categorical)
- checking_savings_cross: Combined categorical feature representing the interaction between checking account status and savings account status, capturing potential synergistic effects on credit risk (categorical)  
- num_dependents: Number of dependents for whom the applicant is financially responsible, including children or other relatives requiring maintenance support (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, specifically categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)

2025-12-19 14:06:50,987 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the specified operators. These steps aim to capture more complex relationships between the existing features and improve the downstream model's performance.

1. <credit_per_month><divide><credit_amount><duration><Calculated_feature:Represents_the_average_amount_of_credit_the_applicant_would_pay_per_month._This_can_help_assess_the_financial_burden_of_the_credit_on_the_applicant.>

   Reasoning: Calculating the credit amount per month provides insight into the affordability of the loan for the applicant, as it spreads the credit amount over the duration period. This might be indicative of financial stress or payment feasibility.

2. <checking_savings_encoded><label_encode><checking_savings_cross><Encoded_categorical_feature:Transforms_the_interaction_of_checking_and_savings_account_statuses_into_a_numerical_form,_enabling_better_integration_with_algorithms_requiring_numerical_inputs.>

   Reasoning: Converting the combined checking and savings accounts into a numerical representation can facilitate the application of machine learning algorithms that require numerical input and might capture nuanced interactions between these two financial indicators.

3. <purpose_credit_risk><cross><purpose><credit_history><Combined_categorical_feature:Represents_the_interaction_between_the_applicant's_loan_purpose_and_their_credit_history,_potentially_identifying_purpose-specific_risks_related_to_the_applicant’s_credit_repayment_behavior.>

   Reasoning: By combining the purpose and credit history features, this step aims to capture any purpose-specific risks or patterns associated with the credit repayment behavior, which can be crucial for assessing the likelihood of credit approval.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_savings_cross: A categorical interaction feature that combines an applicant's checking account status and savings account status into a single joint indicator, providing a more comprehensive assessment of overall financial stability and liquidity by capturing the combined effect of both short-term transaction account health and medium-term savings reserves. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific balance ranges or conditions: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include specific goals such as 'new car', 'furniture/equipment', and others, which help indicate the risk profile and economic sector associated with the credit.
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from its start date until the final payment is due (numerical)
- credit_history: Credit history of the applicant, indicating their past behavior with credit and existing obligations (categorical).
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges or conditions: no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, or 1000 DM and more. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- job: Employment occupation category of the applicant, indicating their primary type of work or employment status (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance. This is a numerical integer feature. (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no', which is a factor in assessing employment stability and residency status (categorical)
- checking_savings_encoded: A composite numerical feature engineered by encoding the combined states of an applicant's checking account and savings account statuses. This feature is designed to capture nuanced patterns of financial stability and liquidity that may not be apparent when considering the two attributes separately, with higher values generally indicating higher financial risk (numerical)
- credit_to_duration_ratio: The ratio of the credit amount to the loan duration, calculated as credit_amount divided by duration. This feature measures the proportional monthly financial commitment, where a higher ratio indicates a larger credit amount per month of the loan term, useful for assessing repayment burden intensity (numerical)
- job_housing_cross: A categorical interaction feature combining the applicant's occupational category and housing type, designed to capture socio-economic profiles and stability indicators that influence credit risk assessment, such as income reliability paired with housing expense commitments (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_savings_cross: Interaction feature combining checking account status and savings account status, representing a joint financial health profile that may capture risk patterns not evident in either feature alone (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges: 'no checking' indicates no account, '<0' indicates a negative balance, '0<=X<200' indicates a low positive balance, and '>=200' indicates a substantial positive balance. (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- desc: The intended use for the requested loan, categorizing the primary economic or personal objective the credit will finance. This feature is critical for risk assessment as different purposes have varying associated risks, repayment profiles, and likelihood of generating returns.
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan repayment period (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical variable describing the applicant's past credit behavior, including categories such as 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', and 'no credits/all paid'. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges: '<100 DM' for less than 100, '100<=X<500 DM' for 100 to 499, '500<=X<1000 DM' for 500 to 999, '>=1000 DM' for 1000 or more, and 'no known savings' for absent or unknown accounts. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing status of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- job: Job (categorical) - The applicant's current employment type, categorized by skill level and employment status (e.g., skilled, unskilled resident, management, unemployed).
- num_dependents: Count of individuals for whom the credit applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance, such as children or other dependents (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable used to assess employment stability and residency status (categorical)
- checking_savings_encoded: A numerical feature engineered by combining the checking account status and savings account status into a single categorical encoding. This captures interaction effects and patterns in an applicant's combined short-term and medium-term financial stability, which may be more predictive of credit risk than either status alone (numerical)
- credit_to_duration_ratio: The ratio of the loan credit amount to the loan duration in months, representing the monthly financial burden or proportional commitment per unit of time, with higher values indicating larger credit amounts relative to shorter repayment periods (numerical)
- job_housing_cross: Combined categorical feature representing the interaction between a person's occupational category and their housing situation, used to capture socio-economic profiles and stability indicators that influence credit risk assessment and loan approval decisions (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_savings_cross: A categorical interaction feature combining the applicant's checking account status and savings account status, designed to provide a more comprehensive indicator of their short-term and medium-term financial liquidity and stability by assessing the joint condition of these two key transactional accounts. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a continuous numerical feature representing the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include accounts with a positive balance ('<0'), a moderately negative balance ('0<=X<200'), a severely negative balance ('>=200'), or the absence of an account ('no checking'). (categorical)
- name: purpose  
  desc: The intended use of the requested credit, categorized into specific loan purposes such as used car, radio/tv, furniture/equipment, other, etc. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months for the credit loan, representing the contractual period over which the loan is to be repaid (numerical)
- credit_history: The applicant's past record of credit management and repayment, categorized as 'no credits/all paid', 'all paid', 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', or 'critical/other existing credit' (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of savings. (categorical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating their current living arrangement (categorical: rent, own, for free)
- job: Job (categorical) - The applicant's current employment type and skill level, categorized as: 'unskilled non-resident', 'unskilled resident', 'skilled', or 'high qualif/self emp/mgmt'. This feature reflects occupational stability and income potential.
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, such as children or other family members, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance. This is a count of individuals and is represented as a numerical integer value. (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'. This is a categorical feature that may influence credit risk assessment due to differing employment stability or residency status. (categorical)
- checking_savings_encoded: A numerical feature engineered by combining the checking account status and savings account status into a single encoded representation, designed to capture underlying patterns of financial stability and liquidity that may not be apparent when considering each status independently (numerical)
- credit_to_duration_ratio: The ratio of the total credit amount to the loan duration in months, representing the monthly proportional financial burden or commitment if the loan were evenly distributed over its term, with higher values indicating larger monthly credit exposure (numerical)
- job_housing_cross: Combined categorical feature representing the interaction between occupation type and housing status, used to assess socio-economic stability and repayment capacity by capturing employment security and residential commitment (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_savings_cross: Interaction feature combining checking account status and savings account status, designed to capture a more holistic view of an applicant's short-term and medium-term financial liquidity and stability, which serves as a joint indicator of overall financial health and risk (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range or absence of an account: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- **name**: purpose  
  **desc**: The intended use of the requested credit, categorized into specific common loan purposes such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, vacation, retraining, business, or other. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature indicating the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'existing paid' for credits properly serviced, 'delayed previously' for past delays now corrected, 'critical/other existing credit' for existing credits with issues or other problematic statuses, 'all paid' for all prior credits fully settled, and 'no credits/all paid' for no history or all prior credits paid. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status and approximate balance level of the individual's savings accounts or bonds, denominated in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the financial safety net or accumulated assets a person holds, which is a critical indicator of financial stability and risk. (categorical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating their current living arrangement (e.g., rent, own, or other forms of accommodation) (categorical)
- job: Job type of the applicant, categorized as unemployed/unskilled non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled, or highly skilled (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance or support. This is a numerical feature that can influence disposable income and credit risk. (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- checking_savings_encoded: A numerical feature engineered by combining an applicant's checking account status and savings account status into a single categorical code, designed to capture underlying patterns of financial stability and liquidity that may not be apparent when the two features are considered separately (numerical)
- credit_to_duration_ratio: The ratio of the requested credit amount to the loan duration in months, representing the monthly financial burden if the debt were evenly distributed; a higher value indicates a larger proportional commitment per month (numerical)
- job_housing_cross: Combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's occupational class and their housing situation, used to assess socio-economic stability and its influence on credit risk (categorical)
