You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit period from disbursement to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'all paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'existing paid' (existing credits paid duly so far), 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayments), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits with problematic history), and 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid). This indicates reliability in past debt repayment.
- **purpose**: The intended use of the requested loan funds, categorized into specific types such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, vacation, retraining, business, or other. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a key numerical indicator of the financial scale of the loan request. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and 1000 DM or more. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years of service: unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, representing ongoing financial obligations (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male divorced/separated, male married/widowed, and female single, divorced/separated, or married (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical: 'none', 'guarantor', or 'co-applicant').
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable property or asset owned by the applicant, which serves as a form of collateral or an indicator of financial stability (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or stores, such as for a car or appliance, which indicates existing debt obligations and repayment burden (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value represents the applicant's current level of active credit engagement with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Current employment type and residency status, categorized as unskilled non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled, or high-skilled/management. (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other family members, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no', which is used to assess stability and residency status (categorical)
- credit_amount_normalized: Standardized^credit^amount,^scaled^to^have^a^mean^of^zero^and^a^standard^deviation^of^one,^to^normalize^the^range^of^loan^values^and^improve^the^model's^convergence^and^sensitivity^across^differing^loan^sizes (numerical)
- employment_duration_encoded: A numerical encoding of the 'employment' feature, where categories representing employment duration ranges are mapped to ordinal values to facilitate quantitative analysis and measure correlation with the target variable. The encoding is typically ordered from shortest to longest employment duration. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Possible categories are: no checking account, a balance less than 0 DM (overdrawn), a balance between 0 and 200 DM, or a balance of 200 DM or more. This is a key indicator of the applicant's short-term financial liquidity and transaction history. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan period or credit agreement from origination to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit obligations, including payment punctuality, defaults, and existing credit arrangements (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include, but are not limited to, business, radio/television, used car, new car, furniture/equipment, domestic appliances, repairs, education, retraining, and other specific or general purposes. The purpose can indicate the risk profile of the loan, as some uses (e.g., business) may be considered more volatile than others (e.g., domestic appliances).
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This is a key numerical feature representing the financial scale of the transaction. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical variable with common tiers such as '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', and 'no known savings', reflecting the applicant's level of liquid assets. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges indicating the number of years with the present employer. The categories are: '<1' (less than one year), '1<=X<4' (one to under four years), '4<=X<7' (four to under seven years), and '>=7' (seven years or more). This is a categorical feature.
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is currently obligated to pay, representing ongoing financial liabilities (numerical integer)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/widowed, female divorced/separated/married, or male divorced/separated (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical: e.g., 'none', 'co-applicant', 'guarantor')
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence, indicating stability and roots in the community (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or property offered by the applicant as collateral or security for the credit. This is a categorical feature with values such as 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property'. (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant, representing their current life stage and associated financial responsibilities (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or retail stores, which may indicate existing debt obligations and financial commitments (categorical: 'none', 'bank', 'stores')
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential accommodation, which may influence stability and financial commitment. Common categories include 'rent', 'own' (owner-occupied), and 'for free' (e.g., living with family or provided by employer). (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same financial institution, including the one being applied for. This numerical value reflects the applicant's current debt obligations and ongoing credit relationships with the bank. (numerical)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and employment status (e.g., unskilled, skilled, management). (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other individuals, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This feature serves as a proxy for stability and traceability. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess immigration status and potential stability or legal duration of employment (categorical)
- credit_amount_normalized: A standardized (z-score normalized) numerical feature representing the original credit amount, transformed to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one across the dataset to improve model sensitivity and convergence by mitigating the influence of varying loan size scales (numerical)
- employment_duration_encoded: A numerical encoding of the categorical employment duration feature, where specific employment duration ranges (e.g., '<1 year', '1<=X<4 years', '4<=X<7 years', '>=7 years') are mapped to ordinal integer values. This transformation facilitates quantitative analysis, such as measuring correlation with the target variable or other numerical features, by representing the ordered categories on a continuous scale. (numerical)
- employment_stability_score: This engineered feature quantifies an applicant's socio-economic stability by combining encoded employment duration and residential tenure. It is calculated as the product of an employment duration code (where higher values indicate shorter, less stable employment) and the number of years at the current residence. A lower score suggests greater stability, as it reflects longer-term employment and a settled residential status, which are strong indicators of reduced risk for credit default. (numerical)
- credit_worthiness: This feature applies a logarithmic transformation to the normalized credit amount, which helps stabilize variance and normalize the distribution, making it more symmetrical and reducing the influence of extreme values. This transformation can improve model performance by enhancing sensitivity to proportional differences in credit size and supporting better convergence in algorithms that assume normally distributed data. (numerical)
- income_commitment_ratio: Calculates the ratio of the applicant's total credit installment commitments to their employment duration, providing insight into the proportion of their stable income that is already obligated to debt repayment. This metric helps assess financial burden and disposable income stability, which are crucial for evaluating repayment capacity and overall credit risk. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the agreed repayment period for the loan (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no checking' indicates no account, '<0' signifies a negative balance, '0<=X<200' represents a low positive balance, and '>=200' denotes a high positive balance. (categorical)
- savings_checking_combination: Integrates the categorical values of savings and checking account statuses into a single combined feature, providing a comprehensive view of an applicant's immediate financial resources and stability. This feature helps evaluate overall short-term liquidity, financial preparedness, and risk by capturing the interaction between savings levels and checking account conditions. (categorical)
- employment_stability_score: This feature is a composite numerical score derived from the applicant's current employment duration and their length of residence at their current address. It quantifies employment stability, where a higher value indicates greater perceived stability and reliability, as longer tenure in both job and residence often correlates with lower risk. This synthesized metric may improve prediction accuracy by consolidating these two stability-related factors into a single, more informative variable. (numerical)
- credit_amount_normalized: A standardized (z-score normalized) numerical feature derived from the original credit amount, which centers the data around zero with a unit standard deviation to improve model sensitivity and convergence by mitigating the influence of varying raw loan sizes and scales (numerical)
- credit_worthiness: This feature is a derived numerical value calculated by applying a natural logarithmic transformation (log(1 + x)) to the normalized credit amount. This transformation helps compress the scale of large credit values, making the overall distribution more symmetrical and reducing the influence of extreme outliers. It enhances model sensitivity to relative differences in credit size rather than absolute amounts, which can improve performance for algorithms assuming normally distributed data. The value is set to 'nan' when the base credit amount data is missing or invalid. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, categorized as 'existing paid' for current credits with no delinquencies, 'delayed previously' for past late payments, 'critical/other existing credit' for existing problematic credits or other negative statuses, 'existing paid' for satisfactorily maintained credits, or other specific historical patterns (categorical)
- employment_duration_encoded: A numerical encoding of the applicant's employment duration category, where 1 represents unemployed, 2 is less than 1 year, 3 is 1 to 4 years, 4 is 4 to 7 years, and 5 is 7 years or more, transformed for quantitative correlation analysis with other variables (numerical)
- duration_credit_score: A derived numerical score combining the loan duration (in months) with the applicant's credit worthiness, designed to evaluate how the length of the repayment period interacts with the applicant's overall credit risk profile. It assesses whether a longer loan term mitigates or amplifies risk, particularly for larger credit amounts, by modeling the relationship between time and financial stability. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment, in number of years, categorized into ranges indicating the applicant's length of employment with their current employer. (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- desc: The intended use of the loan funds, as declared by the applicant. This feature categorizes the primary economic objective of the credit, such as financing a vehicle, business investment, or consumer goods. It is a critical determinant of risk, as different purposes have varying associated default rates based on the underlying asset's value, liquidity, and the borrower's financial commitment to the goal.
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for the requested loan and any existing loans, expressed as a numerical value (integer). This represents the ongoing monthly financial obligation relative to income.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: The length of time, in months, for which the requested credit or loan is to be repaid. This represents the planned period of the financial obligation. (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking account', a negative balance ('<0'), a low positive balance ('0<=X<200'), or a substantial positive balance ('>=200'). (categorical)
- savings_checking_combination: A composite categorical feature that cross-references the client's savings account status with their checking account status, providing a unified assessment of immediate financial liquidity, stability, and risk exposure by combining two key short-term asset indicators. (categorical)
- employment_stability_score: This is a composite numerical score derived from the applicant's current employment duration and length of residence at their current address. It quantifies overall job and residential stability, where a higher value indicates greater stability and likely lower risk due to consistent income and settled living circumstances. This synthesized metric can be more predictive than either duration feature alone. (numerical)
- credit_amount_normalized: A standardized numerical transformation of the original credit amount, designed to rescale the loan value into a distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, thereby improving the model's sensitivity and convergence across varying loan sizes by mitigating the influence of the raw scale (numerical)
- credit_worthiness: This feature applies a logarithmic transformation to the normalized credit amount. This transformation helps normalize the distribution of credit amounts, making the data more symmetrical and reducing the impact of extreme values or skewness. It can improve model performance by enhancing sensitivity to relative differences in credit size rather than absolute differences, which is particularly useful for algorithms that assume normally distributed data. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical).
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayment, including timeliness and fulfillment of previous credit obligations (categorical)
- employment_duration_encoded: A numerical encoding of the applicant's current employment duration, where categories such as 'unemployed', '<1 year', '1<=X<4 years', '4<=X<7 years', and '>=7 years' are mapped to ordinal integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) to represent increasing job stability and allow for quantitative correlation analysis with the target variable. (numerical)
- duration_credit_score: A derived numerical feature that combines the loan duration (in months) with the applicant's credit worthiness score to evaluate how the length of the repayment period interacts with the borrower's overall credit profile. It assesses whether a longer loan term mitigates or amplifies risk when managing larger credit amounts, capturing the relationship between time and credit stability. Higher values may indicate a more favorable alignment of term and creditworthiness, while lower values suggest heightened risk. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the applicant's current employment duration in years, with classifications including unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)  
- description: The intended use of the requested loan funds, representing the applicant's stated primary objective for the credit. This categorical feature captures the economic or personal goal, such as financing a vehicle, household goods, education, or business expenses, which is a key factor in assessing the loan's risk and appropriateness.  
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, expressed as an integer category (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) where higher values indicate a greater portion of income is already obligated (categorical/ordinal).
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature indicates the level of financial reserves and liquidity available to the applicant. The categories represent specific monetary ranges: '<100' (less than 100 DM), '100<=X<500', '500<=X<1000', '>=1000' (1000 DM or more), and 'no known savings' for cases where no savings account or bonds are held. (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, such as those with banks or department stores, which may impact the applicant's overall debt burden and repayment capacity (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary borrower defaults. This categorical feature reflects the level of external financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has lived at their current residential address, indicating stability of residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most substantial asset or collateral offered by the applicant to secure the loan, which serves as a key risk-mitigating factor for the lender (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide ongoing support, such as children or other dependents (numerical integer)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this specific banking institution. This includes all active loans, credit lines, and other forms of credit, and serves as a direct indicator of the applicant's current debt obligations and credit exposure with this lender. (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their own name (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the credit or loan agreement (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. It indicates the account balance level and is a critical indicator of financial liquidity and transaction behavior. (categorical)
- savings_checking_combination: Integrates the categorical values of savings and checking account statuses to evaluate overall short-term liquidity and financial preparedness by creating a joint categorical variable that captures the combined financial profile of an applicant, which may reveal risk patterns not apparent when considering each account status in isolation. (categorical)
- employment_stability_score: This engineered feature combines the duration of current employment and the duration of residence at the current address into a composite numerical score. It quantifies the applicant's overall stability and rootedness, where a higher score indicates longer, uninterrupted periods in both employment and residence. This stability is a strong proxy for reliability and lower risk, as it suggests predictable income and life circumstances, thereby enhancing the model's ability to assess creditworthiness. (numerical)
- credit_amount_normalized: A standardized (z-score normalized) numerical feature representing the original credit amount, adjusted to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This transformation improves the model's sensitivity to different loan sizes by ensuring the scale of this feature is consistent with other numerical inputs, which aids in convergence and interpretability of coefficient magnitudes. (numerical)
- credit_worthiness: This feature is derived by applying a natural logarithmic transformation to the normalized credit amount. This transformation helps to reduce skewness in the distribution of credit values, making it more symmetrical and closer to a normal distribution. It enhances the model's ability to interpret relative differences in credit size, particularly useful when dealing with multiplicative relationships or wide-ranging values. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior in repaying debts, categorized by payment timeliness and completeness (categorical)
- employment_duration_encoded: A numerical encoding of the original categorical employment duration, where 0 represents unemployed or less than 1 year, 1 represents 1 to less than 4 years, 2 represents 4 to less than 7 years, and 3 represents 7 years or more. This transformation facilitates quantitative analysis, such as correlation studies with other financial risk factors. (numerical)
- duration_credit_score: Combines the loan duration (in months) with the applicant's credit worthiness or credit history to assess how the length of the repayment period interacts with their financial reliability. It evaluates whether a longer duration mitigates risk for applicants with weaker credit profiles or amplifies risk for larger credit amounts, capturing the temporal dimension of credit management capability. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment duration, categorized into ranges indicating the length of time the applicant has been with their current employer. The categories are: '<1' (less than 1 year), '1<=X<4' (1 to under 4 years), '4<=X<7' (4 to under 7 years), and '>=7' (7 or more years). (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)  
- desc: The intended use of the requested loan funds, categorized into specific economic or personal domains such as acquiring a vehicle, home appliances, education, business, or home improvement. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial goal and is critical for assessing the alignment of the loan with typical risk patterns associated with different spending categories.
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for the requested credit, expressed as a whole number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). This represents the ongoing financial burden the new loan would add relative to the applicant's available income. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, indicating the total amount held in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges or conditions, such as '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'unknown/no savings account'. (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's existing installment plans with other banks or retail stores, indicating concurrent debt obligations (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary borrower defaults. This categorical feature reflects the level of external financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker (yes) or a domestic worker (no) (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability of residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or property offered by the applicant as collateral or security for the credit. This is a categorical feature with classes such as 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property', and it is used to assess the applicant's financial stability and ability to secure the loan. (categorical)
- **num_dependents**: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide ongoing support and maintenance. This numerical feature directly influences disposable income and financial burden. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, representing their current debt obligations with the institution (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their own name. This is a categorical feature with possible values: 'yes' (has a telephone), 'none' (does not have a telephone). (categorical)
- purpose_encoded: A numerically encoded feature representing the purpose for which the credit is requested, such as a new car, business investment, or radio/television. This transformation from categorical to numerical values facilitates quantitative analysis, allowing for the measurement of statistical relationships and predictive correlations between the loan purpose and the target variable, such as credit risk or default likelihood. (numerical)
- employment_duration_stability: A composite numerical score that integrates the applicant's employment duration and residential stability, where a higher value indicates greater overall stability and reliability based on their employment history and length of residence at their current address. (numerical)
- savings_checking_interaction: A categorical feature that combines the client's savings account status and checking account status into a single interaction term. This combined variable is designed to capture the joint effect of a client's short-term and medium-term financial liquidity, providing a more holistic view of financial stability and risk exposure than either feature alone. (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: The length of time, in months, for which the credit loan is extended or scheduled to be repaid (numerical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, denominated in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with values indicating specific monetary ranges or conditions, such as 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or '>=200' (high balance). (categorical)
- savings_checking_combination: Integrates the categorical values of savings and checking account statuses to evaluate overall short-term liquidity and financial preparedness by creating a combined categorical feature that captures the interaction between a client's savings level (e.g., no known savings, <100, 100<=X<500, etc.) and checking account status (e.g., no checking, 0<=X<200, etc.). This provides a more holistic view of immediately accessible funds and financial stability than considering each account type in isolation. (categorical)
- employment_stability_score: This feature is a composite numerical score derived from the applicant's current employment duration and length of residence at their current address. It quantitatively assesses job and residential stability, where a higher value indicates greater perceived stability and lower risk, as longer tenure often correlates with reliability and reduced default probability. (numerical)
- credit_amount_normalized: A standardized (z-score) transformation of the original credit amount, which centers the data around zero with a unit standard deviation to normalize the scale, improve model sensitivity across different loan sizes, and facilitate faster convergence during training (numerical)
- credit_worthiness: This feature is derived by applying a natural logarithmic transformation (log(1 + x)) to the normalized credit amount. This transformation reduces skewness in the distribution of credit values, making it more symmetrical and less sensitive to extreme outliers. It enhances model performance by stabilizing variance and improving the interpretability of the relationship between credit size and the target variable. Missing values (nan) indicate cases where the transformation could not be applied, typically due to a zero or negative normalized input. (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical).
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayment, including timeliness and fulfillment of previous credit obligations (categorical)
- employment_duration_encoded: A numerical encoding of the original categorical employment duration feature, where each category is mapped to an ordinal integer value to quantify the duration for statistical and correlation analysis (numerical)
- duration_credit_score: A derived numerical feature that combines the loan duration (in months) with the applicant's credit worthiness or credit history score. It is designed to assess how the length of the loan term interacts with the applicant's credit profile to influence their perceived capability to manage and repay larger credit amounts. For instance, a longer duration might mitigate risk for applicants with certain credit histories by lowering periodic payments, thereby potentially stabilizing the overall credit risk impact. The value is calculated through a specific formula or scaling process, resulting in a continuous numerical score. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment duration, categorized into discrete ranges representing the applicant's length of employment with their current employer. The categories are: '<1' (less than one year), '1<=X<4' (one to under four years), '4<=X<7' (four to under seven years), and '>=7' (seven years or more). This is a categorical feature.
- **purpose**: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the loaned funds. Common categories include, for example, new car purchase, used car purchase, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, retraining, business creation, or other purposes. The purpose can influence risk assessment, as some loan types are associated with different likelihoods of repayment.
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for the requested loan, expressed as an integer categorical value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). This is a direct measure of the debt burden relative to income for the specific new credit being sought. (categorical integer)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature indicates the amount of money the applicant has saved, which serves as a key indicator of financial stability and capacity for debt repayment. The categories represent specific monetary ranges, such as '<100 DM', '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', and '>=1000 DM', as well as a category for 'unknown/no savings account'. (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans or payment agreements the applicant has with banks or retail stores, which may indicate existing financial commitments and repayment behavior (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties who are liable for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party security for the loan. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker (yes) or a domestic worker (no). This is a categorical feature used to assess potential stability and employment risk, as foreign worker status may be associated with different residency permits, job security, or length of stay in the country, which can influence credit risk. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, which is used as an indicator of stability and local community ties (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's collateral or property, which serves as security for the credit. This is a categorical feature with values such as 'real estate', 'car', 'no known property', or similar designations indicating the type and scale of assets owned. (categorical)
- num_dependents: The count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide ongoing maintenance and support. This numerical value directly impacts the assessment of disposable income and financial burden. (numerical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including loans and credit lines, which serves as an indicator of the applicant's existing debt burden and ongoing financial commitments with the institution (numerical integer)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This feature serves as a proxy for stability, traceability, and personal infrastructure. (categorical: 'yes', 'no')
- purpose_encoded: A numerical encoding of the loan purpose category (e.g., car, furniture, business), which allows the model to process the categorical purpose information quantitatively and identify statistical relationships between specific loan purposes and credit risk outcomes. (numerical)
- employment_duration_stability: A composite numerical score derived from the applicant's current employment duration and residential stability, where higher values indicate a more stable and established personal and professional history, which is a strong positive indicator for creditworthiness. (numerical)
- savings_checking_interaction: A composite categorical feature representing the joint state of an applicant's savings account and checking account. It captures the interaction between these two key liquidity indicators, which is often more predictive of financial stability and risk than either feature alone. Common categories include combinations like '>=1000_0<=X<200' (high savings with a low-positive checking balance) or '<100_no checking' (low savings with no checking account), helping to identify nuanced profiles of cash availability and banking behavior. (categorical)
