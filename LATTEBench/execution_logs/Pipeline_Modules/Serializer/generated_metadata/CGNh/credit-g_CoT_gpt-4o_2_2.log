Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Possible values are: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan agreement or credit period (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'no credits/all paid' for no history or all prior credits paid duly, 'all paid' for all existing credits paid back as agreed, 'existing paid' for current credits in good standing, 'delayed previously' for past delays in repayment, and 'critical/other existing credit' for existing credits with critical payment history or other problematic statuses. (categorical)
- **purpose**: The intended use of the requested loan funds, categorized into specific domains such as a car, business investment, education, furniture/equipment, radio/television, home appliances, repairs, vacation, retraining, or other (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the approximate balance range: 'no known savings' (no savings account or bonds), '<100 DM' (balance under 100 DM), '100<=X<500 DM' (balance between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000 DM' (balance between 500 and 999 DM), and '>=1000 DM' (balance of 1000 DM or more). (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account's balance range or absence: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- savings_checking_combined: Combined categorical indicator of the applicant's total liquid assets across both savings and checking accounts, used to evaluate overall short-term financial stability and liquidity risk (categorical)
- name: Unique identifier for the individual credit application (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- **purpose**: Purpose of the credit, indicating the intended use of the requested loan funds. This is a categorical feature with common values including 'radio/tv' (for electronics/appliances), 'business', 'furniture/equipment', 'car', 'education', 'repairs', and 'domestic appliances', among others. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account and bonds held by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the approximate level of the applicant's liquid savings and investments, which is a key indicator of financial stability and capacity to handle debt. (categorical)
- credit_burden_ratio: Ratio of the required monthly installment commitment to the total monthly credit amount, representing the proportion of monthly credit income allocated to debt repayment, used to assess the borrower's immediate financial burden and repayment pressure (numerical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or are in other living arrangements such as living for free (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, categorized by the primary institution holding the plan. This includes plans with banks (for loans or financing) and plans with stores (for retail or consumer credit). A 'none' category indicates the applicant has no other outstanding installment debts. (categorical)
- credit_per_month: Monthly installment amount for the credit, calculated as the total credit amount divided by the duration in months, representing the borrower's average monthly repayment burden (numerical)
- residence_since: Duration of residence at the current address in years, indicating stability and local ties (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced, separated) combined with gender (male, female) as a composite categorical variable (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, not including the new credit being applied for (numerical integer)
- installment_commitment: Number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, not including the current application (integer)

2025-12-18 11:22:32,026 - INFO - LLM Output: Generating features using feature engineering can significantly improve the prediction capabilities of a model. Below are three potential steps to create new features using the given operators:

1. <checking_status_savings_status_cross><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Cross of checking account status and savings account status to analyze comprehensive financial behavior patterns>
   - Reasoning: Combining checking account status and savings account status through a cross operation provides insight into the applicant's overall liquidity and financial behavior. This feature could reveal important patterns or risks associated with creditworthiness, as certain combinations may indicate stronger or weaker financial stability.

2. <credit_history_residence_since_ratio><ratio><credit_history_stability><residence_since><Ratio of credit history stability to years of residence to assess long-term reliability and commitment>
   - Reasoning: This feature creates a ratio comparing the applicant’s credit history stability to the duration of their residence. Applicants with stable credit histories who have lived at their current address for a longer period may show stronger reliability and commitment, potentially reducing the risk of default.

3. <duration_label_encoded><label_encode><duration><Numerical encoding of loan duration as a quantifiable measure>
   - Reasoning: Label encoding the loan duration transforms the categorical perception of time into a numerical representation. This can be especially useful for integrating duration as a feature across various feature engineering steps that require a numerical input, facilitating complex interactions with other features and improving model scalability and understanding.

2025-12-18 11:23:33,996 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_stability_encoded><label_encode><credit_history_stability><Numerical encoding of credit history stability to quantify overall credit risk>
   
   Reasoning: Encoding the 'credit_history_stability' feature numerically can help the model assess the risk associated with both past credit repayment behavior and employment stability. This enhances the model's ability to predict potential defaults based on historical trends and current job situation.

2. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Cross of checking and savings account status to analyze combined financial behavior>

   Reasoning: By examining the interaction between checking and savings account statuses, this feature provides insights into the applicant's liquidity and financial behavior, potentially indicating their capacity to handle additional credit responsibilities.

3. <duration_scaled><minmax><duration><Scaled version of credit duration to normalize and compare loan commitment periods>

   Reasoning: Using min-max scaling on the 'duration' feature can standardize credit durations, facilitating better comparison across different loan periods and improving the model's understanding of loan term impacts on credit approval probabilities.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Possible categories include: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial balance). This is a key indicator of financial liquidity and transaction behavior. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- savings_checking_combined: A composite categorical feature representing the combined status of an applicant's savings account and checking account, designed to provide a holistic view of immediate financial liquidity and stability by integrating two key indicators of available assets and transaction history. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit, indicating the intended use of the requested loan funds (categorical). Categories include radio/tv, car, business, education, furniture/equipment, renovations, and others.
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, <100 DM, 100 <= ... < 500 DM, 500 <= ... < 1000 DM, and >=1000 DM. (categorical)
- credit_burden_ratio: The proportion of the monthly installment commitment relative to the total monthly credit amount, quantifying the immediate financial burden of the loan repayment (numerical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- credit_history: Categorical feature describing the applicant's past repayment behavior with other creditors, including categories such as 'existing paid', 'critical/other existing credit', 'delayed previously', 'all paid', and 'no credits/all paid' (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans or loans the applicant has, categorized as being with banks, stores, or having none. This indicates existing debt obligations that could affect repayment capacity. (categorical)
- credit_per_month: Monthly credit amount, representing the average credit burden per month, calculated as the total credit amount divided by the loan duration in months (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male married or widowed, female divorced/separated/married, and female single (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of active credit lines or loans the applicant currently holds at this specific bank, excluding the new credit being applied for (numerical integer)
- installment_commitment: Number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, excluding the new loan being considered (numerical)
- employment_stability: A numerical encoding representing the applicant's employment stability, where higher values typically indicate longer tenure or more secure employment (e.g., 0 = unemployed, 1 = less than 1 year, 2 = 1–4 years, 3 = 4–7 years, 4 = 7+ years), used to assess the risk associated with job security (numerical)
- credit_history_stability: A composite categorical feature formed by crossing the applicant's credit history with their employment stability. It is designed to analyze the combined risk associated with an individual's pattern of employment (e.g., stable, unstable) and their historical behavior in repaying credit (e.g., existing paid, critical/other existing credit). This interaction helps identify subgroups where unstable employment may exacerbate the risk indicated by a poor credit history, or where stable employment may mitigate the risk of a mediocre credit record. (categorical)
- credit_instalment_ratio: The ratio of the total credit amount to the number of installment commitments, calculated as credit_amount divided by installment_commitment. This metric assesses the borrower's repayment manageability by indicating the average credit burden per installment, where a higher ratio suggests a larger financial obligation per payment period (numerical)
- savings_checking_stability: A composite categorical feature combining an applicant's savings status and their credit history stability. It is designed to evaluate the joint effect of liquid asset availability and historical credit behavior on overall financial risk. Each value represents a specific combination (e.g., '<100_all paid_3'), where the first part indicates the savings/checking level, the second part denotes the credit history category, and the final number often references employment stability or another risk-related code from the original dataset.
- employment_credit_risk: A composite categorical feature combining employment stability and credit history, designed to assess the synergistic risk from an applicant's job security and past credit repayment behavior. It captures interactions such as unstable employment with poor credit history, which may indicate higher default probability (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance level in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no checking account, a balance less than 0 DM (overdrawn), a balance between 0 and 200 DM, and a balance of 200 DM or more. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- savings_checking_combined: A categorical feature that combines the status of both savings and checking accounts into a single composite indicator, designed to provide a more holistic assessment of an applicant's overall financial stability and liquidity by evaluating the joint condition of their primary transactional and savings balances. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- **name: purpose** (categorical)  
- **purpose: Purpose of the credit** – This feature describes the intended use of the loan funds. It is a categorical variable that classifies the primary reason for the credit application, such as acquiring a new car, financing a business venture, pursuing education, or purchasing household appliances. The purpose helps assess the risk and appropriateness of the loan based on how the funds will be deployed.
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the total liquid savings held, which is a key indicator of financial stability and ability to withstand financial shocks. (categorical)
- credit_burden_ratio: The proportion of the monthly installment commitment relative to the total monthly credit amount, quantifying the immediate financial burden of the loan payment relative to the credit extended (numerical)
- housing: Type of housing accommodation the applicant currently resides in, including categories such as renting, home ownership, or living rent-free (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including repayment patterns and any defaults or delinquencies (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's concurrent installment plans with other institutions, such as banks or retail stores. This indicates existing debt obligations that could affect repayment capacity. (categorical)
- credit_per_month: Monthly credit amount, representing the average credit burden per month, calculated as the total credit amount divided by the loan duration in months (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, female div/dep/mar (divorced/separated/widowed), male mar/wid (married/widowed), and female single (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of active credit accounts (such as loans or credit lines) the applicant currently holds at this specific bank, which is used to assess the applicant's current debt load and credit activity with the institution (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment-based credits or loans the applicant is committed to, where an installment credit is a loan repaid with a fixed number of scheduled payments (numerical)
- employment_stability: A numerical encoding representing the applicant's employment status, where higher values typically indicate greater job stability and security, such as long-term employment with the current employer, while lower values indicate less stability, such as unemployment or short-term employment (numerical)
- credit_history_stability: A composite categorical feature merging an applicant's credit history with their employment stability. It assesses the combined risk by evaluating patterns in past credit repayment behavior (e.g., existing paid, critical/other existing credit) alongside the consistency of employment, as unstable employment coupled with poor credit history may indicate a higher probability of default. (categorical)
- credit_instalment_ratio: Ratio of the total credit amount to the number of installment commitments, indicating the average credit burden per installment and used to assess repayment manageability and financial strain (numerical)
- savings_checking_stability: A categorical feature representing the combined interaction of an applicant's savings/checking account status and their credit history stability. This cross-tabulation assesses the compounded financial risk by evaluating the stability of available liquid assets alongside the consistency of past credit repayment behavior, providing a more nuanced profile than either feature alone. (categorical)
- employment_credit_risk: A composite categorical feature representing the combined risk profile derived from an applicant's employment stability and their credit history. It assesses the potential default risk by evaluating the interaction between job security (employment_stability) and the reliability of past debt repayment (credit_history). Each unique combination of the two base features forms a distinct risk category. (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:26:34,526 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<savings_credit_interaction\>\<cross\>\<savings_status\>\<credit_history\>\<Cross-interaction between savings status and credit history to evaluate how past repayment behavior affects savings behavior\>

   Reasoning: By creating a cross-interaction feature between savings status and credit history, we can assess the risk profile considering both the applicant’s savings behavior and their past credit repayment patterns. This combined feature could provide a more comprehensive picture of an applicant's financial responsibility and predict creditworthiness.

2. \<loan_purpose_impact\>\<label_encode\>\<purpose\>\<Numerical encoding of loan purpose to quantify the risk associated with different purposes of credit\>

   Reasoning: Transforming the categorical purpose of the loan into a numerical format allows us to quantify the potential risk impact of different purposes, such as whether loans for business ventures are riskier compared to those for personal consumption. This could enhance the model's ability to differentiate applicants based on the intended use of the funds.

3. \<financial_stability_score\>\<cross\>\<savings_status\>\<checking_status\>\<Combining the savings and checking account statuses into a single feature to evaluate overall financial stability\>

   Reasoning: Financial stability is a crucial factor in credit approval decisions. By combining savings and checking account statuses, this feature provides a holistic view of an applicant's liquidity and ability to manage finances. This could significantly improve predictions by identifying stable financial patterns in applicants.

- credit_instalment_ratio: The ratio of the total credit amount to the number of installment commitments, calculated to evaluate the borrower's repayment manageability by indicating the average credit burden per installment commitment (numerical)
- savings_checking_stability: Cross-tabulation of savings status with credit history stability, capturing the interaction between a client's liquid asset levels and their historical repayment behavior to assess the combined financial risk profile (categorical)
- employment_credit_risk: A composite categorical feature formed by combining 'employment_stability' and 'credit_history'. It evaluates the joint risk profile of an applicant by considering both their job security (employment stability) and their track record in repaying previous debts (credit history). This cross-feature helps identify high-risk combinations, such as unstable employment paired with a poor credit history, or low-risk combinations, such as stable employment with a fully repaid credit history. (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:27:38,361 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given data, I'll suggest three feature engineering steps that might improve the model's predictive performance:

1. Combine Existing Credits with Duration to Assess Credit Load Across Time  
   <credit_load_per_year><divide><existing_credits><duration><Ratio of the number of existing credits to the loan duration to assess credit load over time>

   *Reasoning*: This feature aims to quantify the applicant's existing credit commitments relative to the loan duration, providing insight into how spread their existing financial obligations are over time.

2. Assess Risk by Cross-combining Credit History and Personal Status  
   <credit_personal_risk><cross><credit_history><personal_status><Combining credit history with personal status to evaluate how individual circumstances might moderate credit behavior risks>

   *Reasoning*: Personal status, coupled with credit history, may provide a nuanced understanding of creditworthiness. For instance, the risk profiles of a single male and a married female might differ even if they have similar credit histories, due to different socio-economic factors affecting repayment behavior.

3. Cross Credit Burden and Housing Status to Understand Financial Pressure  
   <financial_pressure_index><cross><credit_burden_ratio><housing><Cross feature to represent the financial pressure of housing costs and credit burden on the applicant>

   *Reasoning*: Combining the ratio of monthly installment commitments with the applicant’s housing status gives insight into their financial well-being. Renters may have different financial pressures compared to homeowners, impacting their ability to repay loans.

These features are designed to encapsulate complex interactions and behaviors in a simplistic manner, potentially allowing the model to understand nuanced details correlating loan application performance with personal financial behaviors.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in ranges of Deutsche Mark (DM) balance or as a special category for no account. Categories include: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). This feature indicates short-term liquidity and transaction behavior. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- savings_checking_combined: Combined categorical feature representing the interaction of an applicant's checking and savings account statuses, used to assess overall short-term financial stability and liquidity by evaluating the combined balances across both account types (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the credit agreement or loan term (numerical)
- **purpose**: Purpose for which the credit is requested, categorized into specific types such as 'radio/tv', 'business', 'education', etc. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the approximate balance range: 'no known savings' (no verifiable account), '<100 DM' (low balance), '100 <= ... < 500 DM' (moderate balance), '500 <= ... < 1000 DM' (substantial balance), and '>=1000 DM' (high balance). This feature reflects the applicant's available liquid reserves. (categorical)
- credit_burden_ratio: The proportion of the required monthly installment payment relative to the total monthly credit amount, quantifying the immediate financial strain of the loan obligation on the borrower's monthly budget (numerical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating their current living arrangement (e.g., rent, own, or for free) (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, categorized by payment timeliness and existing credit standing (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or retail stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- credit_per_month: Monthly credit installment amount, representing the fixed periodic payment the applicant is obligated to make for this credit, calculated by dividing the total credit amount by the loan duration in months (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating marital status (e.g., male single, male married/widowed, female single, female div/sep/married) as a combined categorical feature.
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including loans and credit lines. This numerical value reflects the applicant's current level of credit engagement and potential debt obligations with the institution. (numerical)
- installment_commitment: Number of existing installment commitments (loans) for which the applicant is currently responsible (integer)
- employment_stability: A numerical encoding representing the applicant's current employment status, where higher values typically indicate greater job stability and tenure, such as permanent employment or long-term service with the same employer, while lower values suggest less stability, such as temporary work, unemployment, or short employment history (numerical)
- credit_history_stability: A composite categorical feature that captures the interaction between an applicant's credit history and their employment stability. It is designed to analyze the combined risk profile by assessing how patterns of past credit repayment (e.g., existing paid, critical/other existing credit, all paid) intersect with the applicant's current employment tenure and job security (e.g., stable, unstable, or varying durations). This feature helps identify heightened risk scenarios where problematic credit behavior coincides with unstable employment, or conversely, where good credit history aligns with stable employment, providing a more nuanced view of default probability. (categorical)
- credit_instalment_ratio: Ratio of the total credit amount to the number of installment commitments, indicating the average debt per installment and assessing the borrower's repayment manageability and per-payment burden (numerical)
- savings_checking_stability: A composite categorical feature representing the joint state of an applicant's short-term liquidity and credit repayment trend. It is derived by cross-referencing the 'savings_status' (indicating level of reserves in savings accounts) with 'credit_history_stability' (a combined feature of historical credit behavior and recent employment stability). This feature directly models the interaction between asset availability and credit conduct to provide a unified assessment of financial reliability and risk of default.
- employment_credit_risk: Combined categorical feature derived from employment stability and credit history, designed to assess the integrated risk profile of an applicant by evaluating both job security and historical credit repayment behavior. It captures interactions between these two dimensions to identify higher-risk segments (categorical)
