Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with values indicating specific monetary thresholds or conditions: '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '>=200' (high positive balance), or 'no checking' (no account). (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the existing checking account, categorized as '<0' for negative balance, '0<=X<200' for low positive balance, etc. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, expressed as a numerical value. This represents the ongoing debt burden relative to available income. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and greater than or equal to 1000 DM. (categorical)

- job: Current employment classification, categorized as unemployed/unskilled non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled, or high skilled/management (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates if there are other parties (co-applicant or guarantor) associated with the credit application, categorized as none or co applicant (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical encoding of the credit_history feature, where each category is mapped to an integer value (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates if the borrower has a telephone in their name, categorized as none or yes (categorical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and residency status (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are other parties (such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors) associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of additional security or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical encoding of the applicant's credit history category, where each discrete category (e.g., 'existing paid', 'delayed previously') is mapped to a specific integer value to facilitate model processing (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible values: 'yes' signifies the applicant has a telephone, which may be associated with greater stability and verifiability; 'none' signifies the applicant does not have a telephone in their name.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with values that typically represent ranges such as '<0 DM' (negative balance), '0<=X<200 DM', '>=200 DM', or 'no checking account'. (categorical)

- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- normalized_credit_amount: The original credit amount, normalized to a continuous numerical scale between 0 and 1 using a min-max or similar scaling method, which preserves the distribution's shape while allowing for direct comparison across features by removing the influence of the original value range (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's checking account, indicating the balance level (categorical: <0, 0<=X<200, >=200, no checking)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- installment_commitment: Installment rate as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account or bonds, indicating the balance level (categorical: <100, 100<=X<500, 500<=X<1000, >=1000, no known savings)
- credit_history: Applicant's past credit behavior and repayment history (categorical: critical/other existing credit, existing paid, delayed previously, no credits/all paid)

   Reasoning: Age and savings status might have a combined effect on an individual's financial stability and likelihood to receive credit. Older individuals with higher savings might be perceived as more creditworthy.

2. \<installment_income_ratio\>\<divide\>\<installment_commitment\>\<age\>\<Ratio_of_installment_commitment_to_age_to_assess_financial_burden_relative_to_age\>

   Reasoning: This feature evaluates the financial burden of installment payments in relation to the applicant's age. Younger individuals with higher installment burdens might be at a disadvantage when applying for credit.

3. \<foreign_worker_credit_history\>\<cross\>\<foreign_worker\>\<credit_history_encoded\>\<Interaction_between_foreign_worker_status_and_credit_history_to_gauge_effect_on_credit_decision\>

   Reasoning: Foreign worker status combined with credit history might influence credit decisions due to perceived risk factors associated with credit management by foreign nationals.

   _Reasoning_: This interaction captures the combined influence of employment type and property ownership on creditworthiness. Different job types may imply varying degrees of financial stability, which, when combined with property held, could provide a better signal for credit decisions.

2. <savings_duration_ratio><divide><savings_status><duration><Ratio_of_savings_to_duration_to_assess_how_savings_can_support_loan_payment_over_time>

   _Reasoning_: By examining the ratio of savings status to loan duration, we can assess how well the applicant's savings can cover the loan over its duration. This feature can indicate financial preparedness for the credit period.

3. <phone_and_foreign_worker_combination><cross><own_telephone><foreign_worker><Interaction_between_telephone_ownership_and_foreign_worker_status_to_capture_combined_impact_on_creditworthiness>

   _Reasoning_: This feature combines phone ownership with foreign worker status to evaluate their joint effect. Telephone ownership suggests stability and reachability, while foreign worker status might entail different financial behaviors and risks, making their interaction potentially informative for credit decisions.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: negative ('<0'), zero to under 200 DM ('0<=X<200'), 200 DM or more ('>=200'), or no checking account ('no checking'). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan period or credit agreement (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for existing loans, expressed as an integer categorical value (e.g., 1 for low, 4 for high) representing an ordered category (categorical ordinal)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of known savings: '<100 DM', '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', and 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'existing paid' (no outstanding debts, all credits paid duly), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits at other institutions or a critical credit history), 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayments), and other relevant historical payment statuses. (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The type and relative value of the applicant's collateral or assets offered to secure the loan, categorized as real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- normalized_credit_amount: Normalization of the original credit amount to a continuous numerical scale between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the minimum credit amount in the dataset and 1 represents the maximum, performed to standardize the feature's range and improve comparability and model performance by mitigating the influence of varying scales (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no'. This is a categorical feature that may influence credit risk assessment due to differing employment stability, residency status, or regulatory considerations. (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, such as children or other family members, for whom the applicant is legally and financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and residency status (e.g., unskilled, skilled, management). (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of additional individuals who have co-signed or guaranteed the credit obligation, serving as secondary sources of repayment. Categories include: 'none' (no other parties involved), 'guarantor' (a third-party guarantor is present), or 'co-applicant' (a joint applicant is on the credit agreement). (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical encoding derived from the original 'credit_history' categorical feature, where each distinct category (e.g., 'critical/other existing credit', 'existing paid') is mapped to a specific integer value to facilitate model processing, as indicated by the sample value of 3 corresponding to 'existing paid'. (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with possible values of 'none' (no telephone) or 'yes' (has a telephone). (categorical)
- job_property_magnitude_interaction: An engineered categorical feature representing the combined effect of an applicant's occupational category and the scale of their property assets, created to capture non-linear interactions that may influence credit risk assessment beyond the individual features alone (categorical)
- phone_and_foreign_worker_combination: Interaction feature combining the 'own_telephone' and 'foreign_worker' categories into a single composite variable, designed to capture any synergistic or non-additive effects that the combination of telephone ownership status and foreign worker status may have on credit risk assessment (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges: 'no checking' indicates no account, '<0' signifies a negative balance, '0<=X<200' represents a low positive balance, and '>=200' indicates a substantial balance of at least 200 DM. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan repayment period (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, expressed as a numerical value (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions: '<100 DM' for balances under 100 DM, '100<=X<500 DM' for balances between 100 and 500 DM, '500<=X<1000 DM' for balances between 500 and 1000 DM, '>=1000 DM' for balances of 1000 DM or more, and 'no known savings' for cases where no savings or bonds are declared or known.

This indicates reliability in meeting past financial obligations. (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or collateral, which serves as a key indicator of asset-backed security for the loan (categorical). Examples include 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property'.
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- normalized_credit_amount: A numerical feature representing the original credit amount after min-max normalization, scaled to a continuous range between 0 and 1 to ensure uniformity and improve comparability with other features in the model (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable used to assess potential residency stability and employment authorization status (categorical)
- num_dependents: The total count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical integer).
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled, or highly skilled (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of any additional parties involved in the credit agreement, specifically other debtors or guarantors who share responsibility for the loan (categorical: 'none', 'guarantor', or 'co-applicant').
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical encoding of the applicant's credit history category, where each original descriptive category (e.g., 'critical/other existing credit', 'existing paid') is mapped to a distinct integer value to facilitate model processing (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their own name. This is a categorical feature with values 'yes' for having a telephone or 'none' for not having one. (categorical)
- job_property_magnitude_interaction: A categorical interaction feature engineered by combining the 'job' and 'property_magnitude' attributes. It captures non-linear and combined effects that the intersection of an applicant's employment category and the scale of their collateral may have on credit risk assessment, which might not be evident when the two features are considered independently. Examples from the data include values like "skilled_car" and "unskilled resident_car". (categorical)
- phone_and_foreign_worker_combination: A composite categorical feature representing the joint status of the applicant's telephone ownership and foreign worker classification, engineered to capture potential synergistic or moderating effects that this combination may have on perceived stability and credit risk assessment (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_savings_interaction: A derived categorical feature representing the combined status of a client's checking and savings accounts, created to capture their interactive effect on perceived financial stability and liquidity risk. It encodes specific pairings (e.g., 'no checking_<100') that may indicate a higher risk profile than either feature alone. (categorical)
- credit_duration_ratio: Ratio of the normalized credit amount to the loan duration, quantifying the monthly or periodic financial burden relative to the total credit extended, used to assess repayment capability and risk over the loan term (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's existing property or collateral, which can include real estate, a life insurance policy, a car, or indicate no known property (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months of the credit loan, representing the agreed repayment period (numerical)
- normalized_credit_amount: The original credit amount scaled to a continuous numerical range between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the minimum credit amount in the dataset and 1 represents the maximum, enabling standardized comparison and mitigating the influence of the feature's original scale on model performance (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as existing paid (all previous credits paid duly), critical/other existing credit (delayed payments or other problematic credit history), existing paid this bank (all credits at this bank paid duly), or no credits/all paid (no previous credits or all previously taken credits paid back duly) (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no checking' indicates no account, '<0' indicates a negative balance, '0<=X<200' indicates a low positive balance, and '>=200' indicates a substantial balance. This is a key indicator of short-term financial liquidity. (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical encoding representing the applicant's historical credit behavior, where specific categorical assessments such as 'all paid' or 'delayed previously' are mapped to discrete integer values to facilitate algorithmic processing (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the total liquid savings held across all relevant accounts. (categorical)
- job_property_magnitude_interaction: A composite categorical feature representing the combined effect of an applicant's employment category and the scale of their owned assets, which may reveal nuanced risk profiles not captured by the individual features alone (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name. This is a categorical feature with possible values of 'yes' or 'none', where 'yes' signifies the presence of a personal telephone line and 'none' indicates no telephone is registered to the applicant. (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of additional parties involved in the credit application, specifically other debtors or guarantors who share responsibility for the loan (categorical: 'none', 'guarantor', 'co-applicant')
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer).
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and employment status (e.g., unskilled, skilled, management). (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess employment stability and residency status (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- age_residence_interaction: Interaction term calculated as the product of the applicant's age in years and the number of years they have resided at their current address, designed to capture combined effects on perceived stability, reliability, and life-stage anchoring that may influence credit risk (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_savings_interaction: A derived categorical feature representing the combined status of a client's checking and savings accounts, created to capture their synergistic effect on perceived financial stability and liquidity risk. It encodes specific pairings of the original 'checking_status' and 'savings_status' values (e.g., '<0_<100', 'no checking_<100') as a single interaction term. (categorical)
- credit_duration_ratio: Ratio of the normalized credit amount to the loan duration, quantifying the monthly or periodic financial burden relative to the total credit, used to assess repayment capability and risk over the loan term (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type of valuable asset the applicant has pledged as collateral for the credit, categorized as real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months (numerical). This feature represents the length of the loan or credit agreement, measured as the total number of months for which the credit will be extended or the installment plan will run. A longer duration typically implies smaller periodic payments but a greater total cost of credit due to extended interest accrual.
- normalized_credit_amount: The credit amount normalized to a continuous scale between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the smallest credit amount in the dataset and 1 represents the largest, enabling improved comparability and model performance by reducing the influence of the feature's original scale (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and existing credit obligations (categorical: 'no credits/all paid', 'all paid', 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', or 'critical/other existing credit')
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Possible categories include: no checking account, a negative balance ("<0"), a low positive balance ("0 <= ... < 200"), or a substantial positive balance (">=200"). (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical encoding of the applicant's credit history category, where specific qualitative assessments such as 'all paid', 'critical/other existing credit', or 'existing paid' are mapped to discrete integer values to facilitate algorithmic processing (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, indicating the total balance in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges: no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and greater than or equal to 1000 DM. This feature reflects the applicant's available liquid assets and financial buffer. (categorical)
- job_property_magnitude_interaction: A categorical interaction feature combining the applicant's occupational category and the type of collateral provided, designed to capture non-linear and synergistic effects on credit risk assessment that may not be evident when considering each feature independently. It encodes specific pairings such as 'unemp/unskilled non res_real estate' or 'skilled_life insurance' to model how employment stability interacts with asset quality in determining loan repayment probability. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line. This is a categorical feature with values 'yes' (has a telephone) or 'none' (does not have a telephone). (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature indicates whether the applicant has co-signers, joint debtors, or guarantors who share responsibility for the loan, which influences the lender's risk assessment by evaluating alternative sources for repayment. (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer).
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, which influences perceived income stability and repayment reliability (categorical: 'unemp/unskilled non res', 'unskilled resident', 'skilled', 'high qualif/self emp/mgmt')
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- age_residence_interaction: The multiplicative product of the applicant's age in years and the duration of their current residence in years, designed to capture combined effects on perceived stability, reliability, and life-stage anchoring, which may influence credit risk assessment (numerical)

2025-12-18 11:51:46,954 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <savings_checking_stability_cross><cross><savings_status><checking_status><Combining_savings_and_checking_accounts_to_assess_financial_stability_and_liquidity>
   - Reasoning: This feature can capture the combined financial stability and liquidity of an individual by analyzing both savings and checking account statuses together, potentially improving the model's ability to predict creditworthiness. Though similar interactions have been tried before, the focus on combined liquidity specifics could offer new insights.

2. <credit_age_sqrt><sqrt><age><Applying_square_root_transformation_to_age_to_handle_nonlinearity_and_variability_in_age_distribution>
   - Reasoning: By applying a square root transformation to the age feature, we can manage potential non-linear relationships and variability within the age distribution. This transformation can reduce skewness and normalize variance, improving the model prediction's stability across different age demographics.

3. <loan_burden_by_commitment><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Assessing_loan_burden_relative_to_existing_installment_commitments>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to understand the context of the loan burden in relation to the applicant's existing installment commitments, providing insights into the additional financial pressure introduced by the new credit application.

2025-12-18 11:52:36,365 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_savings_interaction: A categorical interaction feature engineered by combining the 'checking_status' and 'savings_status' attributes. It captures the synergistic effect of a client's short-term transaction account liquidity and medium-term savings holdings on their perceived financial stability and credit risk, which may not be fully represented by either feature in isolation. (categorical)
- credit_duration_ratio: Ratio of the normalized credit amount to the loan duration, quantifying the monthly or periodic repayment burden relative to the total credit size, used to assess the borrower's debt density and long-term repayment capability (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of assets or collateral the applicant has declared, which serves as security for the credit (e.g., 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property') (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months of the loan or credit arrangement (numerical)
- normalized_credit_amount: The credit amount requested by the applicant, normalized to a continuous numerical scale between 0 and 1 using a min-max or similar scaling method to ensure comparability with other features and mitigate the influence of its original wide numerical range (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment history and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical encoding of the applicant's categorical credit history, where specific historical credit behaviors are mapped to integer values to facilitate model processing, with the exact mapping (e.g., 1 for 'critical/other existing credit', 3 for 'existing paid', 4 for 'no credits/all paid') derived from the original categorical feature (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include no savings, very low savings (<100 DM), low to moderate savings (100–500 DM, 500–1000 DM), and substantial savings (≥1000 DM). This feature reflects the applicant's available liquid reserves. (categorical)
- job_property_magnitude_interaction: A categorical interaction feature combining the applicant's occupational category and the scale of their available property or collateral. It is designed to capture non-linear, combined effects on credit risk that may not be apparent when considering job status and property magnitude in isolation, as certain profession and asset combinations may indicate distinct levels of financial stability or repayment capacity. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible states: 'yes' if a telephone is registered, or 'none' if no telephone is registered. (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This indicates whether the applicant's liability is shared or guaranteed by another party, which impacts risk assessment. (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's current chronological age (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer)
- job: Job classification of the applicant, indicating their employment type and skill level (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess employment stability and residency status (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- age_residence_interaction: Interaction term calculated as the product of the applicant's age (in years) and the duration of their current residence (in years), designed to capture combined effects on perceived stability, life-stage reliability, and long-term commitment, which may influence credit risk assessment (numerical)

2025-12-18 11:52:41,544 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <age_installment_interaction><multiply><age><installment_commitment><Interaction_between_age_and_installment_commitment_to_assess_joint_effect_on_creditworthiness>

   Reasoning: This interaction captures the compounded effect of a borrower's age and the number of active installment commitments, providing insight into how loan obligations weigh against the age-related income and stability expectations. It may help identify borrowers with excessive burdens relative to their life stage.

2. <foreign_worker_property_interaction><cross><foreign_worker><property_magnitude><Creation_of_an_interaction_feature_between_foreign_worker_status_and_property_magnitude_to_capture_combined_effects_on_collateral_ownership_and_credit_risk>

   Reasoning: By cross-referencing the foreign worker status with the declared property magnitude, this feature can expose specific risks or benefits associated with being a foreign worker who owns or does not own assets. This composite measure helps to capture nuanced financial profiles that might influence credit decisions.

3. <savings_credit_ratio><divide><normalized_credit_amount><savings_status_label_encoded><Ratio_of_normalized_credit_amount_to_label_encoded_savings_status_to_assess_credit_amount_relative_to_savings_liquidity>

   Reasoning: This feature aims to quantify the proportion of the credit amount in relation to the applicant's savings level. By comparing the normalized credit request to an encoded savings status, it can provide an indication of how much of a resource strain the credit request represents based on available liquid reserves. This can be crucial in evaluating financial resilience and risk.
