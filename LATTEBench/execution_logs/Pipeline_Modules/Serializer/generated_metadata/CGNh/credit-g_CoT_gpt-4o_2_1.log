Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan agreement or the planned period for repayment (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'existing paid' for credits paid duly to date, 'critical/other existing credit' for delays or problematic existing credits, 'all paid' for all previous credits fully repaid, 'no credits/all paid' for no prior credits or all paid, and 'delayed previously' for past payment delays. (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the requested loan. The categories include: 'radio/tv' (for consumer electronics/appliances), 'furniture/equipment' (for home or business furnishings and tools), 'business' (for commercial or entrepreneurial ventures), and other specific classifications that indicate the loan's objective.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the financial scale of the transaction. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of savings information: '<100 DM', '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', and 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status, categorized by duration of employment in years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for this loan, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the relative burden of the repayment obligation on the borrower's available monthly funds after essential expenses. (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/widowed, female divorced/separated/married, or female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies whether there are any additional individuals or entities acting as co-applicants, guarantors, or debtors for the credit application. This indicates the level of shared responsibility or external financial backing for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address. A longer duration may indicate greater stability. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type and scale of the applicant's most valuable pledged asset or property (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans or credit arrangements with banks or stores (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their primary accommodation type (categorical: rent, own, for free).
- existing_credits: The total number of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) the applicant currently holds open at this same bank. This is a count of active liabilities and indicates the applicant's current level of credit engagement and potential debt burden with this institution. (numerical)
- job: Current employment classification, categorized by skill level and residency status (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, such as children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess potential risk factors related to employment stability and legal residency status (categorical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This feature is a derived numerical value calculated by dividing the total credit amount requested by the loan duration in months. It quantifies the monthly financial burden of the loan principal, serving as an indicator of repayment intensity and affordability. A lower ratio suggests a smaller, more spread-out obligation that may be easier to service, while a higher ratio indicates a concentrated, larger monthly principal commitment, which could signal higher repayment strain and associated credit risk. (numerical)
- employment_and_housing: A composite categorical feature derived from the cross of 'employment' duration and 'housing' status. It provides a joint view of a client's occupational stability and residential security, which are key indicators of overall financial reliability and risk. For instance, the combination "1<=X<4_own" suggests medium-term employment coupled with home ownership, potentially signaling lower default risk compared to a profile like "unemployed_rent," which indicates higher financial vulnerability. This synthesized view helps capture nuanced interactions that individual features might miss. (categorical)
- critical_credit_behavior: A numerical risk score derived from the original credit_history feature, where higher values are assigned to applicants with adverse credit behaviors (e.g., 'critical/other existing credit' or 'delayed previously'), and lower values to those with positive histories (e.g., 'existing paid' or 'no credits/all paid').

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in categorical ranges of Deutsche Mark (DM) balances or absence of an account. Categories include: 'no checking' (no account), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '200<=X' (substantial balance), and '<0' (negative/overdrawn balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- credit_history: Detailed record of the applicant's past behavior with credit and loans, including the timeliness of previous repayments and the presence of any critical or delinquent accounts (categorical)
- **purpose**: Purpose of the credit, indicating the intended use of the loaned funds (categorical). Categories include, but are not limited to, furniture/equipment, radio/television, used car, new car, business, education, repairs, domestic appliances, and retraining.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a key numerical indicator of the loan's size and financial exposure. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, <100 DM, 100 <= X < 500 DM, 500 <= X < 1000 DM, and >=1000 DM. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration in years, indicating the applicant's current job stability and continuity. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married or widowed, female divorced/separated/married, or female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of any additional parties who have co-signed or guaranteed the loan as debtors or guarantors (categorical: 'none', 'co applicant', or 'guarantor')
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical). A higher value may indicate greater stability.
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable property owned or pledged as collateral by the applicant, which serves as an indicator of their asset base and financial stability (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the applicant's existing installment plans with other banks or retail stores. This categorical feature reflects other ongoing debt commitments that could impact the applicant's ability to service the new loan. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific banking institution. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current active credit burden with the bank. (numerical)
- job: Occupation or employment type of the applicant, categorized by skill level and employment sector (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents or individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Status of having a registered telephone line in the applicant's name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess residency status and potential stability (categorical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This engineered feature is calculated by dividing the total requested credit amount by the loan duration in months. It quantifies the monthly financial burden of the loan principal, serving as an indicator of repayment intensity and concentration of risk. A lower ratio suggests a smaller, more spread-out obligation that may be easier to service, while a higher ratio indicates a larger, more concentrated debt burden per month, which could strain the borrower's cash flow and increase default risk. (numerical)
- employment_and_housing: This engineered categorical feature combines an applicant's current employment duration and their housing situation (e.g., rent, own, or free). It provides a composite view of financial stability and living cost commitments. For instance, a long-term employee who owns property may demonstrate greater economic resilience and lower risk, whereas a short-term renter might face higher financial volatility. This combination can reveal risk patterns not apparent when considering either feature in isolation, such as the specific challenges associated with short employment tenure combined with the recurring expense of renting. (categorical)
- critical_credit_behavior: A numerical risk score derived from encoding the original credit_history feature, where higher values indicate a history of adverse credit behaviors such as 'critical/other existing credit' or 'delayed previously'. This explicit ordinal encoding helps the model better distinguish applicants with risky credit backgrounds from those with neutral or positive credit histories like 'existing paid' or 'no credits/all paid'. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Possible values indicate no checking account ('no checking'), a negative balance ('<0'), a low positive balance ('0<=X<200'), or a substantial positive balance ('>=200'). (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the contractual period over which the loan is to be repaid (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'all paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'existing paid' (existing credits paid duly until now), 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayments), and 'critical/other existing credit' (critical account or other existing credit issues). (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical) — Specifies the intended use of the requested loan, with categories including 'car (new)', 'car (used)', 'furniture/equipment', 'radio/television', 'domestic appliances', 'repairs', 'education', 'vacation', 'retraining', 'business', and 'other'.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a key numerical indicator of the financial scale of the request. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and greater than or equal to 1000 DM. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment in years. The categories are: unemployed (<0 years), less than 1 year (<1), between 1 and 4 years (1<=X<4), between 4 and 7 years (4<=X<7), and 7 or more years (>=7). (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to the repayment of the current loan installment (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married or widowed, female divorced/separated/married, or female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of any additional co-applicants, guarantors, or debtors associated with the credit application. This feature assesses whether the applicant has third-party support for repayment, which can influence risk assessment. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable owned property, which serves as collateral or an indicator of financial stability. This includes real estate, building society savings agreements/life insurance, cars, or other tangible assets. (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in years, representing their current biological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans or payment agreements the applicant has with banks or retail stores (categorical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating their current living arrangement (e.g., rent, own, for free) (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same financial institution, including the one being applied for (numerical)
- job: Current employment type, categorized as unemployed/unskilled non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled employee/official, or highly qualified employee/self-employed/officer (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This feature serves as a proxy for stability and address verification. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable with two possible states: 'yes' or 'no'. This feature may be used to assess perceived employment stability or residency status, which can be a risk factor considered in the credit evaluation process. (categorical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This feature is a derived numerical value calculated by dividing the total requested credit amount by the loan duration in months. It represents the monthly financial burden or intensity of the credit request, serving as a measure of payment density. A lower ratio suggests smaller, more frequent payments relative to the loan term, potentially indicating a more manageable and less risky repayment schedule. Conversely, a higher ratio indicates larger monthly obligations relative to the term, which can strain a borrower's cash flow and signal higher default risk, making it a critical indicator of credit behavior and repayment capacity. (numerical)
- employment_and_housing: This engineered categorical feature merges the applicant's current employment duration category with their housing situation. It provides a composite view of stability and financial commitment, where patterns like long-term employment combined with home ownership may indicate lower risk, while short-term employment combined with renting or living rent-free may suggest higher financial vulnerability. The interaction helps capture nuanced risk profiles that individual features might miss. (categorical)
- critical_credit_behavior: A numerical risk score derived from the original credit_history feature, where higher values indicate more adverse credit behaviors (e.g., 'critical/other existing credit' or 'delayed previously') and lower values indicate positive histories (e.g., 'existing paid' or 'no credits/all paid'). This encoding explicitly prioritizes risk differentiation by mapping historical behavior to an ordinal scale, helping the model isolate applicants with demonstrated repayment problems. (numerical)

- employment_and_housing: This feature is a composite of two key financial indicators: the applicant's employment duration (in years) and their current housing arrangement. It provides a more nuanced view of stability than either factor alone, as long-term employment combined with home ownership typically indicates lower risk, while short-term employment combined with unstable or dependent housing (e.g., 'for free') suggests higher financial vulnerability. The specific categories, such as '>=7_own' or '1<=X<4_rent', directly encode these joint risk profiles for credit assessment. (categorical)
- job: The applicant's current occupational category, which includes classifications such as high-qualified/self-employed/management, skilled employee/official, unskilled resident, and unemployed/low-skilled non-resident (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This includes co-applicants or individuals who have pledged collateral or guarantee for the loan. (categorical)
- credit_behavior_stability: This feature is a composite categorical variable that encodes an applicant's historical credit behavior alongside their current employment duration and housing situation. It captures the interaction between past credit risk (e.g., critical, good, or existing paid) and present socio-economic stability (e.g., employed for >=7 years and owning a home, or renting with shorter employment). Applicants with a history of critical credit behavior combined with unstable, short-term employment and rental housing are typically associated with the highest risk of default. Conversely, applicants with a history of good credit behavior who are in stable, long-term employment and own their home are generally considered lower risk. The feature synthesizes these dimensions into a single risk indicator. (categorical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This feature is a derived numerical value calculated by dividing the total credit amount requested by the loan duration in months. It represents the monthly financial burden or intensity of the loan request, serving as a measure of payment density. A lower ratio suggests smaller, more frequent payments relative to the principal, which may indicate a more manageable and less risky repayment schedule. Conversely, a higher ratio indicates larger monthly obligations relative to the loan term, which could signal a higher risk of payment default due to greater financial strain on the borrower. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as male single, female div/dep/mar, male mar/wid, or male div/sep (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the existence of other concurrent installment plans with other banks or stores. A plan signifies an ongoing credit agreement. (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:12:03,689 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. (numerical)
- checking_savings_cross: This feature is a composite variable that merges the applicant's checking account status and savings account status into a single categorical value. It provides a nuanced, cross-sectional view of immediate liquidity (from checking) and longer-term financial reserves (from savings). This combined perspective is critical for assessing overall financial stability and risk; for instance, an applicant with a negative checking balance and minimal savings presents a significantly higher liquidity risk compared to an applicant with healthy balances in both accounts. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the agreed loan repayment period (numerical)
- credit_behavior_stability: This feature is a composite categorical variable that merges an encoded credit history rating (typically ranging from 0 for no credits to 4 for critical/delayed payments) with a combined employment duration and housing situation. It captures a multidimensional view of an applicant's reliability by integrating their past credit repayment behavior with their current employment stability (e.g., unemployed, employed for <1 year, 1–4 years, 4–7 years, or ≥7 years) and housing tenure (own, rent, or free). This combination helps identify applicants who may pose a higher default risk due to both a poor credit history and unstable living or employment circumstances, as well as those who present lower risk through consistent repayment and stable employment while owning or long-term renting their home. (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit, categorizing the intended use of the requested loan funds (categorical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, categorized as 'none' (no other plans), 'bank' (plans with a bank), or 'stores' (plans with stores) (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical: 'none', 'co applicant', 'guarantor')
- intensity_stability_ratio: This numerical feature is calculated by dividing the credit amount to duration ratio (the average monthly credit burden) by the applicant's residence_since (the number of years living at the current address). It quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the requested debt obligation and the applicant's residential stability. A lower value suggests that an applicant is taking on a relatively modest monthly debt burden while demonstrating long-term residential stability, which is typically associated with lower financial risk. Conversely, a higher ratio may indicate a heavy debt load relative to residential tenure, potentially signaling higher risk. (numerical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This feature is calculated by dividing the total credit amount by the loan duration in months. It represents the monthly financial burden or intensity of the credit request. A lower ratio suggests a smaller, more spread-out loan, which may be easier to repay and indicate lower risk. A higher ratio indicates a larger, more concentrated financial obligation per month, which could strain the borrower's cash flow and signal higher default risk. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type and scale of the applicant's existing assets or collateral, categorized as 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car or other', or 'no known property' (categorical)
- job_credit_behavior_cross: This feature is a composite categorical variable formed by combining the applicant's occupational category with their credit behavior stability rating. It captures the interaction between employment type (e.g., skilled, unskilled resident, management) and the historical stability of the applicant's credit behavior (e.g., duration at current job combined with housing status). This cross provides a more nuanced risk profile, as a stable credit history may be weighted differently depending on the applicant's job security and income potential. For instance, a skilled professional with long-term, stable credit behavior typically represents a lower risk than an unemployed applicant with a short or unstable credit history. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and greater than or equal to 1000 DM. (categorical)
- employment_and_housing: This engineered categorical feature is a cross of 'employment' duration and 'housing' status, designed to capture synergistic effects on perceived financial stability and risk. It encodes patterns such as longer employment tenure combined with home ownership (indicating lower risk) versus shorter employment with renting or free housing (which may suggest higher risk or transience). The specific categories represent combined states, allowing the model to evaluate the joint influence of employment history and living situation on creditworthiness more effectively than considering each feature in isolation. (categorical)
- job: Occupation of the applicant, categorized as unskilled, skilled, or highly skilled (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- housing: Current housing status of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or have other living arrangements (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:13:27,024 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount: Credit amount in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- checking_savings_cross: This feature is a composite of the applicant's checking account status and their savings account status, creating a joint categorical variable that captures the interaction between immediate transactional liquidity and longer-term financial reserves. It provides a more nuanced assessment of financial stability than either feature alone, as it identifies risk patterns such as a negative checking balance combined with minimal savings, versus a stable checking range paired with substantial savings. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- credit_behavior_stability: This feature is a composite categorical variable formed by combining the applicant's encoded historical credit behavior (e.g., critical, good, very good) with their current employment and housing stability status (e.g., unemployed/for free, 1<=X<4/own, >=7/for free). It captures the interaction between past financial responsibility and present socioeconomic stability. Applicants with critical credit histories coupled with unstable employment or housing (e.g., unemployed and living for free) are considered high-risk, while those with favorable credit behavior and stable, long-term employment and housing arrangements are typically lower-risk. The combined view provides a more holistic assessment of default risk than either factor alone. (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)  
- desc: The intended use for the requested loan, categorized into specific domains such as a new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, vacation, retraining, business, or other.
- other_payment_plans: Status of other existing installment plans with banks or stores, indicating concurrent financial commitments (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their name. This is a categorical feature with possible values: 'yes' (has a telephone), 'none' (does not have a telephone). (categorical)
- other_parties: Other debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application, indicating whether a co-applicant or guarantor is involved (categorical)
- intensity_stability_ratio: This feature is calculated by dividing the credit amount to duration ratio (the average monthly credit burden) by the number of years the applicant has resided at their current address. It quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the requested debt obligation and the applicant's residential stability. A lower value suggests the applicant is taking on a manageable level of debt relative to their demonstrated residential longevity, which may indicate financial prudence and lower risk. Conversely, a higher ratio could signal a heavy debt burden relative to a short or unstable residential history, potentially pointing to higher risk. (numerical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This feature is a derived numerical metric calculated by dividing the total requested credit amount by the loan's duration in months. It quantifies the monthly financial burden or intensity of the loan request. A lower ratio suggests a smaller monthly obligation relative to the loan term, which may indicate a more manageable and less risky repayment plan. Conversely, a higher ratio indicates a larger monthly burden, which could strain the borrower's finances and signal higher repayment risk, especially if their income is unstable. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's existing property or assets, used as collateral or an indicator of financial stability. Categories include 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property'. (categorical)
- job_credit_behavior_cross: This feature is a composite categorical variable formed by concatenating the applicant's occupational category with their credit behavior stability rating. It captures the interaction between employment profile (e.g., high-qualified/self-employed/management, skilled employee, unskilled resident, unemployed) and historical credit reliability (e.g., no credits/all paid, existing credits paid duly, delayed payments, critical account). This combination provides a more nuanced risk indicator, as a stable employment type paired with a positive credit history suggests higher repayment capacity, whereas a risky employment status combined with a poor credit record signals a substantially elevated default risk. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions: '<100 DM', '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment_and_housing: This feature is a composite categorical variable created by crossing an individual's employment duration category with their current housing situation. It provides a more nuanced view of financial and residential stability than either feature alone. For instance, a person with long-term employment (e.g., '>=7' years) who also owns their home represents a profile of high stability and lower perceived risk. Conversely, someone who is unemployed but lives in free housing presents a different risk profile. The combination helps assess the consistency and security of an applicant's living situation in the context of their job tenure, which is a strong indicator of overall ability to manage and repay long-term credit. (categorical)
- job: Job (categorical) - The applicant's current occupational category, which is a key indicator of income stability and creditworthiness. Categories include: unskilled resident, unskilled non-resident, skilled employee, and high-qualified/self-employed/management.
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating their current living arrangement and whether they rent, own, or live in accommodation provided for free (categorical)
- employment_purpose_cross: This feature is a composite categorical variable that combines the applicant's employment stability and housing situation with the stated purpose of the requested credit. It captures interaction effects between the loan's intended use and the borrower's foundational financial and residential stability. For instance, an application for a business investment by an applicant with long-term employment and home ownership may indicate a different risk profile compared to an application for luxury goods by an unemployed applicant living rent-free. This cross helps assess whether the purpose aligns with or contradicts the applicant's economic standing, providing nuanced insight into repayment capacity and intent. (categorical)
- telephone_property_stability: This feature is a composite categorical variable formed by crossing the applicant's telephone line status with their declared property magnitude. It captures the interaction between communication accessibility (a proxy for stability and reachability) and tangible asset ownership. The combination may indicate an applicant's level of personal organization, financial infrastructure, and overall socioeconomic stability. For instance, having a telephone and owning substantial property could suggest stronger roots and reliability, while the absence of both might indicate higher financial precariousness. The feature aims to reveal nuanced risk patterns that the individual components alone might not expose. (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:14:52,560 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, expressed in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This is a fundamental numerical feature indicating the scale of the financial request. (numerical)
- checking_savings_cross: This feature is a composite categorical variable created by combining the applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It provides a detailed, cross-sectional view of both immediate liquidity (from the checking account) and longer-term financial reserves (from savings). This combination is critical for assessing overall financial stability and risk; for example, an applicant with "no checking" and "<100" in savings presents a very different risk profile than one with "0<=X<200" in checking and ">=1000" in savings. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from the time of disbursement until the final payment is due (numerical)
- credit_behavior_stability: This feature is a composite categorical variable formed by concatenating the encoded credit history (credit_behavior) with the combined employment and housing stability category. It simultaneously captures an applicant's past repayment behavior (e.g., existing credits paid back duly, critical account) and their current socio-economic stability, as indicated by employment duration and housing arrangement (e.g., own, rent, for free). This combination provides a more holistic risk indicator, as applicants with poor credit histories coupled with unstable or short-term employment and non-owned housing typically represent the highest risk, whereas those with good credit histories and long-term, stable employment in owned housing are generally lower risk. (categorical)
- **purpose**: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized by the type of goods or services to be financed (categorical).
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the existence of other concurrent installment plans with either banks or retail stores. A value of 'none' signifies no other active installment debt, while 'bank' or 'stores' denotes an existing plan with those respective institutions. This feature helps assess the applicant's current debt burden and payment obligations. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- other_parties: Other debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application, indicating whether there is a co-applicant, guarantor, or another party with liability for the loan. (categorical)
- intensity_stability_ratio: This numerical feature is calculated by dividing the credit amount to duration ratio (the average monthly credit burden) by the applicant's residence_since (the number of years living at the current address). It quantifies the tension between the intensity of a new debt obligation and the applicant's demonstrated residential stability. A lower value suggests the applicant is taking on a relatively modest monthly burden while maintaining long-term housing stability, which is typically associated with lower risk. Conversely, a higher ratio indicates a heavy monthly debt load relative to a short tenure at the current residence, potentially signaling financial overextension or instability. (numerical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This feature is a derived numerical value calculated by dividing the total requested credit amount by the loan's duration in months. It represents the monthly financial burden or intensity of the loan request, serving as a measure of payment density. A lower ratio suggests smaller, more spread-out payments, which may indicate a more manageable and less risky repayment plan. Conversely, a higher ratio indicates larger monthly obligations relative to the loan term, which could strain the borrower's cash flow and signal higher default risk. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type and scale of the applicant's existing assets or property, used as collateral for the credit (categorical)
- job_credit_behavior_cross: This feature is a composite categorical variable formed by crossing the applicant's occupational classification with their credit behavior stability rating. It simultaneously encodes the applicant's employment type (e.g., unskilled, skilled, management) and their historical credit reliability (e.g., critical, good, very good). This combination provides a more nuanced risk profile than either feature alone, as it identifies specific high-risk intersections (e.g., unskilled employment with critical credit history) and low-risk profiles (e.g., skilled employment with very good credit stability), which are strong indicators of repayment capacity and default probability. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions such as 'no known savings', '<100 DM', '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', and '>=1000 DM'. (categorical)
- employment_and_housing: This feature is a composite variable derived from the cross of 'employment' duration and 'housing' status. It provides a more granular view of an applicant's socio-economic stability by considering both job tenure and living arrangements. Longer employment typically indicates steady income, while home ownership (own) versus renting (rent) or living for free suggests different levels of financial commitment and asset base. The interaction can reveal nuanced risk profiles; for instance, long-term employment combined with home ownership may indicate strong stability, whereas short employment and renting could suggest higher financial vulnerability, even if individual features appear neutral. (categorical)
- job: Job category of the applicant, indicating their occupational skill level and residency status (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating their current living arrangement (categorical: rent, own, for free)
- employment_purpose_cross: This feature is a composite categorical variable that combines the applicant's employment stability duration, current housing status, and the stated purpose of the requested credit. It captures the interaction between the applicant's foundational financial stability (as indicated by job tenure and housing security) and the nature of the intended expenditure. This interaction is critical for risk assessment, as the risk level of a loan purpose is contextual. For instance, a 'new car' loan for an applicant with long-term stable employment and owned housing may represent a planned, manageable investment, whereas a 'vacation' loan for an applicant with very short employment tenure and rented housing could signal imprudent financial behavior or higher distress risk. (categorical)
- telephone_property_stability: This feature combines two distinct attributes: the applicant's access to a personal telephone line and the magnitude of their property assets. It captures the potential interaction between communication reliability and tangible asset ownership. The presence of a telephone may indicate stability and accessibility, while property ownership reflects financial substance. Their combination can signal a profile of organized personal management and established resources, which are often correlated with lower credit risk and more reliable repayment behavior. The categories represent all possible pairings of the original 'own_telephone' and 'property_magnitude' values. (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:16:16,783 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no checking account, a balance less than 0 DM (overdrawn), a balance between 0 and 200 DM, and a balance of 200 DM or more. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- checking_savings_cross: This feature is a composite variable created by crossing the applicant's checking account status with their savings account status. It provides a detailed, two-dimensional snapshot of immediate and reserve liquidity, capturing interactions such as a negative checking balance paired with moderate savings, which may indicate temporary cash flow issues despite some financial buffer. This combined view is more informative for risk assessment than either feature alone, as it reveals nuanced financial stability patterns, like whether an applicant maintains savings to offset a low or overdrawn checking account. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from origination to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_behavior_stability: This feature is a composite categorical variable that merges encoded historical credit behavior (e.g., critical, good, very good) with current employment and housing stability (e.g., employment duration ranges combined with housing status: own, rent, or free). It captures the interaction between an applicant's past credit management and their present socioeconomic stability. Applicants with critical credit histories coupled with short employment tenure and rented housing are typically higher risk, while those with favorable credit behavior, longer employment, and home ownership generally indicate lower risk. The combined representation helps assess overall reliability more holistically than either factor alone. (categorical)
- **name: purpose**  
  **desc:** This feature indicates the stated purpose for which the credit loan is being requested. It is a categorical variable that reflects the primary intended use of the borrowed funds, such as financing a vehicle, household goods, education, or other specific needs.  
  **type:** categorical
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's existing installment plans with other banks or retail stores (categorical)
- own_telephone: Availability of a telephone in the applicant's name (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit. (categorical)
- intensity_stability_ratio: This feature is calculated by dividing the credit amount to duration ratio by the applicant's residence_since (years at current residence). It evaluates the balance between the intensity of a credit request (annualized debt burden) and the applicant's residential stability. A lower value suggests a manageable debt commitment relative to a long, stable housing history, which is often associated with lower risk. Conversely, a higher ratio may indicate a heavy debt burden relative to a short tenure at the current residence, potentially signaling higher financial strain or instability. (numerical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This feature is a derived numerical value calculated by dividing the total credit amount by the loan duration in months. It represents the monthly financial burden or intensity of the credit request, serving as a measure of payment density. A lower ratio suggests smaller, more spread-out payments, which may indicate a more manageable and less risky loan structure. Conversely, a higher ratio indicates larger monthly obligations relative to the term, which could signal higher repayment pressure and greater associated risk for the lender. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type and relative value of the applicant's major assets or collateral, categorized as real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property (categorical)
- job_credit_behavior_cross: This feature is a composite categorical variable formed by concatenating the applicant's occupational category (job) with their credit behavior stability classification. It simultaneously encodes information about the borrower's employment profile (e.g., skilled, unskilled resident, management) and their historical credit reliability (e.g., stable, critical, highly qualified). This combination allows the model to assess risk based on the intersection of these two critical dimensions, where, for instance, a highly qualified job paired with a stable credit history indicates significantly lower risk, while an unskilled or unemployed status combined with a critical credit history suggests a substantially higher risk of default. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions such as '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment_and_housing: This feature is a composite of an applicant's employment duration and housing status. It provides a joint assessment of stability by considering both occupational tenure and residential arrangement. For instance, a long-term employee who owns property may indicate stronger financial grounding and lower risk, whereas a short-term renter might suggest higher transience and potential financial volatility. This cross-tabulation helps evaluate the applicant's overall capacity for sustained debt repayment. (categorical)
- job: Job (categorical) - The applicant's current occupational category and employment status, which may influence income stability and creditworthiness. Categories include unskilled resident, skilled, high qualif/self emp/mgmt, and others.
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- housing: Housing status of the applicant, indicating their current living arrangement (e.g., rent, own, or for free) (categorical)
- employment_purpose_cross: This engineered categorical feature is a cross of the applicant's employment duration, housing situation, and the stated purpose of the requested credit. It captures the nuanced interaction between an applicant's financial and residential stability and their intended use of funds, which is critical for risk assessment. For instance, a loan for business investment from an applicant with long-term employment and home ownership may indicate a different risk profile compared to a loan for a luxury item from an applicant with short employment tenure who is renting. The feature helps identify risk patterns that single features might miss, such as whether stable applicants are seeking credit for appreciating assets or necessities versus unstable applicants seeking credit for discretionary spending. (categorical)
- telephone_property_stability: This categorical feature is a composite variable that cross-references the applicant's access to a personal telephone line with the magnitude of their declared property assets. It suggests a potential relationship between communication infrastructure stability and tangible asset ownership. The presence of a telephone, particularly when combined with substantial property (e.g., real estate or life insurance), may indicate a higher degree of personal organization, financial stability, and commitment to established services—factors often associated with reliable financial behavior. Conversely, combinations like 'none_no known property' could imply a lack of both communication channels and material collateral, potentially signaling higher risk. The feature aims to capture nuanced profiles where asset ownership and connectivity interact to influence creditworthiness. (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset (numerical)
- checking_savings_cross: This feature is a combined categorical variable created by intersecting the applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It provides a detailed, two-dimensional view of immediate and reserve liquidity. For example, a status like "0<=X<200_100<=X<500" indicates moderate funds in checking alongside modest savings, suggesting basic financial stability. In contrast, a status like "<0_no known savings" signals both a deficit in the transactional account and an absence of reserves, representing a higher liquidity risk. This cross-tabulation offers more nuanced insight into financial health than either feature alone. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from the start date to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_behavior_stability: This feature is a composite categorical variable formed by concatenating three elements: an encoded credit behavior rating (from 0 to 4, where lower values may indicate higher risk), the duration of current employment (in years, binned into categories like '1<=X<4'), and the applicant's current housing situation (e.g., 'rent', 'own', or 'for free'). It simultaneously captures historical credit repayment behavior, job stability, and residential security, providing a multidimensional view of an applicant's financial reliability. Patterns such as a low credit rating combined with short employment tenure and renting may signal high default risk, whereas a good credit rating with long-term employment and home ownership typically indicates lower risk. (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- desc: The specific intended use for the requested loan, such as financing a vehicle, household goods, or business needs. This is a categorical feature that indicates the primary goal of the credit, which is a key factor in assessing risk and loan suitability.
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans with other banks or stores, which may indicate existing debt obligations and financial commitments (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their name. This is a categorical feature with possible values of 'yes' (has a telephone), 'no' (does not have one), or 'none' (no telephone line exists). (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit (categorical)
- intensity_stability_ratio: This feature is calculated by dividing the credit amount to duration ratio by the applicant's residence_since (number of years at current residence). It evaluates the interplay between the intensity of a credit request (debt burden per month of the loan) and the applicant's residential stability. A lower value suggests a more manageable debt load relative to a long, stable residence history, which is often associated with lower risk. Conversely, a higher ratio may indicate a heavy debt burden coupled with shorter residential tenure, potentially signaling higher financial risk. (numerical)
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: This feature is calculated by dividing the total requested credit amount by the loan duration in months. It represents the monthly financial burden or intensity of the loan request, serving as a measure of payment density. A lower ratio suggests smaller, more frequent payments relative to the principal, which may indicate a more manageable and less risky repayment schedule. Conversely, a higher ratio indicates larger monthly obligations relative to the loan term, which could signal higher default risk due to greater financial pressure on the borrower. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset offered as collateral (categorical)
- job_credit_behavior_cross: This feature is a cross of the applicant's occupational category and their credit behavior stability, combining employment type with historical credit repayment patterns. It captures the interaction between income source reliability and credit history, which jointly influence risk. For example, a skilled worker with a stable, long-term credit history presents lower risk, while an unskilled resident with a short or unstable credit history may indicate higher default probability. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the total liquid savings and bond holdings, which indicates financial reserves and stability. (categorical)
- employment_and_housing: This engineered categorical feature merges the applicant's employment duration at their current job with their current housing arrangement. It is designed to capture nuanced financial stability and lifestyle commitments that individual features may not reveal. For instance, a long employment tenure combined with home ownership suggests high stability and lower risk, whereas a short employment period combined with renting may indicate higher transience and financial vulnerability. The interaction helps assess the applicant's overall capacity for sustained debt repayment within their living context. (categorical)
- job: The applicant's current occupational category, which influences credit risk assessment based on income stability and industry sector (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- housing: Indicates the applicant's current housing arrangement, which can include renting, owning property, living rent-free, or other occupancy statuses. This categorical feature reflects stability and financial commitment, potentially influencing credit risk assessment. (categorical)
- employment_purpose_cross: This engineered categorical feature captures the combined effect of an applicant's employment stability, housing situation, and the stated purpose of the requested credit. It assesses the alignment between the loan's intended use and the borrower's socioeconomic stability. For instance, a loan for business or home improvements from an applicant with long-term employment and home ownership may indicate lower risk, as the purpose could enhance their financial position. Conversely, financing luxury items or a new car by an applicant with short or unstable employment, even if they are a tenant or homeowner, may signal higher financial risk due to potential misalignment between commitment and stability. (categorical)
- telephone_property_stability: This feature is a categorical cross of two attributes: the applicant's telephone line status and the magnitude of their property/assets. It captures the combined effect of communication accessibility and tangible asset ownership, which together may indicate personal stability and organizational capacity. The presence of a telephone suggests reliable contact and potential social integration, while property ownership reflects financial commitment and collateral. Their interaction could reveal nuanced profiles, such as individuals with assets but no telephone (possibly prioritizing differently) or those with both, potentially signaling stronger socioeconomic footing and lower default risk. (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:17:43,552 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the model's performance for predicting credit approval, I will propose three feature engineering steps using the available operators. These steps are designed to capture more intricate interactions and patterns in the data that may influence credit decisions.

1. \<checking_duration_combined\>\<cross\>\<checking_status\>\<duration\>\<This feature combines the checking account status with the duration of the credit. By capturing the interaction between immediate liquidity and the loan's time span, we can assess whether certain checking statuses combined with specific loan durations indicate increased or decreased risk.>
   
2. \<purpose_credit_behavior_combined\>\<cross\>\<purpose\>\<credit_behavior_stability\>\<By merging the purpose of the credit with the credit behavior stability, this feature examines how the intent for the credit interacts with past credit behavior. Applicants showing alignment between positive credit behavior and responsible loan purposes might be perceived as less risky, while those with negative behavior and risky purposes could indicate higher default risk.>

3. \<property_employment_combination\>\<cross\>\<property_magnitude\>\<employment_and_housing\>\<This feature combines the magnitude of the applicant's property with their employment and housing stability. This interaction captures the dual aspects of asset-backed stability and income/housing reliability, potentially providing insights into a borrower's ability to manage credit through asset and income stability.>

By devising these new features, we aim to extract deeper insights into applicant profiles that may not be immediately evident from individual features. This can help improve the model's capacity to discriminate between creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants.

A lower ratio may imply a more manageable loan request while a higher ratio could indicate a riskier loan.', 'employment_and_housing': 'By combining employment status with housing situation, this feature captures potential financial stability. For example, a person with stable employment and their own house may be seen as more creditworthy compared to someone with the same employment but renting.', 'credit_behavior_stability': 'This feature combines the encoded credit behavior with employment and housing stability, capturing both historical credit risk and current financial stability. Applicants with critical credit histories and unstable employment or housing may pose higher risk, while those with stable employment and favorable credit behavior may be less risky.', 'checking_savings_cross': 'This feature combines the checking account status with the savings status, providing a comprehensive view of short-term liquidity and long-term financial health. An applicant with a positive balance in both accounts is likely to be more financially stable than someone with a negative checking balance and no savings.', 'job_credit_behavior_cross': "This feature merges the applicant's job category with their credit behavior stability, capturing both the employment type and historical credit behavior. High-qualified applicants with stable credit behavior are likely to be more reliable borrowers than unemployed or unskilled applicants with critical credit histories.", 'intensity_stability_ratio': 'By dividing the credit amount to duration ratio by the number of years at the current residence, this feature assesses the relationship between the applicant’s credit intensity and residential stability. A lower ratio indicates that an applicant takes on manageable debt while demonstrating long-term residence, which may imply stability and a lower risk.', 'employment_purpose_cross': "By combining employment stability and housing with the purpose of the credit, this feature reflects how the intended loan use interacts with the applicant's financial stability. For example, durable goods purchases by those with stable employment and housing might reflect less risk than luxuries by those with unstable conditions.", 'telephone_property_stability': 'This feature integrates the presence of a personal telephone line with property assets, suggesting a relationship between communication stability and asset ownership. Owning property, combined with communication infrastructure, might signal organized personal management, potentially reflecting better repayment behavior.', 'checking_duration_combined': "This feature combines the checking account status with the duration of the credit.
