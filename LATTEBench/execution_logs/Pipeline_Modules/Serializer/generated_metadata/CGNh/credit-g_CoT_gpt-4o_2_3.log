2025-12-18 10:49:43,621 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps to potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction_between_checking_account_status_and_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: Combining the checking account and savings status could capture financial stability and liquidity better than considering them separately. Cross feature interactions might reveal unique patterns affecting credit approval likelihood.

2. <employment_duration_encoded><label_encode><employment><Numerical_encoding_of_employment_duration>
   - Reasoning: Converting the employment duration into a numerical format can aid the model in understanding trends related to employment stability, which often correlates with the ability to repay credit.

3. <credit_to_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_loan_duration>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the credit amount per month of the loan duration helps in assessing how much financial burden the applicant is assuming per month. A high ratio might indicate a potential risk of credit default.

2025-12-18 10:51:07,426 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Logarithmic transformation of credit amount:
   - <log_credit_amount><log><credit_amount><Logarithmic_transform_of_credit_amount>
   - Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to the credit amount can help normalize the distribution of this feature, especially if it has a long-tailed distribution. This can reduce skewness and potentially improve prediction performance by stabilizing variance.

2. Cross-categorization of checking status and employment:
   - <check_employment_interaction><cross><checking_status><employment><Interaction_between_checking_account_and_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: This new feature captures the interaction between the applicant's bank account status and employment duration. It may reveal insights about financial behavior or stability that are not captured when these features are considered independently.

3. Age binned into categories:
   - <age_bin><bin><age><Categorical_binning_of_age_into_intervals>
   - Reasoning: Binning age into categories (e.g., young, middle-aged, senior) can capture non-linear relationships between age and creditworthiness. This can enhance the predictive power of models that work better with categorical data, and it may also reveal patterns or trends associated with different age groups.

2025-12-18 10:51:58,832 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations:

1. Creating an Interaction Feature between Installment Commitment and Duration

   - Reasoning: The combination of the installment commitment as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income and the duration of the credit can be crucial in understanding the financial burden and ability of the applicant to repay over time. This interaction can help capture the overall financial load of the loan relative to its duration, thereby providing a deeper insight into creditworthiness.

   
   <installment_duration_interaction><cross><installment_commitment><duration><Interaction_between_installment_commitment_and_duration>
   

2. Logarithmic Transformation of Residence Since

   - Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence can help in normalizing the distribution if this feature is skewed. The tenure at the current residence may indicate stability and thus is potentially informative for predicting creditworthiness.

   
   <log_residence_since><log><residence_since><Logarithmic_transform_of_years_at_current_residence>
   

3. Encoding Credit History

   - Reasoning: Encoding credit history into numerical values may improve model interpretability and predictive power by converting categorical credit patterns into a numerical format, which models can leverage effectively in training.

2025-12-18 10:54:15,829 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps to generate new features that can potentially improve the performance of the downstream model in predicting credit approval:

1. Feature: Cosine transformation of the natural logarithm of credit amount.
   - Reasoning: Applying trigonometric transformations such as cosine to logarithmic values can capture cyclical patterns and less obvious relationships in the data. This transformation might uncover hidden periodicity related to the loan amounts.
   - Output:  
    
   <cosine_log_credit_amount><cosine><log_credit_amount><Cosine_transformation_of_logarithmic_credit_amount>
   

2. Feature: Interaction between savings status and installment commitment.
   - Reasoning: The relationship between savings status and installment commitment might provide insight into the applicant's ability to manage debt given their savings. Categorizing this interaction can capture unique combined financial conditions.
   - Output:
    
   <savings_installment_interaction><cross><savings_status><installment_commitment><Interaction_between_savings_status_and_installment_commitment>
   

3. Feature: Ratio of number of dependents to years at the current residence.
   - Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of the number of financial dependents to the number of years an applicant has been at their current residence can highlight stability versus financial burden, aiding in risk assessment.
   - Output:
    
   <dependents_residence_ratio><divide><num_dependents><residence_since><Ratio_of_dependents_to_years_at_current_residence>
   

These steps aim to derive features that capture complex relationships and interactions, providing more nuanced insights into creditworthiness.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the agreed loan repayment period (numerical)
- check_employment_interaction: Interaction feature combining the categories of checking account status and employment duration, represented as a concatenated categorical variable (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, indicating the balance level in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges: 'no checking account', '<0 DM' (negative balance), '0<=X<200 DM' (low positive balance), and '>=200 DM' (high positive balance). This feature is critical for assessing an applicant's liquidity and financial stability. (categorical)
- installment_duration_interaction: A categorical feature representing the combined effect of the loan's monthly installment commitment and its total duration. It is created by concatenating the `installment_commitment` value with the `duration` value, separated by an underscore (e.g., '2_21' indicates an installment commitment of 2 months and a loan duration of 21 months). This interaction term helps capture non-linear relationships and joint dependencies between repayment burden and loan term that may influence credit risk. (categorical)
- savings_installment_interaction: A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between a client's savings status and their number of existing installment commitments. It captures how the risk assessment of one's savings level is modified by their current debt obligations, with values like '100<=X<500_2' indicating a client with moderate savings (100 to 500 DM) and 2 existing installments. (categorical)
- **name**: purpose (categorical)
- **description**: The intended use for the requested loan, representing the applicant's primary objective. This feature categorizes the economic or personal goal of the credit, such as acquiring a vehicle, furnishing a home, or funding education. It is a critical determinant of risk assessment, as different purposes are associated with varying levels of financial commitment, collateral value, and historical repayment behavior.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a raw, unscaled numerical feature representing the principal loan amount before any interest or fees. (numerical)
- cosine_log_credit_amount: Cosine transformation applied to the natural logarithm of the original credit amount, which modulates the linearized value into a cyclical feature to potentially capture periodic or threshold-based patterns in risk (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the loan, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the relative burden of the repayment obligation on the borrower's available monthly funds. (numerical)
- num_dependents: The total count of individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance, such as children or other dependents (numerical integer)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, <100 DM, 100 ≤ X < 500 DM, 500 ≤ X < 1000 DM, and ≥1000 DM. This feature reflects the applicant's available liquid assets and financial stability. (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical representation of the applicant's past credit behavior, where a higher integer value generally indicates a more favorable credit history based on the original categorical assessment. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and existing obligations (categorical)
- dependents_residence_ratio: The ratio of the number of dependents to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as num_dependents divided by residence_since. This numerical feature may indicate financial pressure or stability, as a higher ratio suggests more dependents supported per year of residential stability. (numerical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. This feature reflects job stability, which is a key factor in credit risk assessment. (categorical)
- log_credit_amount: Natural_logarithm_of_the_credit_amount_aimed_at_normalizing_its_distribution_and_reducing_skew_for_improved_model_performance (numerical)
- log_residence_since: Logarithmic transformation of the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, applied to reduce skew and scale the feature for modeling (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds, categorized as 'none' (no other plans), 'stores' (plans with retail stores), or 'banks' (plans with banks or other financial institutions) (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence address (numerical). A lower value indicates higher residential mobility, while a higher value suggests greater stability.

2025-12-18 10:55:23,033 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <employment_checking_cross><cross><employment><checking_status><Interaction_between_employment_duration_and_checking_account_status>
   - Reasoning: Employment duration and checking account status are both crucial indicators of a borrower's financial stability. By creating an interaction term that captures the combined effect of these features, we may uncover non-linear relationships affecting credit approval decisions.

2. <credit_amount_to_dependents_ratio><divide><credit_amount><num_dependents><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_number_of_dependents>
   - Reasoning: This feature measures the financial burden of the credit amount per dependent, providing insight into financial strain or the applicant's ability to manage credit relative to dependents. It may help identify applicants who might struggle with repayments due to higher dependent burdens.

3. <purpose_encoded_cross><cross><purpose><checking_status><Interaction_between_encoded_loan_purpose_and_checking_account_status>
   - Reasoning: Loan purposes and checking account status are potentially influential in risk assessment. By combining them into an interaction term, we aim to capture any significant patterns that are influenced by the intended use of the credit and the applicant's liquidity status.

- **installment_duration_interaction**: A categorical feature representing the combined effect of the loan's monthly installment commitment and the total loan duration. It is created by concatenating the `installment_commitment` value (the number of existing installment commitments) with the `duration` value (the loan term in months), joined by an underscore. This interaction captures potential risk patterns where the number of concurrent installments and the loan's length jointly influence repayment behavior. (categorical)
- savings_installment_interaction: A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between a customer's savings account status and their current installment commitment. It captures the joint effect of these two financial stability indicators by concatenating the categorized savings_status (e.g., '<100', '100<=X<500', 'no known savings') with the installment_commitment value (e.g., '3', '4'), separated by an underscore. (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit, categorizing the intended use of the loan funds (e.g., new car, furniture/equipment, business, education, or domestic appliances) (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) (numerical)
- cosine_log_credit_amount: A numerical feature representing the cosine of the natural logarithm of the credit amount, which transforms the scaled logarithmic value to capture cyclical or periodic patterns that may exist within the credit range (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the loan, expressed as a fixed percentage of the borrower's disposable income (numerical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of known savings, which reflects financial stability and capacity for handling credit obligations. (categorical)

2025-12-18 10:56:26,792 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<savings_employment_cross><cross><savings_status><employment><Interaction_between_savings_status_and_employment_duration>

   Reasoning: This feature captures potential synergies between a person's savings account status and employment duration. An individual's savings provide stability, while job duration indicates reliability. Their intersection may offer insights into an applicant's overall financial stability and their likelihood of credit repayment.

2. \<credit_checking_cross><cross><credit_history><checking_status><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_checking_account_status>

   Reasoning: Checking account status and credit history are both key indicators of financial behavior. By cross-referencing these two features, we might extract deeper insights into the applicant's financial management habits, which could improve predictive accuracy of their credit risk.

3. \<purpose_dependents_cross><cross><purpose><num_dependents><Interaction_between_required_loan_purpose_and_number_of_dependents>

   Reasoning: The purpose of a loan and the number of dependents may jointly affect credit behavior. For example, taking a loan for educational purposes with multiple dependents may imply a different risk profile compared to a loan for electronics with few dependents. This feature can potentially capture variations in creditworthiness influenced by financial responsibilities related to dependents.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan repayment period (numerical)
- check_employment_interaction: A categorical interaction feature combining the checking account status and employment duration of the applicant. It is derived by concatenating the categories from the 'checking_status' and 'employment' features with an underscore, capturing potential non-linear relationships between an applicant's financial liquidity and job stability that may influence credit risk (categorical).
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. It indicates the balance level and can signify financial stability. Categories include: 'no checking' (no account), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '200<=X' (substantial balance), and '<0' (negative balance/overdraft). (categorical)
- installment_duration_interaction: A categorical feature representing the combined effect of the loan's monthly installment commitment and its total duration, created by concatenating the two values with an underscore (e.g., "3_9" indicates an installment commitment of 3 months and a loan duration of 9 months). This interaction captures the joint influence of repayment burden and loan term on credit risk. (categorical)
- savings_installment_interaction: A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between a customer's savings account status and their number of existing installment commitments. It captures the compounded risk profile from both liquidity (savings) and existing debt burden (installments), where each unique pairing of a savings_status category and an installment_commitment value forms a distinct interaction level. (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature indicates the intended use of the loan funds, with categories such as 'radio/tv', 'furniture/equipment', 'new car', and others, reflecting the applicant's primary financial objective for the credit.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested or granted, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- cosine_log_credit_amount: The cosine of the natural logarithm of the credit amount, a cyclical transformation that may help capture periodic or non-linear patterns in the relationship between the loan size and the target outcome (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the loan, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the relative burden of the repayment obligation on the borrower's available monthly funds (numerical).
- num_dependents: Count of individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance, such as children or other dependents (numerical integer)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions, such as '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'no known savings'. This feature reflects the applicant's available liquid assets and financial buffer. (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical representation of the applicant's past credit behavior, where 0 indicates all credits have been paid back duly, 1 indicates the applicant has critical or other existing credit, and 2 indicates the applicant has previously delayed payments (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- dependents_residence_ratio: The ratio of the number of dependents to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as num_dependents divided by residence_since. This feature represents the density of dependents relative to residential stability, where a higher value may indicate greater financial pressure per year of stability. (numerical)
- employment: Current length of employment in years, categorized into ranges: '<0' (unemployed), '0<=X<1' (less than one year), '1<=X<4' (one to under four years), '4<=X<7' (four to under seven years), and '>=7' (seven years or more). (categorical)
- log_credit_amount: The natural logarithm of the credit amount requested by the applicant, applied to reduce skew and normalize the distribution of the original monetary value (numerical)
- log_residence_since: The natural logarithm (base *e*) of the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, transformed to reduce skew and improve model stability (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence of concurrent installment plans with other institutions, specifically banks or retail stores. A "none" value denotes no other existing installment debt. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical: 'yes', 'no'). The feature 'none' is treated as a distinct category representing the absence of a listed telephone.
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, indicating stability (numerical)

2025-12-18 10:58:35,568 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Number of months over which the credit loan is scheduled to be repaid or the length of the loan agreement (numerical)
- check_employment_interaction: A categorical interaction feature combining the checking account status and employment duration. It is created by concatenating the raw string values of the original 'checking_status' and 'employment' features with an underscore, representing specific joint states of a client's liquidity and job stability. (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: 'no checking' for no account, '<0' for a negative balance, '0<=X<200' for a low positive balance, and '>=200' for a substantial balance. This is a critical indicator of financial liquidity and stability. (categorical)
- installment_duration_interaction: A categorical interaction feature combining the original 'installment_commitment' (number of existing installment commitments) and 'duration' (loan duration in months) into a single composite value, represented in the format "installment_commitment_duration" (e.g., "4_18"). (categorical)
- savings_installment_interaction: A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between a client's savings account status and their fixed monthly installment commitment for the loan. It captures how these two financial stability indicators jointly influence risk, with values like '<100_4' indicating low savings (<100 DM) paired with a high installment commitment (4). (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the loan funds, with categories including but not limited to business, repairs, radio/tv, and other personal or domestic expenses. It is a key determinant of risk, as different purposes are associated with varying likelihoods of repayment.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a continuous numerical feature representing the principal loan sum before interest. (numerical)
- cosine_log_credit_amount: The cosine of the natural logarithm of the credit amount, a cyclical transformation used to capture periodic patterns or smooth extreme non-linearities in the logged value (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The installment rate as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income, representing the monthly obligation for the requested loan. This numerical feature directly measures debt burden relative to income.
- num_dependents: Count of individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to support, typically including children or other dependents (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the approximate monetary level of savings, with classifications including: no known savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and 1000 DM or more. (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical representation mapping distinct categories of an applicant's past credit behavior to integer values, where each value corresponds to a specific qualitative assessment such as 'critical/other existing credit', 'delayed previously', 'existing paid', or other similar classifications (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and existing obligations (categorical: 'critical/other existing credit', 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', 'all paid', or 'no credits/all paid')
- dependents_residence_ratio: The proportion obtained by dividing the total number of dependents by the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, representing the density of dependents per year of stability. (numerical)
- employment: Current length of employment with the present employer, categorized into discrete time ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- log_credit_amount: Natural logarithm of the credit amount in Deutschmarks, transformed to reduce skew and improve model handling of high-value loans (numerical)
- log_residence_since: Natural logarithm of the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, transformed to reduce skew and improve model performance with continuous numerical data. (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence of other concurrent installment plans, typically with banks or retail stores, which may affect the applicant's existing debt burden and repayment capacity (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical: 'none' for no telephone, 'yes' for having a telephone)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical). A lower value indicates higher residential mobility, while a higher value suggests greater stability.

2025-12-18 10:58:39,803 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the operations provided:

1. Create an interaction feature between checking account status and credit history:

   <checking_credit_interaction><cross><checking_status><credit_history><Interaction_between_checking_account_status_and_credit_history>

   *Reasoning:* The interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their credit history could reveal the effect of financial liquidity on repayment behaviors. This could further capture intricate details about reliability and default risk.

2. Calculate the ratio of the credit amount to the number of months of the duration:

   <credit_to_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_loan_duration>

   *Reasoning:* This feature captures how the credit amount scales with respect to the loan duration. Higher values indicate a larger loan over a shorter duration, potentially increasing financial risk, while smaller values suggest smaller loans spread over a longer period.

3. Develop a composite feature representing the product of the number of dependents and installment commitment:

   <dependents_installment_product><multiply><num_dependents><installment_commitment><Product_of_number_of_dependents_and_installment_commitment>

   *Reasoning:* This feature reflects the compounded financial burden an applicant might face in supporting dependents while fulfilling loan commitments. Applicants with more dependents and higher installment rates could be at higher risk, providing more nuanced risk profiling.

2025-12-18 10:59:40,547 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- check_employment_interaction: A derived categorical feature representing the combined effect of an applicant's checking account status and their current employment status, used to capture potential interaction effects between these two financial stability indicators (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no checking' for no account, '<0' for a negative balance, '0<=X<200' for a low positive balance, and '>=200' for a substantial balance. (categorical)
- installment_duration_interaction: A categorical feature representing the combined effect of the loan's monthly installment commitment and its total duration, created by concatenating the `installment_commitment` value with the `duration` value using an underscore (e.g., '4_36' indicates an installment commitment of 4 months and a loan duration of 36 months). (categorical)
- savings_installment_interaction: A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between a client's savings account status and their fixed monthly installment commitment for the loan. It captures the relationship between available savings resources and the size of the recurring payment obligation. (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include, but are not limited to, new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, and other purposes. The purpose can indicate the risk profile and economic rationale behind the loan application.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a continuous numerical variable representing the principal loan sum before interest. (numerical)
- cosine_log_credit_amount: Cosine transformation applied to the natural logarithm of the credit amount, which introduces a periodic, non-linear feature to capture potential cyclical patterns or complex interactions in the scaled logarithmic data (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the loan, expressed as a fixed percentage of the borrower's disposable income (numerical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance, such as children or other dependents (numerical integer)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of known savings, which reflects financial stability and capacity for handling credit obligations. (categorical)
- credit_history_encoded: A numerical representation of the applicant's past credit behavior, where a higher integer value typically indicates a more favorable credit history, such as 'existing paid' or 'no credits/all paid', while lower values indicate higher risk categories like 'critical/other existing credit' (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and existing credit obligations, categorized to assess reliability (categorical)
- dependents_residence_ratio: The ratio of the number of dependents to the total number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as num_dependents divided by residence_since. This feature quantifies the density of financial dependents relative to residential stability. (numerical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years: '<0' indicates unemployed or less than zero years (e.g., new entrants), '1<=X<4' for 1 to under 4 years, '4<=X<7' for 4 to under 7 years, and '>=7' for 7 or more years. This categorical feature reflects employment stability, which is a key risk factor in credit assessment. (categorical)
- log_credit_amount: The natural logarithm of the original credit amount, applied to reduce skewness and scale the distribution for improved model performance (numerical)
- log_residence_since: Logarithmic transformation of the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, used to reduce skew and handle the non-linear relationship between tenure and credit risk (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant has with banks or stores, used to assess existing debt obligations and repayment burden (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name, which can serve as a proxy for stability and contactability (categorical: 'yes', 'none')
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical). A longer duration may indicate greater stability.
