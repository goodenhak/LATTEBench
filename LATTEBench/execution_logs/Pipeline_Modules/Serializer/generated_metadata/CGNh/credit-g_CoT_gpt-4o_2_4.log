You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'no credits/all paid', 'all paid', 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', and 'critical/other existing credit'. (categorical)
- **name**: purpose  
- **type**: categorical  
- **description**: This feature indicates the intended use of the loan or credit requested by the applicant. It is a categorical variable that classifies the primary objective of the credit, such as financing a vehicle, home appliances, education, business investment, or other personal needs. The specific purpose can influence risk assessment, as different loan types may have varying associated default rates based on economic factors and collateral value.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This numerical feature represents the principal loan amount before interest. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with the following possible levels: 'no known savings', 'less than 100 DM', '100 to less than 500 DM', '500 to less than 1000 DM', and '1000 DM or more'. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment with the current employer. Categories include unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count. This includes loans such as car loans, other bank loans, or similar regular payment obligations, but excludes the mortgage or rent for housing. It is a discrete numerical feature. (integer)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male married or widowed, female single, female married or widowed, or female divorced/separated (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical: e.g., 'none', 'guarantor', 'co-applicant').
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset offered as collateral, which influences credit risk assessment (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds with banks or stores, indicating existing debt obligations (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank. This is a numerical integer value representing the applicant's current active credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Current employment type, categorized by skill level and employment status (e.g., unskilled, skilled, highly qualified/self-employed/management) (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature with two possible states: 'yes' if the applicant is a foreign worker, or 'no' if the applicant is a domestic worker (categorical)
- avg_credit_duration_by_purpose: The average duration (in months) of all previous credits granted for the same purpose category as the current application, calculated from the historical data of the lending institution (numerical)
- age_category: Grouped_age_brackets_derived_from_numerical_age_via_binning_or_segmentation_to_capture_life_stage_risk_patterns (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:33:39,464 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 2032, 'completion_tokens': 222, 'total_tokens': 2254}
2025-12-18 11:33:39,464 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <installment_commitment_vs_existing_credits_ratio><ratio><installment_commitment><existing_credits><Ratio_of_installment_commitments_to_existing_credits>
   
   Reasoning: Calculate the ratio between the number of installment commitments and existing credits. This feature can provide insights into the applicant's credit utilization and burden, which is indicative of their risk profile.

2. <high_balance_checking_status><label_encode><checking_status><Binary_representation_of_high_checking_account_balance>
   
   Reasoning: Convert 'checking_status' to high balance binary labels ('>=200'). Applicants with high checking account balance are often considered less risky. This binary feature can capture that risk pattern effectively.

3. <purpose_by_max_credit_and_duration><groupbythenmax><purpose><credit_amount_duration_product><Maximum_credit_amount_duration_product_based_on_purpose>

   Reasoning: Create a feature by calculating the product of credit amount and duration to capture both the size and time-based risk and then find the maximum product value for each purpose. This can help understand the risk dynamics associated with specific purposes.

   Reasoning: This feature normalizes the ratio of credit amount to loan duration, which can help in understanding the relative size of the loan compared to its duration in a consistent manner across different scales.

2. \<age_duration_interaction\><cross><age_category><duration>\<Interaction_between_age_group_and_credit_duration\>  
   Reasoning: Creating an interaction between age groups and credit duration can reveal patterns specific to age groups and how they typically engage with loan durations, which might uncover insights related to credit risk.

3. \<employment_savings_interaction\><cross><employment><savings_status>\<Interaction_between_employment_level_and_savings_status\>  
   Reasoning: An interaction between employment level and savings status could provide insight into the financial stability and risk profile of applicants, as both factors contribute significantly to creditworthiness.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, denominated in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range or absence of an account: 'no checking' (no account), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '>=200' (high positive balance), or '<0' (negative balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the loan funds. Categories include, but are not limited to, new car, used car, radio/television, furniture/equipment, business, education, repairs, domestic appliances, and retraining.
- credit_amount_per_dependents: The total credit amount divided by the number of dependents, representing the average financial burden or credit allocation per dependent (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum for which the applicant is seeking financial approval. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and any outstanding credit issues (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or property offered by the applicant as collateral or security for the credit. This is a categorical feature with classes such as 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property'. (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)

- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same financial institution, encompassing all active accounts such as installment loans, revolving credit, and overdrafts. (numerical)
- installment_over_residence: The ratio of the borrower's total monthly installment commitments on existing loans to the number of years they have lived at their current residence. A higher value indicates a greater debt burden relative to residential stability. (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name. This is a categorical feature with possible values of 'yes' (has a telephone) or 'none' (no telephone registered).
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as 'male single', 'male married/divorced', 'female divorced/separated/married', and 'female single' (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, which includes children and other individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- avg_credit_duration_by_purpose: The average duration, in months, of all previous credits taken for the same purpose category as the current application, calculated from the applicant's credit history (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)

2025-12-18 11:40:27,801 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_history_vs_duration_interaction><cross><credit_history><duration><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_loan_duration>
   - Reasoning: By combining credit history with loan duration, we may capture patterns indicating the applicant's past credit behavior in relation to the length of loans they tend to receive. This interaction could reflect risk levels associated with different credit histories and durations.

2. <property_other_parties_interaction><cross><property_magnitude><other_parties><Interaction_between_property_magnitude_and_additional_parties>
   - Reasoning: The type of property offered as collateral and the presence of additional parties can influence credit decisions. By creating an interaction feature between these two elements, we might better understand the implications of collateral and shared financial responsibility on credit approval likelihood.

3. <employment_status_bin><bin><employment><Binned_employment_duration_categories>
   - Reasoning: Binning the employment status can simplify and group employment durations into broader categories. This can help in identifying significant patterns related to different employment stability levels, potentially improving model performance by reducing noise from detailed employment ranges.

2025-12-18 11:41:37,151 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features using feature engineering and focusing on improving the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_duration_vs_num_dependents_ratio><ratio><duration><num_dependents><Ratio_of_credit_duration_to_number_of_dependents>
   - Reasoning: By calculating the ratio between the credit duration and the number of dependents, we aim to assess financial stability relative to family obligations. A lower ratio might indicate that an applicant is seeking a short-term credit despite having multiple dependents, potentially suggesting financial strain.

2. <personal_status_property_interaction><cross><personal_status><property_magnitude><Interaction_between_personal_status_and_property_valued_as_collateral>
   - Reasoning: Crossing personal status with property magnitude can provide insights into how personal circumstances might influence the type of collateral offered. For instance, widowed individuals might have different property assets compared to single applicants, affecting the credit risk assessment.

3. <existing_credit_amount><exp><credit_amount><Exponential_scale_of_credit_amount>
   - Reasoning: Applying an exponential transformation to the credit amount can help capture nonlinear relationships between the size of the credit requested and its impact on the likelihood of credit approval. Large credit amounts might exponentially increase risk, and this transformation can highlight significant differences in credit size more effectively.
