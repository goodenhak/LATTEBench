2025-11-11 12:36:13,073 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps that might improve the downstream model's performance for credit risk prediction:

1. Age to Employment Contribution  
   - Feature Name:  <age_employment_contribution_ratio>  
   - Operator: ratio  
   - Feature1: age_duration_ratio  
   - Feature2: employment_duration_label_encoded  
   - Description: Combine the age to credit duration ratio with employment duration to assess how age is contributing relative to employment history, potentially highlighting stability and maturity in employment which may mitigate risk.

2. Purpose and Installment Impact  
   - Feature Name: <purpose_installment_cross>  
   - Operator: cross  
   - Feature1: credit_purpose_encode  
   - Feature2: installment_commitment  
   - Description: Cross the encoded credit purpose with installment commitment to understand how different purposes impact credit risk when considered with the percentage of income committed to installments.

3. Checking Status and Foreign Worker Interaction  
   - Feature Name: <checking_foreign_worker_interaction>  
   - Operator: cross  
   - Feature1: checking_status_encoded  
   - Feature2: foreign_worker_credit_purpose_enc  
   - Description: Create an interaction feature between checking status and foreign worker status with encoded purpose to understand the combined effect of these factors on credit risk, especially focusing on how being a foreign worker with different checking account statuses affects the decision. 

These engineered features can provide more nuanced insights into the relationships between individuals' financial behaviors and their credit risk, potentially leading to improved prediction accuracy in the model.

   *Reasoning: Normalizing employment duration can help balance the effects of the original feature's range. This can improve model stability by reducing the influence of magnitude and allowing for a clearer comparison with other features.*

2. \<age_duration_engagement\>\<multiply\>\<age_duration_ratio\>\<residence_since\>\<Engagement_factor_by_multiplying_age_duration_ratio_and_residence_since\>
   *Reasoning: This feature reflects both the proportion of age relative to credit duration and the stability indicated by residence duration. This combination can provide insights into an individual's risk level due to both temporal and behavioral stability.*

3. \<checking_status_employment_encoded\>\<cross\>\<checking_status_encoded\>\<employment_duration_label_encoded\>\<Combined_encoding_for_checking_status_and_employment\>

   Reasoning: By taking the absolute frequency of the interaction between employment and checking status, it allows us to quantify the combined effect of these two features on credit risk. Useful in highlighting combinations that appear riskier than others.
