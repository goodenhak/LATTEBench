   - Reasoning: Binning the ages into categories based on quartiles (e.g., young, middle-aged, senior) could capture non-linear relationships between age and credit approval likelihood that are not immediately apparent in the raw numerical format.

2. \<credit_per_income_ratio\><divide>\<credit_amount\>\<installment_commitment\>\<ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment>
   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio of the credit amount to the installment commitment could help capture financial strain. A higher ratio might suggest a higher financial burden relative to income, which could negatively impact credit decisions.

3. \<savings_employment_encoded\><label_encode>\<savings_employment_interaction\>\<numerical_representation_of_savings_and_employment_combination>
   - Reasoning: Label encoding the interaction between savings status and employment to convert it into a numerical format makes it more usable for the downstream task, enhancing the decision model's understanding of the combined effect of savings and employment on credit approval.

   - Reasoning: Using logarithmic transformation on credit amounts can help in reducing skewness if the distribution of credit amounts is not normally distributed, leading to potentially more stable models.

2. <age_bin><bin><age><categorize_age_into_bins_to_capture_age_related_patterns_in_credit_decisions>
   - Reasoning: Binning age into categories can help capture nonlinear relationships between age and credit outcomes, especially if certain age groups are associated with different credit risk profiles.

3. <employment_duration_ratio><ratio><employment><duration><relative_duration_of_employment_to_credit_duration_as_a_mark_of_stability_and_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the ratio between employment duration and credit duration might provide insights into the borrower's stability and ability to repay, which can be a crucial variable in predicting credit decisions.

2025-11-11 12:28:58,678 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 2402, 'completion_tokens': 247, 'total_tokens': 2649}

   Reasoning: Creating a new feature that combines credit amount and installment commitment helps gauge the total financial obligation a person is undertaking. A higher total obligation might indicate higher risk, affecting credit decisions.

2. \<credit_history_employment_cross\><cross>\<credit_history\>\<employment\><interaction_between_credit_history_and_employment_to_capture_risk_patterns>

   Reasoning: Combining credit history and employment status helps identify deeper patterns that could influence credit approval. For instance, critical credit history with unstable employment could be a strong indicator of risk.

3. \<savings_to_loan_ratio\><divide>\<savings_employment_encoded\>\<credit_amount\><ratio_of_savings_employment_to_loan_to_assess_financial_stability>

   Reasoning: Evaluating the ratio of savings and employment (from the encoded interaction) relative to the credit amount can highlight the financial stability of an applicant. A higher ratio might indicate greater stability and a positive factor for credit approval.

2025-11-11 12:29:23,991 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_amount_by_income_ratio\><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment_to_understand_credit_affordability\>  
   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of credit amount to installment commitment will help gauge the applicant's financial burden in terms of credit repayments compared to their income commitment, providing insight into their financial stability.

2. \<employment_savings_combination_encoded\><label_encode><savings_employment_interaction>\<Encoded_representation_of_savings_and_employment_combination_to_facilitate_model_processing\>  
   Reasoning: Encoding the combination of savings status and employment can help the model better understand the nuanced relationship between these two factors, making it easier to identify patterns that could impact credit decisions.

3. \<property_housing_interaction\><cross><property_magnitude><housing>\<Interaction_between_property_and_housing_status_to_capture_assets_ownership_effect_on_credit_decision\>  
   Reasoning: Understanding the combined effect of property ownership and housing status provides deeper insight into the applicant's asset base, which can be an important factor in creditworthiness evaluation.
