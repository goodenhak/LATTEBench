2025-12-23 20:37:27,555 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the predictive capacity of the model, the following feature engineering steps are proposed:

1. <credit_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_monthly_installment_commitment>
   Reasoning: Creating a feature to directly compare credit amount against monthly installation commitment could reveal financial strain or prudence, impacting creditworthiness.

2. <employment_duration_encoded><label_encode><employment><Convert_employment_category_to_numerical_value_for_model>
   Reasoning: Converting the employment status to a numerical label can allow the model to better understand and quantify the employment duration impact on credit approval likelihood.

3. <history_property_crossed><cross><credit_history><property_magnitude><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_property_ownership_status>
   Reasoning: Combining credit history with property ownership can reveal complex patterns concerning past credit behavior and asset possession, potentially useful for predicting credit approval outcomes.

These engineered features can provide deeper insight into the applicant’s financial behaviors and stability, thus potentially improving the model's predictive accuracy regarding credit approval decisions.

   Reasoning: The combination of 'checking_status' and 'savings_status' will provide insights into the overall financial health and liquidity of the applicant. Cross-referencing these can help reveal patterns or risks not evident when considering them separately.

2. \<log_transformed_credit_amount\>\<log\>\<credit_amount\>\<logarithmic_transformation_of_credit_amount_to_reduce_skewness\>

   Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to 'credit_amount' can reduce skewness and help stabilize variance, enhancing the performance of models sensitive to these issues, such as linear regression or models incorporating distance metrics.

3. \<credit_history_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<credit_history\>\<encoded_credit_history_to_convert_categorical_to_numerical_for_modelling\>

   Reasoning: Converting 'credit_history' from categorical to numerical form using label encoding can allow models that require numerical input or benefit from additional numerical features to better integrate and utilize this information.

   - Reasoning: A higher credit amount relative to residency duration might indicate instability or a riskier credit profile. Dividing by residence years provides insight into how much credit amount is justified by the individual's residency, adding context to a person's financial stability and commitment to their area.

2. \<property_and_savings_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<property_and_savings_combined\>\<Encoded_version_of_property_and_savings_combination_for_numerical_analysis\>  
   - Reasoning: Converting the combination of property and savings into a numerical value can allow the model to handle the interaction term better and potentially discover non-linear relationships between property, savings, and the target variable.

3. \<risk_factor\>\<multiply\>\<credit_to_income_ratio\>\<employment_label\>\<Interaction_between_credit_affordability_and_employment_stability_as_risk_factor\>  
   - Reasoning: Employment stability is a key factor in assessing credit risk. By multiplying the credit-to-income ratio with employment label, we create a feature that captures both the financial burden of credit and the security of income, thus highlighting the risk associated with lending to an individual.

1. \<age_credit_burden_ratio\>\<divide\>\<age_duration_interaction\>\<credit_per_month\>\<age-related_burden_of_credit_payments\>: This feature calculates the age-related burden on credit payments indicating how long it would take for an individual at a specific age to pay off their credit relative to their age and credit duration. It might help identify younger or older applicants with potentially riskier profiles or more stable repayment behaviors.

2. \<employment_property_savings\>\<cross\>\<employment_label\>\<property_and_savings_combined\>\<interaction_of_employment_stability_and_property_savings\>: This feature creates interaction between employment stability and property savings status.

2. \<normalized_age\><minmax\><age\><Normalized_age_scaled_between_0_and_1\>  
   *Reasoning:* Normalizing the age allows other models to consider age along with other features that might be normalized or on a different scale. It helps in reducing the impact of extreme age values.

   *Reasoning*: This feature will indicate how much the credit amount is relative to their monthly installment commitments, providing additional information about the borrower's ability to handle credit payments.

2. \<checking_property_crosstype\><cross\><checking_status\><property_magnitude\><Cross_interaction_between_checking_account_status_and_property_magnitude_to_capture_joint_effects>

   *Reasoning*: By combining the checking account status and property magnitude, we can get insights into the joint financial status of an applicant, which might affect their creditworthiness.

3. \<employment_credit_history_interaction\><cross\><employment_label\><credit_history\><Interaction_between_employment_stability_and_credit_history_for_credit_risk_assessment>

   *Reasoning*: This interaction captures the relationship between employment stability and credit history, which is critical in assessing an applicant's credit risk. A stable job coupled with a strong credit history is a positive indicator of creditworthiness.

2025-12-23 20:38:14,180 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature generation:

1. \<age_credit_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<age\> \<credit_amount\> \<interaction_between_age_and_credit_amount_to_capture_impact_of_age_on_credit\>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the effect of age on the credit amount. It can help identify patterns where age might impact the borrowing capacity or behavior.

2. \<normalized_credit_instalment_ratio\> \<zscore\> \<credit_instalment_ratio\> \<standardized_credit_to_installment_affordability_ratio_to_detect_outliers_and_normalize_data\>
   - Reasoning: By standardizing the credit_to_installment affordability ratio, we can effectively handle outliers, which may improve the robustness of the downstream predictive model.

3. \<savings_job_combination\> \<cross\> \<savings_status\> \<job\> \<interaction_between_savings_account_and_job_type_to_uncover_occupational_and_financial_behavior_patterns\>
