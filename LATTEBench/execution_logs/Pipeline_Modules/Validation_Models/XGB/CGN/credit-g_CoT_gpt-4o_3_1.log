   - This feature represents the average monthly credit amount. It helps to normalize the credit amount by the length of the credit term, making the model better understand whether a larger credit amount is justified over a longer duration.

2. \<employment_savings_cross\><cross>\<employment\>\<savings_status\><interaction_between_employment_and_savings_status>
   - This feature captures the interaction between the applicant's employment history and their savings status. The combination of stability in employment and the presence or absence of savings can be a significant factor in assessing credit risk.

3. \<age_zscore\><zscore>\<age\><standardized_age>
   - Standardizing the age feature helps in normalizing the data and reducing the effect of outlier ages when making predictions. This operation centers the age variable's mean and scales it, enhancing model convergence and performance.

2025-12-23 20:29:51,545 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<credit_per_residence_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<residence_since\>\<ratio_of_credit_amount_to_years_of_residence\>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the ratio of credit amount to the years of residence. It may provide insight into how stable an individual is in their current endeavor relative to the size of the credit they are handling.

2. \<employment_savings_label\>\<label_encode\>\<employment_savings_cross\>\<numerical_encoding_of_employment_and_savings_interaction\>
   - Reasoning: Converting the categorical interaction between employment and savings to a numerical format can often help the model to better interpret these interactions, potentially offering deeper insight into the applicant's financial behavior.

3. \<adjusted_credit_duration\>\<divide\>\<credit_duration_ratio\>\<duration\>\<normalized_credit_duration_ratio_based_on_actual_duration\>
   - Reasoning: By normalizing the credit_duration_ratio with the actual duration of the credit, this feature may capture the applicant's relative credit burden more directly, offering the model a nuanced way to evaluate the feasibility of the credit being requested.

   Reasoning: Encoding the credit history as a numerical feature could better capture the ordinal relationship inherent in the categories, which might improve the model's ability to learn from the data.

2. \<employment_housing_cross\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<housing\>\<interaction_between_employment_status_and_housing\>

   Reasoning: Interacting employment status and housing type can capture nuanced patterns in the likelihood of credit approval based on one's employment and living situation. This could help the model pick up on trends about stability or levels of responsibility associated with different combinations.

3. \<credit_score_approx\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<credit_duration_ratio\>\<approximation_of_creditworthiness_as_ratio_of_amount_and_duration_ratio\>

   Reasoning: This feature attempts to create a rough credit score approximation by evaluating the credit amount against the credit duration ratio. This could provide a normalized view of risk, distinguishing between those seeking high credits for short durations and vice versa.

   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature is highly skewed, with a large range from 250 to 18424. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help reduce skewness and handle outliers, leading to improved model predictions.

2. \<age_bins\>\<bin\>\<age\>\<binned_age_for_categorized_age_groups>

   Reasoning: Grouping age into bins can help capture non-linear relationships between age and credit approval probability. Binning can also reduce model complexity and improve interpretability by categorizing individuals into meaningful age groups such as young, middle-aged, and senior.

3. \<credit_utilization_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<credit_duration_ratio\>\<ratio_of_credit_amount_to_credit_duration_ratio_to_captures_credit_utilization>

   Reasoning: Creating a new feature that represents the ratio of credit amount to the credit duration ratio can help capture information about how efficiently an applicant uses credit over time. This can be an important factor in determining creditworthiness.

2025-12-23 20:30:15,405 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<checking_employment_cross\><cross><checking_status><employment><interaction_between_checking_account_status_and_employment_status\>  
   - Reasoning: By crossing the checking account status with the employment status, we can capture information about financial stability, which can be relevant for assessing creditworthiness.

2. \<age_credit_amount_ratio\><divide><age><credit_amount><age_to_credit_amount_ratio\>  
   - Reasoning: By calculating the ratio of age to credit amount, we may capture how much credit someone takes relative to their age, potentially distinguishing older borrowers with smaller loans from younger borrowers with larger amounts, which might reflect varying risk levels.

3. \<credit_purpose_savings_cross\><cross><purpose><savings_status><interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_savings_status\>  
   - Reasoning: Crossing purpose and savings status could uncover patterns in how savings influence credit purposes, revealing risk differences (e.g., no savings for a new car purpose might hint at different risk than having savings in the same scenario).

   - Reasoning: By examining the interaction between checking and savings status, we can gain insight into a person's liquidity level and financial stability, which is crucial in determining creditworthiness.

2. \<credit_amount_per_dependents\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<num_dependents\>\<credit_amount_adjusted_for_dependents>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing credit amount by the number of dependents provides a per-capita credit amount, which can help assess financial burden relative to the household size.

3. <employment_duration_ratio><ratio><employment><duration><ratio_of_employment_duration_to_credit_duration_for_stability_assessment>

Reasoning:
1. *Age and Employment Interaction:* This feature captures potential interactions between an individual's age and their employment status, which may provide insights into their career stage and financial stability.
   
2. *Credit Amount and Purpose Combination:* By combining credit amount and purpose, we can potentially capture unique patterns or associations related to how and why credits are applied for, which can be used to enhance predictions of credit approval.

3. *Employment to Credit Duration Ratio:* This ratio can help assess the stability and reliability of an applicant, juxtaposing how long someone has been employed versus the duration of the credit. A higher ratio might suggest greater stability, adding an important dimension to the decision-making process.
