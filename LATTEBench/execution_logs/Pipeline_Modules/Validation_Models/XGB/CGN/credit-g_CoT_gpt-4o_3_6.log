   Reasoning: Calculating a ratio of credit amount to checking status encoded value could give an indication of credit burden relative to an income-like feature. Higher values may indicate greater risk of credit defaults.

2. \<age_bin\>\<bin\>\<age\>\<Binned_age_groups_to_categorize_customers_into_cohorts_based_on_age_demographics\>

   Reasoning: Binning the age feature can help in capturing non-linear relationships between age and the credit approval. Certain age segments may have different risk profiles (young or old consumers could behave differently regarding credit use).

3. \<employment_savings_interaction\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<savings_status\>\<Interaction_between_employment_duration_and_savings_status_to_capture_financial_stability\>

   Reasoning: The interaction between employment duration and savings status can identify customers who might have stable financial circumstances even if their saving is low, considering long employment tenure or vice versa. This feature may reveal underlying risk structure related to financial stability.

2025-12-23 20:39:49,482 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations:

1. \<checking_savings_cross\>\<cross\>\<checking_status\>\<savings_status\>\<Cross_product_of_checking_and_savings_status\>  
   Reasoning: By creating a cross-product of the checking and savings statuses, we can capture interactions between the two variables, which may reveal important insights into the financial stability of the applicant.

2. \<age_checking_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<age\>\<checking_status_encoded\>\<Ratio_of_age_to_checking_status_encoded\>  
   Reasoning: This feature represents the ratio of age to the checking status encoded value, potentially capturing the balance or pressure of financial responsibility at different ages in relation to their checking account status.

3. \<credit_per_residence\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<residence_since\>\<Credit_amount_divided_by_years_of_residence\>  
   Reasoning: This feature calculates how much credit the person received per year of residence. It may reveal correlations between long-term housing stability and credit amount, which could impact creditworthiness positively.

   Reasoning: Grouping ages into bins can help capture demographic patterns related to credit approval, which are not easily captured by the raw age values.

2. <credit_amount_to_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration_to_assess_creditworthiness_based_on_repayment_period>

   Reasoning: This feature evaluates the credit amount in relation to the duration of the credit. This helps in understanding whether a customer is applying for a large amount over a short period, which may indicate higher risk.

3. <credit_history_savings_status_cross><cross><credit_history><savings_status><Combine_credit_history_and_savings_status_to_create_a_rich_context_on_payment_history_and_liquidity>

   Reasoning: Combining credit history with savings status can capture more nuanced financial behaviors, potentially revealing deeper insights into a person's financial responsibility and liquidity, which could improve the prediction of creditworthiness.

2025-12-23 20:40:01,252 - INFO - LLM Output: Here's a structured approach to generating new features using the provided operators and explanations for each step:

1. \<credit_to_income_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<checking_status_encoded\>\<Creates a feature representing the ratio of credit_amount to the encoded checking status, indicative of financial leverage relative to checking status>
   - Reasoning: This feature can provide insights into an individual's credit health by indicating how much credit they are taking relative to their checking account status. It could be a strong predictor of whether a person should receive credit, particularly if it helps to normalize credit amount by a measure of existing income level.

2. \<normalized_age\>\<minmax\>\<age\>\<Normalizes the age feature between 0 and 1>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the age can help the model learn age-related patterns more effectively because it brings the scale within a range that's consistent with many machine learning algorithms' preferences, potentially improving convergence.

3. \<purpose_pincode\>\<label_encode\>\<purpose\>\<Converts the purpose of the credit into numerical form using label encoding>
   - Reasoning: Label encoding the 'purpose' feature allows for numerical computation and can help the model recognize patterns related to the purpose of credit, which might be significant in deciding credit approval based on historical defaults or successes for different purposes.

These new features could contribute to a richer feature set, improving the predictive performance of a model dealing with credit approval tasks.

3. \<employment_duration_score\>multiply\<employment\>\<duration\>Score_combining_employment_stability_with_duration_to_measure_credit_risk_based_on_employment_length

Explanation:
1. Credit Amount Duration Ratio: By creating a ratio of the credit amount to the duration, we can assess the credit burden over a specific time frame, which is useful for understanding the potential risk associated with the borrower's payment capability.

2. Credit Checking Interaction: The interaction between the credit amount and checking status encoded can provide insights into the borrower's financial status and influence on creditworthiness. A higher checking_status_encoded may indicate better financial health.

3. Employment Duration Score: Multiplying employment by the duration can give us an indication of how employment stability and the credit timeline might jointly affect risk. Longer employment periods combined with longer loan durations may indicate different risk profiles compared to shorter employment durations with similar loan spans.

1. \<credit_amount_per_month\><divide><credit_amount><duration><Credit amount normalized by loan duration to reflect monthly payment burden\>
   
   Reasoning: By dividing the credit amount by the loan duration, we obtain a monthly payment measure. This feature reflects the financial burden per month for the borrower, which is essential information for determining credit risk.

2. \<age_employment_ratio\><divide><age><employment><Ratio of age to years of employment indicating work experience relative to age\>
   
   Reasoning: This feature provides a measure of how much of a person's life has been spent in employment. A higher value could indicate more stable employment history relative to age, which might correlate with creditworthiness.

3. \<checking_savings_combined\><cross><checking_status_encoded><savings_status><Combined effect of checking account and savings account status\>
   
   Reasoning: The relationship between checking and savings account status can provide a more holistic view of the individual's liquid assets, potentially offering better insight into the individual's financial health and credit risk.
