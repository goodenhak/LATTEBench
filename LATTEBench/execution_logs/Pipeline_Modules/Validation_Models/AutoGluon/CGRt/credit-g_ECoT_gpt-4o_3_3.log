2025-08-31 23:24:01,334 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream task performance, I'll generate three new features by leveraging feature transformations that capture interactions, trends, or latent information which might not be present explicitly in the existing features. Here are three features created using the operators provided:

1. Interaction between Credit Duration and Amount: The amount of credit and his duration are important indicators of credit risk, if combined together, they might help capture nuances in the individual's credit usage pattern.
   - Feature: duration * credit_amount
   - RPN: {duration credit_amount multiply}

2. Employment Stability: Understanding the stability of employment can be assessed by combining employment with age, potentially capturing career stage and job stability. 
   - Feature: employment label_encoded + (age / residence_since)
   - RPN: {employment label_encode age residence_since divide plus}

3. Debt-to-Income Proxy: The installment commitment provides insight into an applicant's disposable income commitment towards debt payments. I'll create a proxy measure that combines installment commitment and savings status to assess whether savings can offset the commitment.
   - Feature: savings_status label_encode - installment_commitment
   - RPN: {savings_status label_encode installment_commitment subtract}

This feature engineering approach seeks to capture and encode patterns and interactions that may otherwise be overlooked, potentially improving the model's predictive accuracy for the downstream task.

2025-08-31 23:25:22,135 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance for the credit approval task, we should focus on generating features that encapsulate important financial behaviors and stability indicators. The features to consider are those that help capture the relationship between financial accounts, employment status, residence stability, and existing debts. Here are three new features in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), with reasoning:

1. Financial Stability Proxy: Combining checking account status and credit history, we can use a feature that reflects the financial behavior/stability of the individual. This can capture how existing credit and account status impact each other.
   - RPN: {checking_status label_encode credit_history label_encode multiply}

2. Residence and Employment Interaction: Stability in residence and employment might correlate with creditworthiness. Creating a feature that embodies this interaction can help determine stability.
   - RPN: {residence_since employment label_encode multiply}

3. Credit Dependency Analysis: The relationship between the number of existing credits and the number of dependents can give insight into the financial obligations and stress of the applicant. 
   - RPN: {existing_credits num_dependents subtract abs}

These features aim to capture various aspects of financial behavior and stability by integrating categorical and numerical inputs. Each one focuses on relationships that, when encoded effectively, could assist in making more accurate predictions regarding credit approval.

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):

2025-08-31 23:26:36,696 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the prediction model's performance, let's explore three new feature engineering strategies that utilize the top operators. We'll incorporate interactions and transformations that may capture latent patterns and associations not currently captured in the data.

1. Duration and Credit Amount Interaction with Log Transformation: 
   Given that multiplying duration and credit_amount provided some accuracy gain, let's explore a logarithmic transformation for this interaction. This transformation can help in normalizing any skewness and capture exponential relationships between these features.
   - RPN: {duration credit_amount multiply log}

2. Debt-to-Income Proxy Enhancement:
   The installment_commitment provides insight into an applicant's financial commitment. Let's enhance this by considering the employment categorical feature, converting it into a numerical feature to assess job stability against installment commitment.
   - RPN: {employment label_encode installment_commitment subtract}

3. Age and Existing Credits Ratio with a Cubic Transformation: 
   Considering age relative to existing credits can provide insights into financial maturity and credit handling experience. Applying a cubic transformation could amplify the differences among applicants with similar ratios but different life stages or credit experiences.
   - RPN: {age existing_credits ratio cube}

These features are designed to capture more of the underlying relationships that may be predictive of credit approval, especially focusing on intensifying interactions and applying transformations that make them linear or reveal hidden trends.

2025-08-31 23:28:02,987 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the predictions of whether a person receives credit, we can generate new engineered features that leverage existing data columns combined with various operations. Here's a proposed set of new features, using Reverse Polish Notation, with explanations for each:

1. Feature: Employment Stability Proxy
   - RPN: {age employment_label_encode divide}
   - Reasoning: This feature assesses the stability of employment relative to age. By dividing age by a label-encoded employment status, we capture potential job stability insights across different age groups.

2. Feature: Wealth and Dependency Assessment
   - RPN: {credit_amount num_dependents divide savings_status_label_encode plus}
   - Reasoning: This feature evaluates credit amount in relation to the number of dependents and the savings status. It helps gauge financial freedom and savings capability relative to family size and outstanding credit. It combines the credit-to-dependents ratio with savings status to understand how wealth influences credit allocation.

3. Feature: Housing Stability and Risk Profile
   - RPN: {housing_label_encode residence_since multiply existing_credits subtract}
   - Reasoning: This feature combines housing stability with historical credit risk, measured by existing credits. By multiplying housing status with the duration of residence and subtracting the number of existing credits, we gain insights into a person’s stability in their living situation and their propensity towards managing multiple credits.

These features aim to improve downstream model performance by providing richer and more complex insights into financial stability, credit risk, and personal circumstances, all of which are crucial in determining creditworthiness.

2025-08-31 23:29:25,190 - INFO - LLM Output: Given the features and the task of predicting whether a person receives credit, we can create new features that might improve the model's performance. The idea is to capture additional information or relationships that are not explicit in the existing features. Here are three new feature transformations and their explanations:

1. Feature combining purpose and job stability  
   - Purpose can impact credit approval, and combining it with job stability (employment) can help capture occupation-related financial behavior.
   - RPN: {purpose employment cross}

2. Feature to assess the influence of age and credit history on creditworthiness  
   - Age provides a sense of maturity or life stage, which coupled with credit history might influence the risk factor for credit.
   - RPN: {age credit_history label_encode multiply}

3. Proxy for financial flexibility based on property value and savings  
   - A feature that analyses an applicant's property magnitude and savings status could indicate the applicant's financial backing.
   - RPN: {property_magnitude label_encode savings_status label_encode plus}

These transformations were chosen to address different aspects of an applicant's profile that might influence their credit approval, such as occupational stability, historical credit management, and financial safety net. Improving predictions might be achieved by introducing these aspects into the model.

2025-08-31 23:31:40,653 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream prediction model's performance, we'll create three new features using the given operators and features. The logic behind the creation of these new features is to capture complex relationships and interactions between features that might not be obvious when considering them individually.

1. Credit-to-Duration Ratio:
   - Purpose: Individuals with a high credit amount but low duration might be at higher risk if deemed unable to quickly repay large sums. By considering the ratio of credit amount to duration, we capture insights related to repayment capacity.
   - RPN: {credit_amount duration divide}

2. Employment and Age Interaction:
   - Purpose: Employment status and age can interact to provide insight into job stability in relation to career stage. A high encoded employment value combined with age may indicate greater financial stability.
   - RPN: {employment label_encode age multiply}

3. Installment Impact Relative to Income:
   - Purpose: By examining the ratio of installment commitment to employment status, we can gauge how much of someone's claimed employment years (which implies income level) is committed to credit installment. A lower ratio might indicate better financial health and loan repayment capability.
   - RPN: {installment_commitment employment label_encode divide}

These features aim to capture financial behavior and stability patterns, thus enhancing the model's ability to determine creditworthiness.

2025-08-31 23:32:55,449 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream task of credit approval prediction, we will explore creating new features that capture relevant interactions and transform existing features to enhance model performance. Below are three proposed new features with their corresponding reasoning and the output in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):

1. Financial Stability Ratio:
   - Reasoning: By combining an applicant's savings status and installment commitment, we can better gauge an applicant's financial discipline. In addition, considering property magnitude gives insight into assets held by an applicant, which is another indicator of stability.
   - RPN: savings_status installment_commitment divide property_magnitude label_encode plus

2. Credit Dependency Indicator:
   - Reasoning: The number of existing credits and the employment status may help indicate financial reliance on credit and predictability. Higher credits with unstable or short employment could suggest credit dependency, whereas stability in employment might counter the dependency.
   - RPN: existing_credits employment_label_encoded multiply

3. Age and Residency Stability:
   - Reasoning: Combining age and residence duration can provide insights into the stability of an applicant. Older individuals with longer residence are likely more stable, whereas younger ones with short residency might be more transient or risky.
   - RPN: age residence_since divide

The proposed features should aid in capturing the nuances of credit risk by providing additional perspectives on applicant stability and their financial behaviors. 

Output:
 
{savings_status installment_commitment divide property_magnitude label_encode plus, existing_credits employment_label_encoded multiply, age residence_since divide}

2025-08-31 23:34:13,732 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating new features through feature engineering involves combining or transforming existing features in ways that can potentially capture more complex patterns in the data, thus improving the predictive power of the model. Here are three new features based on the operations you're allowed to use:

1. Feature capturing purchasing tendency and credit amount proportionality:
   This feature aims to understand how the purpose of credit, along with the amount, influences the decision process by capturing the interactions between different credit purposes and amounts. Since purpose is categorical, we will convert it to numerical using label encoding. 

   - RPN: {purpose label_encode credit_amount multiply}

2. Feature evaluating credit stability in conjunction with property ownership:
   It aggregates information regarding credit history and property magnitude to evaluate whether a person with specific property stakes also has stable credit history. By casting categorical features as numerical using label encoding, we can assess their interactions. 

   - RPN: {credit_history label_encode property_magnitude label_encode multiply}

3. Feature to capture economic stability through employment and savings:
   Combining employment status and savings status can reflect an individual's economic stability. We convert both categorical features to numerical representations so we can assess their relative impact on financial stability using label encoding. 

   - RPN: {employment label_encode savings_status label_encode multiply}

These newly engineered features aim to incorporate interactions between categorical variables and account for economic behaviors that potentially influence creditworthiness assessments. The combination of these features with the existing dataset should enhance the model's ability to predict credit approval accurately.

2025-08-31 23:36:23,033 - INFO - LLM Output: To create new features that improve the model's performance in credit prediction, we will leverage both the categorical and numerical features through innovative transformations and combinations. Here are three feature-engineering strategies, explained with their reasoning and followed by their respective Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):

1. Interaction Between Employment and Economic Stability: We intend to capture the complex relationships between employment status, age, and savings status. Transforming employment and savings_status into numerical features allows us to explore more nuanced interactions. 
   - RPN: {employment label_encode savings_status label_encode multiply age plus}

2. Risk Assessed by Credit Amount Relative to Existing Credits: Combining credit amount with the number of existing credits might provide insights into how a customer's existing credit burden compares with their current credit amount application. This relation could indicate either risk acceptance or financial stability when requesting additional credit.
   - RPN: {credit_amount existing_credits divide}

3. Duration Adjusted for Personal Status Stability: Evaluating credit duration in conjunction with personal status could indicate how a person with certain personal status stability is managing longer credit durations. By aggregating personal_status into a numerical feature through label encoding, and then using it in conjunction with duration, we can measure potential stability in handling credits.
   - RPN: {personal_status label_encode duration multiply}

These feature-engineering strategies aim to capture interactions between financial stability variables, credit burden assessment, and personal status impacts on managing credit durations, potentially yielding better predictions.

2025-08-31 23:38:37,632 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that can potentially enhance the predictions, we'll focus on combining features that have shown some correlation with a positive outcome and perform operations that can reveal underlying patterns. Based on the given features and operators, I'll propose three new features:

1. The interaction between duration and checking_status could highlight risk associated with longer credit durations and unstable account status. We will use a category interaction by first encoding checking_status.

2. The existing stability captured through credit_history alongside employment might provide insights into a person's ability to manage credit. This would involve encoding both features and combining them.

3. Assessing disposable income against credit usage by combining installment_commitment with credit_amount could show the economic pressure on the applicant, especially in a debt-to-commitment aspect.

Here's how they can be represented in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):

json
{
    duration checking_status label_encode cross, 
    credit_history label_encode employment label_encode multiply, 
    installment_commitment credit_amount multiply
}


### Reasoning:

1. duration checking_status label_encode cross: By cross-multiplying the duration of credit with the checking account status as a numerical label, we may see how different account statuses affect people with various loan periods.

2. credit_history label_encode employment label_encode multiply: This feature evaluates the interaction between credit stability and employment status by multiplying their label encoded forms. It might show whether individuals with particular employment statuses also maintain consistent credit histories.

3. installment_commitment credit_amount multiply: This new feature provides insight into how much financial strain a person's credit imposes in relation to their disposable income commitment percentage, potentially revealing an applicant's debt-management capacity.
