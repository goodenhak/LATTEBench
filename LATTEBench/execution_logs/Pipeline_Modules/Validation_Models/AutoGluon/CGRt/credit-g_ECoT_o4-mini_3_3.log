2025-09-01 00:15:54,994 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three ideas for new signals:

1. Relative loan size within each purpose category: borrowers taking loans much larger than the average for their stated purpose may be higher risk.  
2. Combined “total commitment” proxy: multiplying the installment rate by the duration captures overall repayment load.  
3. Age‐to‐term ratio: younger applicants with long terms may be riskier, so the ratio of age to duration highlights that.

RPN expressions for these features:
{purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean credit_amount divide, installment_commitment duration multiply, age duration divide}

2025-09-01 00:23:22,509 - INFO - LLM Output: We propose the following three new numerical features:

1. “Relative pressure” = credit_amount_duration_ratio ÷ installment_commitment  
   Captures how heavy the applicant’s debt per month (already normalized by duration) is once you account for their installment rate; high values indicate disproportionate debt burden.

2. “Employment‐normalized credit” = credit_amount ÷ (mean credit_amount for that employment category)  
   Measures how the individual’s requested amount stands relative to peers in the same employment class; deviations may signal over‐ or under‐confidence in repayment.

3. “Log total commitment” = log(installment_commitment_duration_multiply)  
   Applies a log transform to the product of installment rate and duration to stabilize skew and highlight multiplicative effects on total commitment.

2025-09-01 00:27:42,372 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features designed to capture different interactions:

1. Normalize loan size by total installment burden  
   We already know that both credit_amount and installment_commitment_duration_multiply are strong predictors; dividing one by the other highlights loans that are large relative to the total payment obligation.  

2. Purpose‐by‐term bin target encoding  
   Different loan purposes perform differently at different term lengths. By crossing the 4‐bin duration feature with purpose and then target‐encoding them, we give the model a smooth estimate of approval probability for each (purpose, term‐bin) combination.  

3. Weight burden by borrower’s historical default risk  
   Combining the credit burden ratio (credit_amount_duration_ratio) with the purpose‐credit_history target encoding further adjusts the raw burden by the riskiness of a given purpose+history pair.  

RPN expressions for these features:  
{credit_amount installment_commitment_duration_multiply divide, purpose duration_4_bin cross target_encoding, credit_amount_duration_ratio purpose_credit_history_cross_target_encoding multiply}

2025-09-01 00:33:10,320 - INFO - LLM Output: Reasoning:

1. We know “credit_amount” and “credit_amount_duration_ratio” are both strong predictors and interact non-linearly. Taking their product and then a log helps capture that interaction while controlling skew.  
2. Grouping “credit_amount_duration_ratio” by “purpose” (via groupby‐mean) lets the model learn average repayment rate differences across loan purposes.  
3. Interacting the combined “checking_status_savings_status_cross” (label‐encoded) with “credit_amount_duration_ratio” captures how different checking/savings profiles modulate payment rates.
