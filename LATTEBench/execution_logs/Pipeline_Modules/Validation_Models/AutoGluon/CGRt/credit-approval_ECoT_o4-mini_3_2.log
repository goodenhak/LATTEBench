2. Employment Tenure Ratio (YearsEmployed Age ratio): captures job stability normalized by age, reflecting career consistency.
3. Industry Default Rate (Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean): a target‐encoding that assigns each industry its average prior default rate, incorporating segment‐level risk.

1. Z-scoring the raw CreditScore stabilizes its scale and reduces skew, improving model convergence.
2. Computing the mean CreditScore per Industry (Industry CreditScore groupbythenmean) captures sector-specific creditworthiness baselines.
3. The Debt-to-Income ratio (Debt Income divide) is a classic risk indicator combining two key financial metrics.

2025-09-01 09:35:05,474 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three candidates that should help the model:

1. Log-Income (Income + 1 → log) to reduce skewness and dampen the huge range of incomes.  
2. Debt-to-Income ratio (Debt / Income) since higher DTI often implies higher credit risk.  
3. Industry×Ethnicity target-encoded prior default rate, capturing group-level default propensities.

1. Industry‐level default rate (Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean)  
   • Captures how risky a given job sector is historically—borrowers from high‐default industries may be less likely to be approved.  

2. Debt‐to‐Income ratio (Debt Income ratio)  
   • Directly measures an applicant’s debt burden relative to their earning power—a key indicator for creditworthiness.  

3. Ethnicity‐specific median credit score (Ethnicity CreditScore groupbythenmedian)  
   • Reflects typical credit quality within each ethnic group, allowing the model to adjust expectations based on demographic norms.

2025-09-01 09:39:56,788 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features designed to capture financial pressure, credit‐to‐debt efficiency, and industry‐level default risk:

1. Debt‐to‐Income Ratio (higher means more burdened by debt relative to income).  
2. CreditScore‐to‐Debt Ratio (higher means better credit health per unit of debt).  
3. Industry‐level PriorDefault Rate (captures systematic default risk by sector).

RPN expressions for these features:
{Debt Income ratio, CreditScore Debt ratio, Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean}

2025-09-01 09:41:04,127 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three engineered features with their motivations:

1. Debt-to-Income Ratio (Debt Income divide)  
   Reasoning: Measures the burden of outstanding debt relative to earnings — a classic creditworthiness indicator.

2. Employment Tenure Ratio (YearsEmployed Age divide)  
   Reasoning: Captures stability by comparing how long someone has worked versus their age; a higher ratio suggests more established employment.

3. Industry Default Rate (Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean)  
   Reasoning: Encodes the average prior‐default rate within each industry, giving a proxy for sector‐level risk.
