Age YearsEmployed multiply log, 
Income Debt ratio log, 
Age YearsEmployed plus log Income Debt plus log multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed multiply log: This creates a multiplicative interaction between Age and YearsEmployed, which captures the combined effect of experience and maturity. Taking the log helps normalize the distribution since both Age and YearsEmployed have right-skewed distributions (as evidenced by their Q3 values being much higher than their medians).

2. Income Debt ratio log: The existing Age_Debt_ratio has an extremely high range and standard deviation, indicating outliers. Creating Income/Debt ratio focuses on the critical financial capacity metric (income relative to debt burden), and the log transformation normalizes this highly skewed feature.

3. Age YearsEmployed plus log Income Debt plus log multiply: This creates an interaction between two already useful features (Age_YearsEmployed_plus_log and Income_Debt_plus_log) that were in the top-performing feature set. Multiplying these two normalized features may capture non-linear interactions between age/experience and income/debt factors that are predictive of creditworthiness.

These features focus on:
- Financial capacity (income/debt ratio)
- Experience and maturity (age × employment)
- Interactions between proven effective features
- Appropriate normalization through log transformations for skewed distributions
- Avoiding operations on categorical features as instructed

2025-09-01 07:37:19,330 - INFO - LLM Output: {Income Debt ratio log Age_YearsEmployed_plus_log multiply, YearsEmployed Employed cross CreditScore PriorDefault cross concat, Age_YearsEmployed_plus_log Income_Debt_plus_log multiply Age_YearsEmployed_multiply_log multiply}

Reasoning:
1. Income_Debt_ratio_log Age_YearsEmployed_plus_log multiply: This combines the log-transformed income-to-debt ratio (financial stability indicator) with the log-transformed age and employment sum (experience indicator). The multiplication creates an interaction term that captures how financial stability and experience jointly influence creditworthiness.

2. YearsEmployed_Employed_cross CreditScore_PriorDefault_cross concat: This concatenates two powerful categorical cross features - employment status with years employed (showing employment stability patterns) and credit score with prior defaults (showing risk patterns). Combining these provides a comprehensive view of both employment history and credit risk behavior.

3. Age_YearsEmployed_plus_log Income_Debt_plus_log multiply Age_YearsEmployed_multiply_log multiply: This creates a triple interaction term combining: (age + employment experience) × (income + debt stability) × (age × employment multiplicative effect). This complex interaction captures sophisticated non-linear relationships between age, employment, income, and debt that individual features might miss.

These features leverage the most informative existing engineered features while creating higher-order interactions that can capture complex decision boundaries for credit approval prediction. The combination focuses on employment stability, financial health, and their interactions with demographic factors.
