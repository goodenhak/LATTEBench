Explanation:

1. age checking_status cross label_encode: This feature combines the age of the applicant with the status of their checking account. By crossing these features and label encoding the result, we capture potential interactions between age and financial stability as indicated by their checking account status. Younger applicants with higher checking account balances might be viewed more favorably, whereas older applicants with low balances might be less favored.

2. credit_amount credit_history cross label_encode: By combining the credit amount with the applicant's credit history, we aim to capture the interplay between the size of the requested credit and their credit history. For example, a large loan requested by someone with a good credit history might be viewed differently from the same amount requested by someone with a poor credit track record.

3. housing employment cross label_encode groupbythenmean: This feature looks at the average employment status of individuals within different housing situations. Employment is indicative of financial stability, while housing can reflect wealth accumulation. Calculating the average employment for each housing category can provide insight into the typical financial stability associated with different housing circumstances, useful for predicting creditworthiness.

2025-08-31 22:48:10,241 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features aimed at improving prediction accuracy, we will focus on combining existing features using operators that induce meaningful transformations or aggregations. Here's the reasoning and RPN expressions for three new features:

1. Duration to Age Ratio: The ratio between duration and age can capture relative temporal dynamics between the credit duration and the applicant's age, potentially providing insights into the applicant's life stage concerning the credit duration.
   - RPN: {duration age ratio}

2. Credit History Aggregation for Installment Commitment: By grouping on credit history and calculating the mean installment commitment, we can create a feature that reflects the average financial burden for similar credit histories, helping to classify applicants better based on their past credit behavior.
   - RPN: {credit_history installment_commitment groupbythenmean}

3. Employment and Savings Interaction: By converting employment and savings status into numerical form and crossing them, we can build a feature representing potential financial stability based on combined employment duration and savings status—valuable for gauging creditworthiness.
   - RPN: {employment label_encode savings_status label_encode cross}

These features are designed to enhance the model's predictive capabilities by leveraging relationships and aggregations in the data that may provide deeper insights into the applicant's financial behaviors and situation.

2025-08-31 22:49:26,748 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we should focus on generating features that capture meaningful interactions between variables, provide normalized or relative scales, and reflect underlying relationships not immediately obvious in the raw data. Based on the provided features and operators, here are three new features:

1. A feature that captures the interaction between income-related factors and the customer's age, reflecting a relative financial responsibility or risk:
   - It's crucial to understand how much of their income (captured by installment commitment) is being consumed relative to their age, which might reflect financial maturity or burden.
   - RPN: {installment_commitment age divide}

2. A feature that captures the effect of credit history over the duration of the credit, which can reflect how historical behavior impacts planned credit span:
   - Understanding how credit history categories impact or are distributed over different durations can provide insights into risk over short and long terms.
   - RPN: {credit_history duration groupbythenmean}

3. A feature that combines the current checking account status with savings to understand immediate liquidity:
   - The combination of checking status and savings provides a clearer picture of the immediate financial liquidity.
   - RPN: {checking_status savings_status cross}

These features are intended to capture the dynamics of financial behavior through interactions and normalizations that may lead to a more insightful model for credit approval predictions.

2025-08-31 22:50:36,004 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance in predicting credit approval, we will generate three new features using advanced feature engineering techniques. 

1. RPN 1: Create a feature that captures the variability of credit amount within different credit history categories. This gives insights into the typical credit amount for each category, which can be useful for understanding risk levels associated with different credit histories.

   RPN: {credit_history credit_amount groupbythenstd}

2. RPN 2: Generate a feature that represents the normalized age of the applicant. Standardizing age can help the model treat age-related discrepancies appropriately, providing a uniform scale to assess age impact on credit approval.

   RPN: {age zscore}

3. RPN 3: Incorporate a feature that evaluates the employment duration minus residence duration, giving insight into the applicant's stability. Longer employment to residence duration could indicate a stable lifestyle which might be favorable for credit approval.

   RPN: {employment residence_since subtract}

Each of these features captures different dimensions of risk and stability, which are crucial in assessing creditworthiness. By introducing these features, the model can leverage more precise and contextually rich information, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

2025-08-31 22:51:43,001 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the predictions of whether a person receives credit, we will create three new features using feature engineering operators. These features aim to capture meaningful interactions or transformations that are likely to correlate with credit approval.

1. Purpose and Credit History Interaction  
The purpose of the credit and credit history might interact in complex ways affecting credit approval. Let's create a feature to capture this interaction by cross joining these two categorical features.  

RPN Expression:
{purpose credit_history cross}

2. Duration Z-Score Transformation  
To standardize the duration feature across the dataset, we will apply a z-score transformation to it. This highlights the duration relative to the average duration and standard deviation, potentially making it more interpretable for downstream tasks.  

RPN Expression:
{duration zscore}

3. Age and Employment Interaction  
Employment and age may jointly impact credit approval due to the interconnected nature of work experience and age. By cross joining age and employment status, we create a feature that captures this interaction.  

RPN Expression:
{age employment bin cross}

Final Output:
{purpose credit_history cross, duration zscore, age employment bin cross}

2025-08-31 22:53:04,727 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance, we should consider both numerical feature transformations that capture non-linearities and interactions, as well as interactions between categorical features. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Interaction between Credit History and Purpose: Since the top existing feature is an interaction between purpose and credit_history, creating another feature by involving these two can further improve the model. A cross operation can capture interactions between two categorical features. 

2. Duration-based feature using numerical transformation: Given that duration already has a computed z-score, applying a non-linear transformation could capture some variations in duration. Using the exponential function could accentuate higher durations.

3. Employment and Credit History Interaction: Combining employment and credit_history can provide insight into the reliability of a person's employment history in relation to their credit behavior. This is a cross operation as well.

Here's the RPN representation for these newly engineered features:

1. Purpose and Credit History Interaction (distinct from existing top 1):
   - Utilize cross operation to find different combinations that may better explain the target variable.

2. Exponential Transformation on Duration Z-score:
   - This can help model exponential growth in credit risk associated with longer loan durations.

3. Employment and Credit History Interaction:
   - This captures the relationship between a person's employment tenure and their credit history.

Here are the RPN expressions for the new features:

2025-08-31 22:55:44,657 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that can potentially improve the model's performance, we need to consider interactions between categorical features and transformations of numerical features. Here are three new feature ideas:

1. Purpose and Credit History Interaction Cross Feature:
   - Given the existing top feature, we can leverage more interactions between categorical features for a potential improvement in predictive power.
   - RPN: {purpose credit_history cross}

2. Duration Normalization and Cosine Transform:
   - Numerical transformation of duration using cosine can capture non-linear patterns. The duration feature is central to credit assessment, so enhancing the non-linear patterns may improve prediction accuracy.
   - Normalizing (z-score) and applying the cosine transformation can help capture seasonality or cyclic patterns in the data.
   - RPN: {duration zscore cosine}

3. Numerical Encoding of Property Magnitude Followed by Log Transformation:
   - Convert property_magnitude to numerical values using label encoding, then apply log transformation to modulate skewness and compress the range.
   - This transformation can potentially highlight differences in credit worthiness based on the type of property owned.
   - RPN: {property_magnitude label_encode log}

Combining these feature transformations with the given existing features should provide additional interactions and transformations that can support the predictive model in making more accurate decisions.
