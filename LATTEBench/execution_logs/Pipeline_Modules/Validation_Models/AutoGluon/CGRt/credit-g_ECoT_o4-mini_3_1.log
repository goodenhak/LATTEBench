2025-08-31 23:43:55,369 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three engineered features designed to capture different aspects of borrower risk:

1.  Monthly payment load (per‐month obligation):  
    – credit_amount / duration gives the average monthly principal burden.  
    – Helps differentiate high‐ versus low‐stress loans.  

2.  Relative loan size within same purpose:  
    – Compute the mean loan amount for each purpose, then take the ratio of an individual’s credit to that mean.  
    – Flags applicants taking an unusually large loan for the same purpose.  

3.  Combined liquidity indicator:  
    – Cross the two account–based categories (checking_status × savings_status) and label‐encode.  
    – Captures joint effect of both on overall short‐term liquidity.  

Final RPN expressions for these features:

2025-08-31 23:46:41,191 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features with their motivation:

1. “Monthly payment” (credit_amount/duration) captures how burdensome the loan is per month; applying a log stabilizes its skew.  
2. Crossing checking_status with savings_status encodes combined liquidity signals.  
3. Per-job average credit amount (job → mean(credit_amount)) reflects typical borrowing behavior by occupation.

RPN expressions:
{credit_amount duration divide log, checking_status savings_status cross, job credit_amount groupbythenmean}

2025-08-31 23:52:58,504 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three candidate features with their motivations:

1. “Debt‐service intensity”: by exponentiating the existing log credit‐to‐duration ratio back to a linear scale and then scaling by the borrower’s installment rate, we capture how heavily serviced the debt is relative to income.  
2. “Loan size vs. age”: by taking the ratio of credit amount to age (and logging it), we gauge whether older clients take proportionally larger or smaller loans.  
3. “Typical loan by personal status”: by grouping credit_amount by personal_status and taking the median, we embed the typical loan size for each marital/sex category.

Reverse Polish Notation for these three features:

2025-08-31 23:54:58,009 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features designed to capture deviations from group‐level norms and aggregate behavior patterns:

1. Deviation of an individual’s requested amount from the average amount for people in the same job  
   Rationale: If someone requests much more or much less credit than their peers in the same job category, it may signal atypical risk.  
2. Typical loan duration for each job category  
   Rationale: Different occupations tend to take loans over different horizons. Knowing the “normal” duration for each job helps flag outliers.  
3. Typical credit amount for each credit‐history profile  
   Rationale: Credit history groups (e.g. “all paid” vs “delayed”) have different average borrowings. Comparing against these averages highlights unusual demands.
