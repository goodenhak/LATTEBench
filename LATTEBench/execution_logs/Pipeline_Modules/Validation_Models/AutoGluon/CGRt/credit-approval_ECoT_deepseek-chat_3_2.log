2025-09-01 07:52:42,720 - INFO - LLM Output: {
Age Debt ratio, YearsEmployed Employed multiply, CreditScore PriorDefault subtract
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio: The ratio of Age to Debt could capture the relative burden of debt at different life stages. Younger applicants with high debt might be riskier, while older applicants with similar debt levels might be more stable. This interaction could improve predictive power beyond using Age and Debt separately.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: This creates an interaction term that amplifies the effect of employment status. For employed individuals (Employed=1), this feature preserves their years of employment value. For unemployed individuals (Employed=0), this feature becomes 0, clearly distinguishing them. This could better capture employment stability than either feature alone.

3. CreditScore PriorDefault subtract: This creates a feature that represents creditworthiness adjusted for prior defaults. Applicants with high credit scores but prior defaults might be treated differently than those with high scores and no defaults. This differential could help the model make more nuanced predictions about credit card approval likelihood.

Age Debt ratio log,

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: Creates a normalized debt-to-age ratio that captures financial responsibility relative to life stage, then applies log transformation to handle skewness. This could be predictive as younger people with high debt may be riskier.

2. YearsEmployed Employed cross: Creates interaction between employment duration and current employment status. Those with many years of experience but currently unemployed may represent different risk profiles than those consistently employed.

3. CreditScore PriorDefault multiply Income multiply: Multiplies credit score by prior default status (which acts as a penalty multiplier) and then by income. This creates a comprehensive risk score where good credit and high income are positive, but prior defaults severely penalize the score, potentially creating a powerful predictive feature.

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: Creates a normalized debt-to-age ratio that captures financial responsibility relative to life stage, then applies log transformation to handle skewness. This helps identify applicants who have manageable debt levels for their age.

2. YearsEmployed Employed cross: Creates interaction between employment duration and current employment status. This captures nuanced employment patterns where someone might have significant work experience but is currently unemployed, which could be predictive of creditworthiness.

3. CreditScore Income ratio sigmoid: Creates a credit-to-income ratio that measures creditworthiness relative to earning capacity, then applies sigmoid to bound the values between 0-1. This helps identify applicants with strong credit profiles relative to their income levels.

Age Debt ratio log,

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: The ratio of Age to Debt may indicate financial stability relative to life stage. Taking the log helps normalize the distribution and handle extreme values, which could be predictive of creditworthiness.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore plus: This creates a composite employment stability score. Multiplying YearsEmployed by Employed (0 or 1) ensures only employed individuals get credit for their tenure, then adding CreditScore creates a combined measure of employment history and creditworthiness.

3. PriorDefault CreditScore multiply negate exp: This creates a risk penalty feature. Multiplying PriorDefault (0 or 1) by CreditScore gives a measure of how bad a default was relative to credit score, negating it makes higher values indicate higher risk, and exp() transforms it to a positive scale that may better interact with other features in the model.

Age Debt ratio log,

}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: Creates a normalized debt-to-age ratio that captures financial burden relative to life stage, then applies log transformation to handle skewness. This could help identify applicants with unusually high debt for their age.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: Creates an interaction term that is non-zero only for employed individuals, representing their actual work experience. This distinguishes between unemployed (0), newly employed (low values), and long-term employed (higher values).

3. CreditScore Debt subtract abs: Measures the absolute discrepancy between credit score and debt level. A large gap (either positive or negative) might indicate unusual financial situations that could affect credit card approval decisions.

Age Debt ratio, Income CreditScore multiply, YearsEmployed Employed multiply

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio: Debt-to-income ratio is a key factor in creditworthiness assessments. By calculating the ratio of debt to age (as a proxy for financial maturity/experience), we can capture an important risk metric that lenders use. Younger applicants with high debt may be riskier.

2. Income CreditScore multiply: This interaction feature combines two strong predictors - income and credit score. Applicants with both high income and high credit scores are much more likely to be approved, while those with low values in both are higher risk. The multiplication amplifies this effect.

3. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: This creates a feature that's only non-zero for employed individuals, with the value representing their years of employment. This distinguishes between unemployed (0), newly employed (low values), and long-term employed (high values), with employment stability being a crucial factor in credit decisions.
