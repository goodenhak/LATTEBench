2025-09-01 03:59:15,506 - INFO - LLM Output: {
nHM nO plus log, nN nX plus log, nHDon nO plus log
}

Reasoning:
1. nHM (number of heavy atoms) and nO (number of oxygen atoms) are both fundamental molecular properties that influence biodegradability. Their sum represents total heavy atom count including oxygen, and taking the log helps normalize the distribution and handle the right-skewed nature of atom counts.

2. nN (number of nitrogen atoms) and nX (number of halogen atoms) are both elements that often hinder biodegradation. Nitrogen-containing compounds (amines, nitro groups) and halogenated compounds are typically more resistant to biodegradation. Their sum represents a hard-to-degrade elements count, and the log transform helps create a more normally distributed feature.

3. nHDon (hydrogen bond donors) and nO (oxygen atoms) both contribute to a molecule's hydrophilicity and ability to form hydrogen bonds, which can enhance biodegradability by making the compound more water-soluble and accessible to enzymes. Their sum represents total hydrogen bonding capacity, with log transform for normalization.

These features capture important chemical properties related to biodegradability: total molecular size, presence of recalcitrant elements, and hydrophilic/hydrogen bonding characteristics - all of which are known to significantly influence biodegradation rates.

2025-09-01 04:01:02,814 - INFO - LLM Output: {
nO nHDon plus, nCb- nHM plus, nX nN plus
}

Reasoning:
1. nO nHDon plus: Oxygen atoms and hydrogen bond donors (N and O) are both important for biodegradability as they relate to hydrophilicity and potential for microbial attack. Summing them creates a combined measure of polar functionality.

2. nCb- nHM plus: Substituted benzene carbons and heavy atoms both indicate molecular complexity and aromaticity, which can hinder biodegradation. Their sum provides a composite measure of structural complexity.

3. nX nN plus: Halogen atoms and nitrogen atoms are both known to often decrease biodegradability (e.g., halogenated compounds and certain nitrogen-containing groups are persistent). Their sum creates a feature capturing potential recalcitrant elements.

These features combine chemically relevant properties that are known to influence biodegradability, creating more informative composite descriptors that could help the model better distinguish between biodegradable and non-biodegradable compounds.

nO nHDon plus, nCb- nHM subtract, nO nHDon multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. nO nHDon plus: Oxygen atoms and hydrogen bond donors (N and O) are both important for biodegradability as they relate to water solubility and potential for microbial attack. Summing them creates a combined polar functionality feature that may better capture the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and interact with water.

2. nCb- nHM subtract: The difference between substituted benzene carbons and heavy atoms could indicate the aromaticity relative to molecular size. Aromatic compounds are typically more resistant to biodegradation, so this feature might help distinguish aromatic-rich vs aliphatic molecules.

3. nO nHDon multiply: Multiplying oxygen count by hydrogen bond donors creates an interaction term that emphasizes molecules with both oxygen functionality and hydrogen bonding capability, which are key characteristics for biodegradability as they indicate hydrophilic regions that enzymes can access.

2025-09-01 04:09:03,689 - INFO - LLM Output: {
nO nHDon plus, nCb- nCp plus, nN nX plus
}

Reasoning:
1. nO nHDon plus: Oxygen atoms and hydrogen bond donors (N and O) are both important for biodegradability as they relate to water solubility and hydrogen bonding potential. Summing them creates a combined feature that captures overall polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity, which are key factors in microbial degradation.

2. nCb- nCp plus: Substituted benzene carbons (aromatic) and terminal primary carbons (aliphatic) represent different types of carbon structures. Their sum provides a measure of overall carbon complexity and branching, which affects biodegradation rates as branched and aromatic compounds are typically more resistant to degradation.

3. nN nX plus: Nitrogen atoms and halogen atoms are both elements that often make compounds more resistant to biodegradation. Nitrogen-containing functional groups (like amines) and halogenated compounds are frequently persistent in the environment. Their sum creates a feature that captures the presence of these recalcitrant elements.

nO nN plus nHDon subtract, nX nHM plus nHDon subtract, nCb- nCp plus nHDon subtract
}

Reasoning:
1. The first feature nO nN plus nHDon subtract creates a net hydrogen bond acceptor count by subtracting the number of hydrogen bond donors (nHDon) from the total number of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (which are potential hydrogen bond acceptors). This could be important for biodegradability as hydrogen bonding affects solubility and molecular interactions.

2. The second feature nX nHM plus nHDon subtract creates a halogen and heavy atom adjusted hydrogen bond metric by subtracting hydrogen bond donors from the sum of halogen atoms and heavy atoms. Halogens and heavy atoms often reduce biodegradability, while hydrogen bonding can enhance it, making this a potentially useful interaction term.

3. The third feature nCb- nCp plus nHDon subtract combines aromatic carbon substitution (nCb-) with terminal primary carbons (nCp) and adjusts for hydrogen bonding. This captures both aromaticity and chain termination effects while accounting for hydrogen bonding capacity, which could influence biodegradation pathways.

These features combine atomic composition and bonding characteristics in ways that may better capture the complex relationships affecting biodegradability than the individual features alone.

}

Reasoning:
1. The current top features are interaction terms between oxygen, nitrogen, halogen atoms, heavy atoms, and hydrogen bond donors. These likely capture important molecular properties related to biodegradability.

2. The first feature multiplies all three existing interaction terms together, creating a higher-order interaction that might capture synergistic effects between these molecular properties that aren't captured by individual terms.

3. The second feature sums all three interaction terms, creating a comprehensive molecular complexity score that aggregates different aspects of the molecule's structure that influence biodegradability.

4. The third feature takes the logarithm of the product of the interaction terms, which can help normalize the distribution and handle the multiplicative scaling while maintaining the interaction effects.

These combinations build upon the existing successful features by creating more complex interactions and aggregations that might better capture the nonlinear relationships between molecular properties and biodegradability.

Answer: 1.0


Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):
top 1: new features = {nO nN plus nHDon subtract,  nX nHM plus nHDon subtract,  nCb- nCp plus nHDon subtract}, score = 0.004739336492890933

}

Reasoning:
1. The top existing features are already interaction terms between different atomic counts and donor atoms. To improve upon these, I'm creating multiplicative interactions between these top features to capture more complex, non-linear relationships.

2. The first feature multiplies the oxygen/nitrogen/donor interaction with the halogen/heavy-atom/donor interaction, then applies a log transform to handle the potentially skewed distribution and create a more Gaussian-like feature.

3. The second feature creates a reciprocal of the product between benzene-substituted/terminal-primary/donor and oxygen/nitrogen/donor interactions, which could highlight inverse relationships that might be predictive for certain molecular configurations.

4. The third feature multiplies the halogen/heavy-atom/donor interaction with the benzene-substituted/terminal-primary/donor interaction and applies a square root to moderate extreme values while preserving the interaction effect.

These multiplicative interactions capture higher-order relationships between different molecular properties that single features or additive combinations might miss, potentially improving the model's ability to distinguish biodegradable from non-biodegradable compounds.
