credit_amount duration multiply sqrt, 
checking_status credit_history cross employment cross, 
credit_amount savings_status cross age multiply log
}

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply sqrt: 
   - Instead of just ratio, multiplying credit_amount by duration captures total exposure, then sqrt to reduce skewness while preserving monotonicity.
   - This creates a more robust numerical feature that captures the overall magnitude of the credit request.

2. checking_status credit_history cross employment cross:
   - Creates a three-way interaction between checking status, credit history, and employment.
   - These are all important categorical features that likely have complex interactions affecting creditworthiness.
   - A three-way cross may reveal more specific patterns than the existing two-way crosses.

3. credit_amount savings_status cross age multiply log:
   - Combines the existing credit_amount_savings_status cross with age (an important numerical feature).
   - Multiplying by age captures how credit amount requirements might vary by life stage.
   - Log transformation helps normalize the distribution and handle extreme values.

These features create more complex interactions while maintaining interpretability through appropriate transformations. The three-way categorical cross may reveal more specific risk profiles, while the numerical interactions with age and sqrt transformations help capture non-linear relationships in a stable way.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply sqrt: Creates a non-linear combination of two key numerical features (credit amount and duration) that captures the overall exposure of the loan, which is then square-root transformed to reduce skewness and make the relationship more linear with the target.

2. checking_status credit_history cross savings_status concat: Builds on the existing successful cross feature by further incorporating savings_status, creating a more comprehensive financial stability profile that combines checking account status, credit history, and savings behavior.

3. age duration credit_amount multiply ratio: Creates a personalized risk assessment feature by comparing the applicant's age against the total loan exposure (duration × amount), which may capture life stage risk factors relative to the loan size.

2025-08-31 20:48:30,981 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the analysis of the current top features and the available data, I will create three new features that capture different aspects of credit risk assessment:

1. Age to Duration Ratio: This feature captures whether older applicants are taking shorter-term loans (potentially more conservative) vs younger applicants taking longer-term loans. This ratio could reveal life stage patterns in credit behavior.

2. Employment Status and Credit History Cross: Combining employment stability with credit history provides a powerful risk indicator. Long-term employment with good credit history suggests reliability, while unstable employment with poor credit suggests higher risk.

3. Credit Amount to Savings Ratio (encoded): This measures the leverage ratio - how much credit someone is seeking relative to their savings. High leverage (large credit relative to small savings) indicates higher risk, which we'll bin to capture nonlinear relationships.

2025-08-31 20:50:14,961 - INFO - LLM Output: {
credit_amount duration subtract reciprocal, 
checking_status credit_history cross employment cross, 
credit_amount savings_status cross age multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration subtract reciprocal: 
   - Instead of ratio (division), using subtract then reciprocal creates a different nonlinear transformation that might capture complementary patterns. The reciprocal emphasizes smaller differences which could be informative for risk assessment.

2. checking_status credit_history cross employment cross: 
   - Creating a three-way cross between checking_status, credit_history, and employment could reveal more specific risk profiles. For example, someone with no checking + critical credit history + unemployed would be extremely high risk.

3. credit_amount savings_status cross age multiply: 
   - Multiplying the credit_amount_savings_status interaction with age creates a weighted feature where the same credit amount/savings combination has different implications for different age groups. Older individuals with large credits and low savings might be riskier than younger ones.

These features introduce:
- Additional nonlinear transformations (reciprocal)
- Higher-order interactions (three-way cross)
- Age-weighted credit/savings profiles
All of which could help the model capture more complex decision boundaries in the credit approval process.
