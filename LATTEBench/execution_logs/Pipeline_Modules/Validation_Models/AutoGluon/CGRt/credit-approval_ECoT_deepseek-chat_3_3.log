Reasoning:
1. Age Debt multiply: Creates an interaction feature that combines age and debt, which may capture lifecycle financial patterns (e.g., younger people with high debt vs older people with high debt have different risk profiles).

2. Income Employed cross: Creates a categorical interaction between income (binned) and employment status, which could reveal patterns like high income but unemployed (risky) vs low income but employed (potentially less risky).

3. Citizen PriorDefault groupbythenmean: Uses citizenship status to group and calculate the mean default rate, which may reveal that certain citizenship categories have systematically different default behaviors that aren't captured by the raw citizenship feature alone.

Age Debt multiply Income divide, 
Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean Employed multiply, 
YearsEmployed Employed cross Citizen cross
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt multiply Income divide: This creates a debt-to-income ratio adjusted by age, which could capture financial responsibility patterns across different life stages. Older individuals with high debt relative to income might be riskier, while younger ones might be more acceptable.

2. Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean Employed multiply: This enhances the industry default rate feature by interacting it with employment status. Employed individuals in high-default industries might still be good candidates, while unemployed ones in those industries could be particularly risky.

3. YearsEmployed Employed cross Citizen cross: This creates a powerful interaction between employment duration, employment status, and citizenship. Temporary citizens with short employment or unemployment might be highest risk, while long-employed native citizens could be safest. The cross operator handles the categorical nature effectively.

Age Debt multiply,

}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt multiply: Creates an interaction term between Age and Debt, which could capture life-stage financial responsibility patterns that might be predictive of creditworthiness beyond the individual features.

2. Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean Income multiply: Multiplies the industry-level default rate by individual income. This creates a risk-weighted income feature where high income in low-default industries gets amplified while high income in high-default industries gets moderated, potentially capturing nuanced risk patterns.

3. YearsEmployed Employed cross Age Debt multiply concat: Creates a composite feature that combines employment status (cross of years employed and employment status) with the age-debt interaction. This captures complex relationships between employment history, life stage, debt burden, and creditworthiness in a single feature.

These features were designed to:
- Create meaningful interactions between risk indicators (default rates, employment status)
- Incorporate both individual and group-level information
- Capture non-linear relationships through multiplication of scaled features
- Maintain interpretability while creating powerful predictive signals
- Leverage the most informative existing features (Age, Debt, Industry default rates, Employment) in novel combinations

Reasoning:
1. Industry_PriorDefault_groupbythenmean Debt multiply: Combines the industry-specific default risk with the individual's debt level. This creates a weighted debt feature that accounts for industry risk factors, which should be more predictive than debt alone.

2. Age_Debt_ratio YearsEmployed multiply: Multiplies the age-to-debt ratio (financial responsibility indicator) with years employed (stability indicator). This creates a compound stability feature that captures both financial management and employment history.

3. YearsEmployed_Employed_cross_Citizen_cross label_encode: Converts the complex categorical cross feature into a numerical representation using label encoding. This preserves the information from the employment-citizenship interaction while making it usable for numerical models, as categorical features with many categories can be challenging to handle directly.

These features leverage interactions between existing powerful features (like the groupbythenmean and ratio features) while converting complex categorical crosses into numerical formats that are more easily consumed by downstream models.
