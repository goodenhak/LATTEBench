Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):
top 1: new features = {checking_status credit_history cross savings_status cross purpose cross, duration credit_amount ratio age multiply installment_commitment multiply, credit_amount duration multiply age multiply 10000 divide existing_credits multiply}, score = 0.030000000000000027
top 2: new features = {checking_status credit_history cross,  duration credit_amount ratio,  age duration multiply credit_amount divide 100 multiply}, score = 0.010000000000000009
top 3: new features = {checking_status credit_history cross savings_status cross,  duration credit_amount ratio age multiply,  credit_amount duration multiply age multiply 10000 divide}, score = 0.0050000000000000044

duration_credit_amount_ratio age multiply installment_commitment multiply credit_amount multiply, 
credit_amount duration multiply age multiply 10000 divide existing_credits multiply num_dependents multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. The top performing feature set includes complex categorical crosses combined with numerical interactions. I'm enhancing the categorical cross feature by multiplying it with credit_amount to create interaction terms that capture how credit amount modifies the relationship between categorical variables.

2. The duration_credit_amount_ratio_age_multiply_installment_commitment_multiply feature is already strong, so I'm further enhancing it by multiplying with credit_amount to create a more powerful interaction term that captures the combined effect of payment capacity, time, and credit size.

3. For the credit_amount_duration_multiply_age_multiply_10000_divide_existing_credits_multiply feature, I'm adding multiplication by num_dependents to incorporate the burden of dependents on credit repayment capacity, creating a more comprehensive financial responsibility metric.

These enhancements build upon the most effective existing features by creating additional interaction terms that capture more complex relationships between financial capacity, time factors, and personal circumstances.
