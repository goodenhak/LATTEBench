2025-09-01 00:02:45,461 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three engineered features in RPN form:

{credit_amount duration divide, credit_amount duration divide installment_commitment divide, purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean}

Reasoning:
1. “credit_amount duration divide”  
   – Monthly installment amount. Captures the straight‐line payment per month rather than the total loan, which often correlates more directly with default risk.

2. “credit_amount duration divide installment_commitment divide”  
   – Approximate monthly payment normalized by the reported installment rate (percentage of income), giving an implicit proxy for borrower income (i.e. how large a loan installment really is relative to their budget).

3. “purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean”  
   – The average loan amount for each purpose category. Enables the model to leverage typical loan sizes by purpose (e.g. business vs. education), which often have different risk profiles.
