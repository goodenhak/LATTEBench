You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

Possible next three steps:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:

Operators:

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>

4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
