You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:

First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Accepted solutions so far:

###'<credit_history_encoded><label_encode><credit_history><Label encoded credit history to numerical values>
<financial_status><concat><checking_status><savings_status><Combined categorical feature of checking and savings status>
<mean_credit_by_job><groupbythenmean><job><credit_amount><Mean credit amount grouped by job type>'###

Here are evaluated solutions that were rejected:
###['<log_credit_amount><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to reduce skewness>\n<credit_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio of credit amount to duration, indicating monthly payment burden>\n<mean_credit_by_history><groupbythenmean><credit_history><credit_amount><Mean credit amount grouped by credit history category>', '<credit_history_encoded><target_encoding><credit_history><Target encoding for credit history based on mean of target>\n<monthly_payment><divide><credit_amount><duration><Approximate monthly payment amount from credit>\n<avg_credit_by_savings><groupbythenmean><savings_status><credit_amount><Average credit amount grouped by savings status>']###,
complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
