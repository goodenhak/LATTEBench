3. <log_credit_amount><log><credit_amount><Log-transformed credit amount to handle skewness>

Reasoning:  
1. monthly_burden captures the monthly repayment pressure, which is more indicative of risk than raw credit amount or duration alone.  
2. age_employment_ratio combines stability indicators (age and employment duration) into a single feature; employment is first label-encoded to convert it to numerical.  
3. log_credit_amount addresses the right-skewed distribution of credit amounts, helping linear models better capture its relationship with the target.  

*Note: For age_employment_ratio, employment (categorical) must be label-encoded first to enable division. This is implied in the operation.*
