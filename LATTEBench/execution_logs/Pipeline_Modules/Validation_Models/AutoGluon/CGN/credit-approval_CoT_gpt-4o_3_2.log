2025-08-22 16:30:14,900 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations, aiming to improve model performance:

1. Feature: Previous Employment Success
   - Idea: Create a feature that captures whether individuals with prior defaults who are employed have a higher likelihood of being accepted for a credit card. This interaction may highlight the mitigating effect of current employment on previous defaults.
   - 
     <previous_employment_success><multiply><PriorDefault><Employed><Interaction_between_prior_default_and_current_employment_status>
     

2. Feature: Financial Stability Index
   - Idea: People with lower debt relative to their income might have better financial stability. By creating a financial stability index that accounts for debt relative to income, we can better assess this aspect.
   - 
     <financial_stability_index><divide><Income><Debt><Ratio_of_income_to_debt_as_means_of_financial_stability>
     

3. Feature: Employment Probability by Industry and Citizenship
   - Idea: Use target encoding to create an aggregate feature that represents the average credit card application success rate within each combination of industry and citizenship. This may highlight industry and citizenship combinations that are more successful.

2025-08-22 16:31:33,149 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtIncomeRatio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio_of_debt_to_income_to_evaluate_financial_liability_relative_to_income>  
   Reasoning: This feature helps in understanding financial burden by considering debt against income, which is a crucial factor in creditworthiness.

2. <NormalizedCreditScore><zscore><CreditScore><Z_score_of_credit_score_to_standardize_and_identify_outliers>  
   Reasoning: Standardizing the credit score helps in neutralizing the scale effect, making it easier to identify anomalies in credit behavior. 

3. <EmploymentStability><multiply><YearsEmployed><Employed><Measure_of_employment_stability_to_estimate_job_consistency_and_credit_risk>  
   Reasoning: Multiplying years employed by employment status gives a sense of job stability, which is pertinent in assessing the applicant's reliability and future financial capability.
