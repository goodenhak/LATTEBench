Reasoning behind steps:
- Step 1: The feature nHM (number of heavy atoms) is highly skewed with many zero values (Q1=0, Median=0). Applying a square root transformation helps to reduce skewness and make the distribution more normal, which can improve the performance of linear models and reduce the influence of outliers.
- Step 2: Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are often involved in biochemical reactions related to biodegradation. Multiplying their counts (nO and nN) creates an interaction feature that may capture synergistic effects or compound properties that individual features miss, potentially enhancing predictive power.
- Step 3: Grouping by nHM (number of heavy atoms) and computing the mean of nO (number of oxygen atoms) within each group provides a new feature that encodes the average oxygen content relative to molecular size. This can highlight trends where biodegradability might depend on the proportion of oxygen atoms in molecules of similar size.

3. \<carbon_oxygen_product\>\<multiply\>\<C%\>\<nO\>\<Interaction between carbon percentage and oxygen count, possibly indicating oxidizable carbon content\>

Reasoning:
1. The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms (O_to_N_ratio) could capture important biochemical relationships since both elements are crucial in biodegradation pathways. Many biodegradation processes involve oxidation (oxygen) and nitrogen-containing functional groups often affect degradation rates.

2. Creating a binary feature for halogen presence (has_halogen) from nX is valuable because halogenated compounds are generally more resistant to biodegradation. The original nX feature has many zeros (Q3=0) so binarizing helps capture this important chemical property more effectively.

3. Multiplying carbon percentage (C%) with oxygen count (nO) creates an interaction term that might represent the oxidizable carbon potential. Compounds with high carbon but low oxygen might be less biodegradable, while those with both high carbon and high oxygen could be more degradable. This interaction could help the model capture nonlinear relationships.

2025-08-22 14:29:10,910 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <has_halogen><bin><nX><Binary indicator for presence of any halogen atoms (nX > 0)>
   Reasoning: nX has 75% zeros (Q3=0), making it highly sparse. A binary flag captures the meaningful distinction between having/not having halogens, which are known to hinder biodegradation.

2. <O_to_C_ratio><ratio><nO><C%><Ratio of oxygen atoms to carbon percentage, potentially indicating oxidation state>
   Reasoning: Both oxygen content and carbon percentage are chemically relevant for biodegradability. Their ratio may capture oxidation balance better than either feature alone.

3. <N_O_sum><plus><nN><nO><Sum of nitrogen and oxygen atoms, representing total potential hydrogen bond acceptors>
   Reasoning: nHDon already counts H-bond donors, but the sum of N and O atoms (common H-bond acceptors) could provide complementary information about molecular polarity relevant to biodegradation.
