2025-08-22 17:06:27,995 - INFO - LLM Output: Below are three proposed feature‐engineering steps along with the reasoning behind each:

1. Capture potential interaction effects between a customer’s industry and ethnicity, as different ethnic groups may perform differently in distinct sectors.  
2. Create a stability metric by relating years employed to age—people with longer employment histories relative to their age may be seen as more credit‐worthy.  
3. Leverage group statistics on credit score by citizenship status to expose systemic creditworthiness differences across citizenship types.
