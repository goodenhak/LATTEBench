2. <credit_duration_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Ratio of credit amount to loan duration>
3. <purpose_mean_age><groupbythenmean><purpose><age><Mean age by loan purpose>

Reasoning:  
1. Grouping by employment status and averaging credit amounts captures income stability patterns, as stable employment likely correlates with higher credit approvals.  
2. The credit-to-duration ratio acts as a proxy for monthly repayment burden, a key factor in credit decisions.  
3. Age varies significantly by loan purpose (e.g., education for younger applicants), and grouping captures these demographic trends that affect risk assessment.  

These features leverage financial behavior patterns (1-2) and demographic correlations (3) likely to improve predictive power beyond raw features.

3. <target_enc_credit_history_purpose><groupbythenmean><credit_history><purpose><target_encoding><Target encoding using combined credit history and purpose groups>

Reasoning:
1. Combining employment duration and residence duration creates a stability indicator that might be more predictive than either feature alone, as longer stability often correlates with better creditworthiness.
2. Multiplying the monthly credit burden ratio by installment commitment creates a more comprehensive debt burden index that accounts for both the absolute monthly payment and its proportion to disposable income.
3. Creating a target encoding that groups by both credit history and purpose captures more specific patterns than single-feature encodings, potentially revealing nuanced interactions between credit history and loan purpose.

3. <checking_savings_cross><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings status to capture combined financial stability patterns>

Reasoning:
1. The absolute deviation captures how extreme the loan amount is relative to others with similar credit history, which may indicate higher risk regardless of whether the deviation is positive or negative.

2. Younger applicants with longer loan durations may represent higher risk, while older applicants with shorter durations may be safer. This ratio captures this interaction effect.

3. Combining checking and savings status through crossing creates a composite financial stability feature that may better predict creditworthiness than either feature alone, as they represent different aspects of financial health.
