2025-08-22 04:37:35,609 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate additional features that could improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<savings_job_cross\>\<cross\>\<savings_status\>\<job\>\<combined\_savings\_and\_job\_status\_to\_identify\_interactions\_in\_employment\_and\_financial\_stability\>  
   Reasoning: By combining savings status and job type, this feature can help capture interactions between financial savings and employment stability, which may provide insights into the applicant's creditworthiness.

2. \<age_installment_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<age\>\<installment_commitment\>\<age\_to\_installment\_rate\_to\_assess\_financial\_burden\>  
   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of age to installment rate could help assess the financial burden relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially indicating the ability to manage long-term financial commitments.

3. \<foreign_worker_label\>\<label_encode\>\<foreign_worker\>\<numerical\_representation\_of\_foreign\_worker\_status\>  
   Reasoning: Using label encoding on the foreign worker status to convert it into a numerical feature may help the model more effectively utilize this categorical information in predicting credit approval outcomes.

2025-08-22 04:46:10,345 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. \<credit_amount_duration_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<credit_amount\>\<duration\>\<credit_amount_duration_interaction\_to\_capture\_financial\_obligation\_impact\>
   - This feature captures the interaction between the credit amount and the duration, which may indicate the total financial obligation of the borrower. A higher value may imply a greater financial commitment, potentially affecting creditworthiness.

2. \<employment_checking_status_cross\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<checking_status\>\<combined\_employment\_and\_checking\_account\_status\_to\_identify\_financial\_stability\>
   - This feature combines the employment status with the checking account status. It aims to capture the financial stability of the individual by considering both their employment status and the current state of their checking account.

3. \<delinquency_risk_score\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<num_dependents\>\<credit_amount\_to\_num\_dependents\_ratio\_to\_assess\_delinquency\_risk\>
   - This feature assesses the risk of delinquency by computing the ratio of the credit amount to the number of dependents. A higher ratio could indicate a greater risk if the debtor has a larger loan relative to the number of dependents, potentially stressing their financial resources.
