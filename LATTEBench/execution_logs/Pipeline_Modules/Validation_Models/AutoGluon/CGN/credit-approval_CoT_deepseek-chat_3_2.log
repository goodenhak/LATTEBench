2025-08-22 15:36:51,088 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<DebtToIncomeRatio\>\<divide\>\<Debt\>\<Income\>\<Ratio of debt to income, which may indicate financial stress and affect credit card approval\>
   Reasoning: This creates a financial leverage indicator. High debt relative to income often leads to credit application rejections. Since both features are numerical, division is appropriate.

2. \<EmployedWithBankAccount\>\<cross\>\<Employed\>\<BankCustomer\>\<Interaction between employment status and having a bank account, both positive indicators for creditworthiness\>
   Reasoning: Cross creates all combinations of these binary features. Being both employed and having a bank account should significantly increase approval chances compared to having just one or neither.

3. \<YearsEmployedBinned\>\<bin\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Discretizes years employed into bins to capture non-linear relationships with credit approval\>
   Reasoning: Binning continuous variables like YearsEmployed can help machine learning models capture threshold effects where certain employment duration ranges have different impacts on approval decisions.

   Reasoning: This creates a financial health indicator. High debt relative to income could negatively impact approval chances, while low ratios might be favorable. Since both features are numerical, division is appropriate.

2. \<Employed_YearsEmployed_Interaction\>\<multiply\>\<Employed\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Interaction between employment status and years employed, capturing both current employment and experience\>
   Reasoning: This combines employment status with experience level. Being employed with many years of experience should be highly favorable for credit approval, while being unemployed makes years irrelevant (0).

3. \<CreditScore_Age_Interaction\>\<multiply\>\<CreditScore\>\<Age\>\<Interaction between credit score and age, as older individuals with good credit may be more favorable\>
   Reasoning: Age and credit score are both important factors. Older applicants typically have more established credit histories, so combining these may better capture creditworthiness than either alone.

   Reasoning: This creates a normalized measure of work experience. A higher ratio suggests the person started working earlier or has been consistently employed, which is a positive signal for creditworthiness.

2. \<Debt_to_Income_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<Debt\>\<Income\>\<Debt burden relative to income, a key financial health indicator\>
   Reasoning: This is a fundamental metric in credit scoring. A high ratio indicates over-leverage and a higher risk of default, making it a powerful predictive feature.

3. \<CreditScore_Employed_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<CreditScore\>\<Employed\>\<Interaction between credit score and employment status\>
   Reasoning: This feature captures the synergistic effect of having a good credit score AND being employed. The product will be non-zero only for employed individuals with a credit history, a strong positive signal.
