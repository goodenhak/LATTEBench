Task: The aim of this dataset is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle (OPEL, SAAB, BUS, VAN), using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

3. <kurtosis_diff><subtract><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR><KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR><Difference between major and minor axis kurtosis, measuring distribution asymmetry>

Reasoning:
1. The ratio between COMPACTNESS and CIRCULARITY could reveal how different vehicles balance perimeter-based vs radius-based circularity measures, potentially improving separation between rounded vehicles (like buses) and more angular ones (like vans).

2. Multiplying the scaled variances creates a combined measure of spread that might better distinguish vehicles with consistent variance patterns (e.g., symmetrical cars) from those with irregular silhouettes (e.g., vans with protruding features).

3. The kurtosis difference captures asymmetry in the distribution of silhouette points, which could help differentiate between vehicles with uniform contours (low difference) versus those with irregular features (high difference), particularly useful for distinguishing complex vehicle shapes like buses from simpler car profiles.

3. <log_scaled_variance_minor><log><SCALED_VARIANCE_MINOR><Logarithm of minor scaled variance to handle its high variance and skewness>

Reasoning:
1. The ratio of scaled variances complements the existing product feature by showing dominance relationships between major/minor axis spread, which could distinguish elongated vehicles (buses) from compact ones.
2. Multiplying elongation with aspect ratio creates a compound shape descriptor that captures both overall stretch and axis proportionality, potentially improving separation between vans and sedans.
3. Applying log transform to SCALED_VARIANCE_MINOR (which has high std=178) normalizes its distribution, making patterns more detectable for linear models while maintaining relative relationships.

Reasoning:
1. The kurtosis ratio could reveal distinctive tail behavior patterns between vehicle types (e.g., buses might have different distribution characteristics than compact cars)
2. Normalizing compactness will make it more comparable with other features and potentially improve linear model performance
3. Multiplying elongation with aspect ratio creates a combined feature that might better capture overall vehicle shape characteristics than either feature alone

Note: These features complement the existing engineered features while focusing on different aspects of the data (distribution characteristics, normalization, and feature interaction).

Reasoning:
1. The sine transformation of PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO could help capture periodic relationships in the angular viewing perspectives of vehicles, which might reveal patterns not captured by the raw aspect ratio values.

2. Taking the absolute value of kurtosis_diff removes the directionality while preserving the magnitude of distribution asymmetry, which could be more relevant for vehicle classification than the signed difference.

3. Creating a ratio between ELONGATEDNESS and MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO combines two different elongation measures that might interact in meaningful ways for distinguishing vehicle types, particularly between elongated vehicles like buses and more compact vehicles.
