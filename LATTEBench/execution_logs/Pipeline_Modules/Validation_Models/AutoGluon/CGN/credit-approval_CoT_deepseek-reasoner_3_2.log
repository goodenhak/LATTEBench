2025-08-22 17:31:52,964 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtToIncomeRatio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio of debt to income, important for credit assessment>
2. <YearsEmployedLog><log><YearsEmployed><Log transform of years employed to handle skewness>
3. <IndustryTargetEnc><target_encoding><Industry><Target encoded industry based on approval rates>

Reasoning:
1. Debt-to-Income ratio is a fundamental metric in credit scoring - lenders use this to assess repayment capacity
2. YearsEmployed is highly right-skewed (mean=2.016 vs median=0.9175) - log transform normalizes distribution
3. Industry has 14 categories - target encoding captures industry-specific approval patterns more efficiently than one-hot encoding

1. <AgeZScore><zscore><Age><Standardized age values to handle scale differences>
2. <EmployedIndustryCross><cross><Employed><Industry><Interaction between employment status and industry sector>
3. <ZipCodeIncomeMean><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Income><Average income by zip code as socioeconomic indicator>

Reasoning:
1. Age ranges widely (13.75-74.83) - standardization helps models compare with other features
2. Employment effect likely varies across industries - cross feature captures this interaction
3. ZipCode shows geographic patterns - grouping by zip code reveals area-based income characteristics

1. <CreditScoreSqrt><sqrt><CreditScore><Square root transform for highly skewed credit scores>
2. <EthnicityTargetEnc><target_encoding><Ethnicity><Ethnicity-based approval rate encoding>
3. <DebtIncomeProduct><multiply><Debt><Income><Multiplicative interaction between debt and income>

Reasoning:
1. CreditScore is extremely right-skewed (Q3=2.75 vs max=67) - sqrt transform reduces skewness
2. Ethnicity has 5 categories - target encoding preserves information while reducing dimensionality
3. Debt and income likely have multiplicative rather than additive effects on approval decisions

3. <Industry_target_encoded><target_encoding><Industry><target_encoded_industry_based_on_approval_rates>

Reasoning:
1. Income is highly skewed (mean=1135.93 vs median=5.0) - log transformation helps normalize the distribution and improves model performance with skewed financial data
2. Combining employment status with years employed creates an interaction feature that better captures employment stability than either feature alone
3. Target encoding Industry captures sector-specific approval patterns while avoiding high dimensionality from one-hot encoding (14 categories)

3. <DebtToIncome><ratio><Debt><Income><Debt-to-income ratio, a key financial health indicator for credit decisions>

Reasoning:
1. Income shows extreme skewness (mean=1135.93 vs median=5.0), so log transformation helps normalize its distribution and reduce the impact of outliers while preserving the ordinal nature of income levels.

2. The ratio between YearsEmployed and Age provides a normalized measure of work experience relative to life stage. This could capture whether someone has stable employment history compared to their age group.

3. Debt-to-income ratio is a fundamental metric in credit scoring. While both features are scaled separately, their ratio creates a meaningful financial indicator that directly relates to repayment capacity.

3. <LogYearsEmployed><log><YearsEmployed><Log-transformed years employed to handle skew>

Reasoning:
1. Debt-to-Income ratio is a crucial financial metric in credit decisions that combines two important financial features
2. Target encoding Industry captures industry-specific approval patterns while avoiding high dimensionality of one-hot encoding
3. YearsEmployed is highly right-skewed (mean=2.02, Q3=2.5 but max=28.5) - log transform normalizes the distribution and improves linear model performance
