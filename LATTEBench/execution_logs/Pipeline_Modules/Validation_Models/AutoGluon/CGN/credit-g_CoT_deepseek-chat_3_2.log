3. <age_group><bin><age><5><Binned age into 5 groups to capture non-linear effects on credit risk.>

Reasoning:
1. The ratio of credit_amount to duration represents the monthly repayment amount, which is a strong indicator of affordability and default risk. Higher ratios may indicate higher financial strain.
2. Cross between checking_status and savings_status creates a combined feature that captures the interaction between short-term (checking) and medium-term (savings) financial health, which could be more predictive than either feature alone.
3. Age often has non-linear relationships with credit risk. Binning into 5 groups allows the model to capture different risk patterns across age segments without assuming linearity.

2025-08-22 03:40:04,227 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <checking_status_encoded><label_encode><checking_status><Encoded checking_status (numerical) from categorical>
Reasoning: Converting categorical 'checking_status' to numerical via label encoding allows linear models to utilize this important financial stability indicator directly. The status of checking account is likely highly predictive of creditworthiness.

2. <credit_amount_duration_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Ratio of credit amount to loan duration (monthly burden)>
Reasoning: This creates a feature representing the approximate monthly payment burden, which is a strong indicator of repayment capacity. Higher ratios may indicate higher risk.

3. <age_group><bin><age><Binned age into groups (e.g., young, middle-aged, senior) for non-linear patterns>
Reasoning: Age often has non-linear relationships with credit risk. Binning allows models to capture different risk patterns across age groups rather than assuming linear relationships.

3. <savings_to_credit_ratio><ratio><savings_status><credit_amount><Relative savings strength compared to credit amount, indicating financial buffer for repayment>

Reasoning:
1. The credit_amount_per_installment already shows the monthly burden, but dividing by installment_commitment (percentage of income) creates a ratio that measures the overall debt burden relative to income, which is a strong predictor of creditworthiness.

2. Crossing employment status with age group creates interaction terms that capture how employment stability at different life stages affects credit risk (e.g., unstable employment in middle age vs young age).

3. Creating a ratio between savings_status (encoded as numerical) and credit_amount measures the relative strength of savings compared to the loan amount, indicating the applicant's financial buffer and ability to handle repayment challenges.

3. <employment_stability_index><groupbythenmean><employment><duration><Average loan duration by employment category, indicating employment stability risk profile>

Reasoning:
1. Credit amount per dependent captures the actual financial burden relative to family responsibilities, which is a strong indicator of repayment capacity. This ratio feature helps identify cases where large loans are taken by individuals with many dependents, increasing default risk.

2. The cross between checking and savings status creates a comprehensive liquidity profile feature. Different combinations (e.g., no checking + no savings vs. high checking + high savings) have dramatically different risk implications that aren't captured by treating these features separately.

3. Employment stability index uses groupbythenmean to calculate average loan duration by employment category, revealing patterns where certain employment groups tend to take longer/shorter loans. This captures the interaction between employment stability and loan term preferences, which is predictive of credit risk.

3. <age_credit_history_interaction><cross><age_group><credit_history><Combined effect of age group and credit history on credit risk, capturing life stage financial responsibility patterns.>

Reasoning:
1. The credit_amount_to_savings_ratio creates a measure of loan burden relative to savings capacity, which is a strong indicator of financial stability. Those with higher credit amounts relative to their savings are likely higher risk.

2. The employment_duration_affordability interaction combines employment stability with the monthly payment burden, capturing the dual risk of unstable income combined with high monthly obligations, which is a critical risk factor.

3. The age_credit_history_interaction captures how creditworthiness assessment differs across life stages. Younger applicants with poor credit history may be riskier than older applicants with the same history, and vice versa, due to different financial maturity levels.

3. <age_credit_amount_interaction><multiply><age><credit_amount><Product of age and credit amount to capture combined effect of life stage and loan size on credit risk>

Reasoning:
1. The credit_amount_to_savings_ratio would provide insight into how the loan amount compares to the applicant's savings capacity. Those with higher credit amounts relative to their savings (encoded numerically) would be riskier, as they have less financial buffer.

2. While employment_duration_interaction exists, a direct cross between duration and employment would capture more nuanced risk patterns. Long durations with unstable employment (unemployed or <1 year) would indicate higher default risk compared to stable employment with shorter durations.

3. Multiplying age and credit amount creates an interaction term that captures how loan size risk varies across different life stages. Older applicants with large loans might be riskier due to retirement considerations, while younger applicants with large loans might indicate overextension.
