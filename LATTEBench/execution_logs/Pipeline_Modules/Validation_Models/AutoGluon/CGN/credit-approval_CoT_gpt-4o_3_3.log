2025-08-22 16:36:34,849 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <EmployedDebtRatio><ratio><Debt><Employed><ratio_of_outstanding_debt_to_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures how much debt an employed person is carrying relative to their employment status. High debt levels relative to being employed could indicate financial stress, which is critical in determining credit suitability.

2. <AgeIncomeInteraction><multiply><Age><Income><interaction_of_age_and_income>
   - Reasoning: This interaction feature explores the relationship between a person's age and their income. Older individuals with higher incomes may have a better ability to repay debts and thus a higher likelihood of credit approval.

3. <EthnicityIndustryCross><cross><Ethnicity><Industry><cross_of_ethnicity_and_industry>
   - Reasoning: Different ethnic groups may have varying experiences and opportunities in different industries, potentially affecting credit approval odds. This cross-feature captures those unique interactions that might be influential in predicting credit card application success.

2025-08-22 16:42:27,148 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features, aimed at improving the prediction of credit card application success:

1. <age_prior_default_ratio><divide><Age><PriorDefault><This_feature_calculates_the_ratio_of_a_person's_age_to_whether_they_have_a_prior_default_shown_as_binary_value>
   - Reasoning: By examining the ratio between age and prior defaults, we might identify how an individual's stage in life (age) correlates with previous credit-related behavior, which could influence creditworthiness.

2. <income_debt_ratio><divide><Income><Debt><Calculates_the_ratio_of_income_to_debt_which_can_help_understand_the_user's_ability_to_cover_their_debts_with_their_income>
   - Reasoning: This feature could highlight financial stability by indicating the proportion of income used against outstanding debt, potentially revealing financial health and risk levels.

3. <employed_citizen_cross><cross><Employed><Citizen><Combines_employment_status_with_citizenship_status_to_identify_any_trends_in_employment_among_different_citizenship_groups>
   - Reasoning: Crossing employment status with citizenship status may uncover hidden patterns in credit card applications, as different citizenship statuses might affect employment opportunities and thus credit card eligibility.

   - This feature aims to capture the interaction between the number of years employed and the credit score. A long-term stable employment often reflects financial stability, and when combined with a credit score, it might provide an insight into the applicant's likelihood of credit card application success.

2. \<marital_income_interaction\>cross\<Married\>\<Income\>\<interaction_between_marital_status_and_income\>  
   - By creating an interaction between marital status and income, we can capture potential differences in financial behavior and obligations. Married individuals might have different financial responsibilities than single individuals, which could affect their credit card application success.

3. \<citizen_employment_contrast\>cross\<Citizen\>\<Employed\>\<interaction_of_citizenship_and_employment_status\>  
   - This feature explores the relationship between an individual's employment status and their citizenship status. Certain citizenship types might necessitate different job opportunities or stability, influencing the likelihood of success in credit card applications.
