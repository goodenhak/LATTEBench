2025-08-21 19:25:28,324 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<DebtToIncomeRatio\>\<divide\>\<Debt\>\<Income\>\<Ratio of debt to income, which may indicate financial stress and affect credit card approval\>
   Reasoning: Debt and Income are both numerical features. Creating a ratio (Debt/Income) can capture the relative burden of debt compared to income, which is a critical factor in creditworthiness assessments. This feature might be more predictive than using Debt or Income alone.

2. \<CreditScoreScaled\>\<zscore\>\<CreditScore\>\<Standardized credit score to handle its skewed distribution and improve model performance\>
   Reasoning: CreditScore has a highly skewed distribution (Q1=0, Median=0, Q3=3, Mean=2.46). Applying z-score standardization (mean=0, std=1) can help normalize this feature, making it easier for models to learn from it, especially linear models and distance-based algorithms.

3. \<EmployedYearsEmployedInteraction\>\<multiply\>\<Employed\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Interaction between employment status and years employed, capturing combined effect on stability\>
   Reasoning: Employed (binary) and YearsEmployed (numerical) are both related to employment stability. Multiplying them creates a feature that is 0 for unemployed individuals and equal to YearsEmployed for employed ones. This interaction might better represent the combined effect of employment status and duration on creditworthiness.

3. \<Ethnicity_Industry_cross\>\<cross\>\<Ethnicity\>\<Industry\>\<Interaction between Ethnicity and Industry to capture intersectional effects on approval rates\>

Reasoning:
1. Age_squared: Age often has non-linear relationships with financial behavior. Squaring Age can help capture potential quadratic effects where middle-aged applicants might be more creditworthy than both younger and older extremes.

2. ZipCode_rank: ZipCode shows high variability (Std=188.8) with potential outliers. Ranking transforms it into a uniform distribution while preserving ordinal information, making it more robust for modeling and handling non-linear patterns.

3. Ethnicity_Industry_cross: Both categorical variables might have interaction effects (e.g., certain ethnic groups in specific industries may have different approval rates). Cross product creates combined categories to capture these intersectional relationships that individual features might miss.
