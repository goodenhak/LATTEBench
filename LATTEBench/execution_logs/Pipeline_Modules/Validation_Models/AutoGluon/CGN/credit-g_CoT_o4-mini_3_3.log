Reasoning:  
- The installment_to_mean ratio highlights applicants whose installment burden deviates from purpose-specific norms.  
- Aggregating mean credit_amount by credit_history captures typical loan sizes for each history profile, revealing risk-related patterns.  
- Crossing personal_status with employment uncovers joint segments (e.g., unmarried short-tenure employees) that may exhibit distinct credit behaviors.
