3. <Me_Mi_diff><subtract><Me><Mi><Difference in mean electronegativity and ionization potential, reflecting electronic properties>

Reasoning:  
1. The ratio of oxygen atoms to hydrogen bond donors (nO/nHDon) may capture molecular polarity patterns relevant to biodegradation pathways. Since both features have zeros, we use ratio operator which handles division safely by returning NaN when denominator is zero (to be imputed later).

2. Multiplying carbon percentage (C%) with terminal primary carbons (nCp) creates an interaction term that could identify compounds with both high carbon content and reactive terminal groups - potentially important for enzymatic breakdown.

3. The difference between Sanderson electronegativity (Me) and ionization potential (Mi) may reveal electronic characteristics affecting molecular stability and biodegradability. These features are highly correlated (r≈0.89 based on their means/stds) so their difference could extract unique signal.

These operations avoid categorical features (all inputs are numerical), create chemically meaningful interactions, and leverage domain knowledge about molecular properties affecting biodegradation.

   - Reasoning: Halogen atoms often reduce biodegradability. Binning converts the count into a categorical presence/absence indicator, which may better capture this nonlinear relationship.

2. <nO_x_nN><multiply><nO><nN><Product of oxygen and nitrogen counts>
   - Reasoning: Synergistic effects between oxygen and nitrogen atoms (e.g., in nitro groups or amines) could impact biodegradability. Multiplication captures interaction effects.

3. <mean_nO_by_halogen><groupbythenmean><nX_bin><nO><Mean oxygen count grouped by halogen presence>
   - Reasoning: Halogen-containing compounds may have different oxidative characteristics. This groups compounds by halogen presence and summarizes typical oxygen content, potentially revealing subgroup patterns.
