3. <personal_status_other_parties_cross><cross><personal_status><other_parties><Interaction between personal status and other parties involvement>

Reasoning:
1. The ratio of credit_amount to duration creates a meaningful financial metric (approximate monthly payment) that directly relates to repayment capacity
2. Converting employment to numerical via label encoding then multiplying with age captures non-linear relationships between work experience and life stage
3. Crossing two categorical features (personal_status and other_parties) may reveal important interaction effects (e.g., single applicants with co-applicants vs married applicants with guarantors)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

2025-08-22 07:26:22,485 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_credit_amount><log><credit_amount><Log transformation of credit amount to handle skewness>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has high variance (Std=2769.8) and positive skew (Mean>Median). Log transformation helps normalize such distributions, potentially improving linear model performance.

2. <monthly_burden><divide><credit_amount><duration><Monthly payment burden: credit amount divided by loan duration>
   Reasoning: Creates a ratio feature representing approximate monthly payment obligation. This synthesizes two key financial characteristics that likely interact in credit decisions.

3. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings account statuses>
   Reasoning: Combines two financial stability indicators. The interaction may reveal patterns not captured by individual features (e.g., poor checking but good savings status might indicate temporary liquidity issues).
