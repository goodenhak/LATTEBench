2025-08-21 17:01:33,992 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nHDon_plus_nX><plus><nHDon><nX><Sum of hydrogen bond donors and halogen atoms, which may indicate competing effects on biodegradability>
   Reasoning: Hydrogen bond donors (nHDon) can enhance biodegradation through hydrogen bonding, while halogens (nX) often hinder biodegradation. Their sum might capture a balance or interaction between these opposing factors.

2. <C_percent_times_nO><multiply><C%><nO><Interaction between carbon percentage and oxygen count, as higher carbon with oxygen might indicate more oxidizable groups>
   Reasoning: Carbon percentage (C%) and oxygen atoms (nO) are both important for biodegradation. Their product could highlight compounds with high carbon content that also have oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., alcohols, carboxylic acids) that are prone to microbial attack.

3. <SdO_to_nHDon_ratio><divide><SdO><nHDon><Average E-state value per hydrogen bond donor, indicating donor strength and reactivity>
   Reasoning: The total E-state value for oxygen (SdO) relates to oxygen reactivity, and nHDon counts potential hydrogen bond donors. The ratio might quantify the average strength or reactivity of each donor atom, which could influence biodegradation pathways.

3. <C_percent_times_nO><multiply><C%><nO><Interaction between carbon percentage and oxygen count, potentially indicating oxidation state>

Reasoning:
1. Squaring nO_plus_nN (which already showed good predictive power in the examples) can capture nonlinear relationships where the effect of hydrogen bonding potential on biodegradability accelerates with more donor atoms.
2. This creates a more refined hydrogen bonding metric by normalizing the oxygen E-state sum by the total number of potential donor atoms, potentially better indicating the average donor strength.
3. The interaction between carbon percentage and oxygen count could reveal compounds where high carbon content combines with oxygen functionality (potential for oxidation), which is relevant for biodegradation pathways.
