1. Capturing group‐level creditworthiness differences by ethnicity may reveal systemic patterns not seen at the individual level.  
2. A direct income‐to‐debt ratio highlights repayment capacity more intuitively than debt‐to‐income (especially when debt is low).  
3. Binning the highly skewed DebtIncomeRatio into categorical risk buckets can help tree‐based or interaction models better segment applicants.

2025-08-22 17:20:02,832 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three feature‐engineering ideas aimed at capturing skew, area‐level risk, and industry‐level risk:

1. DebtIncomeRatio is extremely skewed—log‐transforming it will stabilize variance and help models learn from small vs. huge leverage levels.  
2. Default behavior varies by geography—computing the historical default rate per ZipCode provides an area‐risk signal.  
3. Industries differ in inherent default risk—target‐encoding Industry by PriorDefault injects that sector‐level default propensity.
