3. <checking_status_encoded><label_encode><checking_status><Encoded checking status for better model interpretation>

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount_per_month: This creates a more meaningful financial metric than credit_amount alone, representing the actual monthly payment burden which is crucial for assessing repayment capacity.
2. age_squared: Age often has a U-shaped relationship with credit risk (both very young and very old applicants may be higher risk), and squaring helps capture this non-linearity.
3. checking_status_encoded: Converting the categorical checking_status to numerical values allows linear models to better utilize this important financial stability indicator while maintaining the ordinal nature of the categories.

3. <checking_savings_cross><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Cross feature between checking and savings account status>

Reasoning:
1. credit_to_income_ratio: This creates a debt-to-income ratio proxy, which is a fundamental metric in credit scoring. A higher ratio indicates higher repayment burden, making default more likely.

2. age_duration_interaction: Older applicants with longer loan durations may represent different risk profiles than younger applicants with short durations. This interaction captures non-linear relationships between these important demographic and loan characteristics.

3. checking_savings_cross: The combination of checking and savings account status can reveal more nuanced financial stability patterns than either feature alone (e.g., someone with good checking but no savings vs. someone with both).
