   Reasoning: Hydrogen bonding is crucial for biodegradability as it affects solubility and interaction with enzymes. Combining nHDon (donor atoms) and nO (oxygen atoms, which can be acceptors) may better represent the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds.

2. \<C_percent_times_nCb_minus\>\<multiply\>\<C%\>\<nCb-\>\<Interaction between carbon percentage and substituted benzene rings, which may indicate aromaticity and carbon content\>
   Reasoning: Aromatic compounds (like substituted benzenes) are often less biodegradable. Multiplying the percentage of carbon by the number of substituted benzene rings could highlight compounds with high aromatic carbon content.

3. \<SdO_ratio_nO\>\<ratio\>\<SdO\>\<nO\>\<Average E-state value per oxygen atom, indicating the electronic environment of oxygens\>
   Reasoning: The E-state (SdO) describes the electron accessibility of oxygen atoms. Normalizing by the number of oxygen atoms (nO) gives an average per atom, which might distinguish reactive vs. inert oxygens (e.g., in esters vs. alcohols).

3. <SdO_ratio_nO_log><log><SdO_ratio_nO><Log transform of oxygen electronic environment to handle extreme values and improve linearity>

Reasoning:
1. The square root transform on nHDon_plus_nO will help normalize its distribution (which appears right-skewed based on Q3=4.0 and mean=2.7) while preserving the hierarchical nature of hydrogen bonding capacity. This can help linear models better capture this relationship.

2. Creating a ratio between C_percent_times_nCb_minus (aromatic carbon content indicator) and nHM (number of heavy atoms) normalizes the aromaticity measure by molecular size. This could better distinguish between molecules with high aromatic content relative to their size versus large molecules with minimal aromatic character.

3. Applying a log transform to SdO_ratio_nO (which has high variance with std=3.92) will help handle the extreme values and make the distribution more normal, allowing models to better utilize this electronic environment information without being dominated by outliers.

Reasoning:
1. The ratio between SpMax_B(m) and SpMax_L creates a normalized measure comparing different matrix representations, potentially capturing unique molecular structural information that individual features might miss.
2. nHDon_plus_nO shows high skewness (many zeros, Q1=1, Q3=4) - sqrt transformation helps normalize the distribution while preserving the zero values important for indicating absence of hydrogen bonding capacity.
3. C_percent_times_nCb_minus has extreme range [0,654] with high standard deviation (102.2) - log transform helps compress the scale and handle the heavy right tail while maintaining the interaction's meaningful relationship.

3. <C_percent_times_nCb_minus_zscore><zscore><C_percent_times_nCb_minus><Standardized interaction term between carbon percentage and substituted benzene rings>

Reasoning:
1. The ratio between SpMax_B(m) and SpMax_L creates a normalized measure comparing two different matrix representations (Burden vs Laplace), which may capture important structural differences more effectively than either feature alone.
2. Applying square root to nHDon_plus_nO helps normalize this count-based feature that has a right-skewed distribution (many zeros, some high values), making it more suitable for linear models.
3. Standardizing C_percent_times_nCb_minus is valuable because this feature has a very wide range (0-654) and high standard deviation, which could dominate other features in distance-based algorithms. Z-score normalization will make its scale comparable to other features.

Reasoning:
1. The spectral gap between different matrix representations (Burden vs Laplace) may provide additional discriminatory power about molecular structure complexity that the ratio alone doesn't capture.
2. The log transform of hydrogen bonding capacity will better handle the zero-inflated distribution while maintaining the ordinal relationship, potentially improving linear model performance.
3. The square root transform of the interaction term will reduce the extreme right-skew evident from the range (0-654) while preserving the interaction effect, making it more suitable for many ML algorithms.

Reasoning:
1. The ratio between structural eigenvalue (SpMax_B(m)) and electronic property (Mi) could capture how molecular size/structure relates to ionization potential, which may influence biodegradability.
2. Applying sigmoid to nHDon_plus_nO will bound this hydrogen bonding capacity measure between 0-1, making it more suitable for models sensitive to input scale while preserving its monotonic relationship.
3. The C_percent_times_nCb_minus feature has high variance (std=102.2) and extreme values. Log transformation will help normalize its distribution while maintaining the interaction effect between carbon percentage and aromatic substitution.

   Reasoning: Multiplying these two engineered features creates a non-linear interaction term that may help the model capture cases where both spectral characteristics and hydrogen bonding capacity jointly influence biodegradability.

2. <C_percent_times_nCb_minus_sqrt_plus_SdO_ratio_nO><plus><C_percent_times_nCb_minus_sqrt><SdO_ratio_nO><Combined measure of aromatic carbon content and oxygen electronic environment, both relevant for biodegradation pathways>
   Reasoning: Adding these features combines information about aromatic structure (which affects stability) with oxygen electronic environment (which affects reactivity), potentially creating a more comprehensive descriptor of molecular degradability.

3. <SpMax_Bm_SpMax_L_diff_abs><abs><SpMax_Bm_SpMax_L_diff><Absolute value of spectral gap between Burden and Laplace matrices, emphasizing magnitude of spectral difference regardless of direction>
   Reasoning: Taking the absolute value of the spectral difference removes the sign information while preserving the magnitude of the spectral gap, which may be more important for classification than the direction of the difference.

2025-08-22 11:49:33,384 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SpMax_Bm_SpMax_L_ratio_sqrt><sqrt><SpMax_Bm_SpMax_L_ratio><Square root of spectral ratio to further normalize distribution and handle potential non-linearity>
   Reasoning: The ratio of SpMax_B(m) to SpMax_L already captures relative spectral dominance, but taking its square root can help normalize the distribution further, making it more Gaussian-like and potentially improving linear model performance or tree-based model splits.

2. <nHDon_plus_nO_sqrt_times_nHM><multiply><nHDon_plus_nO_sqrt><nHM><Interaction between normalized hydrogen bonding capacity and heavy atom count, capturing molecular size and polarity relationship>
   Reasoning: Hydrogen bonding capacity (nHDon_plus_nO_sqrt) and heavy atom count (nHM) are both important molecular properties. Their interaction might reveal compounds where polarity scales with size, which could be significant for biodegradability prediction.

3. <C_percent_times_nCb_minus_sqrt_rank><rank><C_percent_times_nCb_minus_sqrt><Rank transformation of aromaticity-carbon interaction term to make it robust to outliers and normalize distribution>
   Reasoning: The square root term (C_percent_times_nCb_minus_sqrt) still has a skewed distribution. Applying rank transformation will convert it to a uniform distribution, making it more suitable for various modeling techniques and reducing the influence of extreme values.
