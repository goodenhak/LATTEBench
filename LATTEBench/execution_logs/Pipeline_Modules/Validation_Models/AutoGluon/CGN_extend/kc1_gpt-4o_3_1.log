2025-08-08 00:55:55,341 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. cyclicality_intensity_ratio = divide [complexity_intensity, v(g)]: Calculates the ratio of complexity intensity to cyclomatic complexity, potentially highlighting modules where complexity intensity is high relative to cyclomatic complexity.
2. effort_normalized_intensity = multiply [normalized_complexity_intensity, e]: Combines normalized complexity intensity with effort to provide a scaled measure of effort-adjusted complexity impact.
3. branch_count_intelligence_ratio = ratio [branchCount, intelligence_correlation]: Computes the ratio of branch count to intelligence correlation to assess the balance between code branching and intelligence aspects, possibly identifying modules where branching is intense but intelligence is high.
