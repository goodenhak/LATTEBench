2. Oxygen_Density_log = log [Oxygen_Density]: Applies the logarithmic transformation to the Oxygen Density feature to reduce skewness and better capture nonlinear relationships.

3. C_Me_product = multiply [C%, Me]: Calculates the product of the percentage of C atoms and mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity, examining the joint influence on biodegradability.
