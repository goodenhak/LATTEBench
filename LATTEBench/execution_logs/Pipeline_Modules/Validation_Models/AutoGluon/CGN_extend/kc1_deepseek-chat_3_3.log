2025-08-08 00:10:58,684 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features that could be useful for the KC1 software defect prediction task:

1. complexity_ratio = ratio [v(g), loc]: Measures the ratio of cyclomatic complexity to lines of code, indicating how complex the code is relative to its size.  
2. halstead_effort_per_line = ratio [e, lOCode]: Calculates Halstead's effort per line of code, which may indicate coding intensity or potential defect density.  
3. operator_diversity = ratio [uniq_Op, total_Op]: Represents the diversity of operators used in the code, which could correlate with maintainability or defect likelihood.  

These features capture meaningful interactions between existing metrics while avoiding nesting or unsafe operations. They align with software engineering intuition about code quality and defect prediction.

2. effort_complexity_ratio_squared = square [effort_to_complexity_ratio]: Square the effort_to_complexity_ratio to amplify its predictive signal.  
3. op_operand_diff_sigmoid = sigmoid [op_operand_diff]: Apply sigmoid to op_operand_diff to bound its values between 0 and 1 for better scaling.
