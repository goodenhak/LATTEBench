You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code.
