Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.
