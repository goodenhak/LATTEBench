Reasoning:
1. monthly_burden: Creates a financially meaningful ratio that directly captures repayment capacity (higher values indicate higher risk)
2. log_credit_amount: Addresses the high variance (std=2873) and right skew in credit_amount through variance stabilization
3. checking_savings_interaction: Combines two important financial stability indicators that likely have synergistic predictive power

Reasoning:
1. Combining credit history with property ownership may reveal risk patterns (e.g., critical history with no property = higher risk)
2. The product of duration and amount represents total financial exposure, which may be more predictive than separate features
3. Employment-specific credit history patterns may exist, while age squared captures potential U-shaped risk relationships

Reasoning:
1. Age shows moderate right-skew (mean=35.8, median=33) - log transformation can normalize distribution and better capture non-linear relationships with credit approval
2. Credit history and savings status are both strong risk indicators - their interaction may reveal compound risk patterns not captured by individual features
3. Employment status categories may have different approval rates - target encoding can convert this categorical feature into a meaningful numerical representation while preserving its relationship with the target variable

3. <age_sigmoid><sigmoid><age><Sigmoid transformation of age to capture non-linear risk patterns>

Reasoning:
1. Target encoding for credit_history could capture its predictive power more effectively than the existing interaction feature, as credit history is a strong risk indicator
2. Combining savings status with property magnitude creates a comprehensive wealth assessment feature that might outperform individual features
3. Sigmoid transformation of age can better model the non-linear relationship between age and credit risk, where extreme ages (very young/old) may have different risk profiles

3. <credit_age_ratio><divide><credit_amount><age><Ratio of credit amount to age indicating financial burden relative to life stage>

Reasoning:
1. Binning existing_credits (range 1-4) could reveal non-linear patterns where having 1 vs 2+ credits affects risk differently, which might not be captured by the linear numerical representation
2. Age shows wide range (19-75) and likely has non-linear relationship with credit risk - younger and older applicants might have different risk profiles that binning can capture better than raw age
3. Credit amount relative to age could indicate different risk levels - a large loan for a young person might be riskier than for an older person with established income, creating a meaningful financial burden indicator
