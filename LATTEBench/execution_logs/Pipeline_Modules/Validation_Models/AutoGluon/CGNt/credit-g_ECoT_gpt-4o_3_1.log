   Reasoning: This new feature provides insight into how much credit the person is taking in relation to the duration. A higher ratio may indicate higher risk due to potentially larger monthly commitments.

2. \<employment_savings_interaction\> \<cross\> \<employment\> \<savings_status\> \<Interaction between employment and savings status\>  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between a person's employment duration and their saving habits. It might identify patterns where certain combinations of employment stability and savings status correlate with creditworthiness.

3. \<avg_credit_per_residence\> \<groupbythenmean\> \<residence_since\> \<credit_amount\> \<Average credit amount by years of residence\>  
   Reasoning: This feature provides the mean credit amount requested by individuals segmented by their years of residence. It may help in understanding if stability in residence correlates with credit amount and potentially inferred creditworthiness.

2025-08-27 01:56:57,989 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the specified operations:

1. <age_creditamount_interaction><multiply><age><credit_amount><Combined_effect_of_age_and_credit_amount_on_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By multiplying age with credit amount, we can capture how the applicant's age influences the requested credit amount, potentially highlighting different risk profiles or creditworthiness associated with different age groups requesting varying credit amounts.

2. <purpose_installment_cross><cross><purpose><installment_commitment><Interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_installment_commitment>
   - Reasoning: The purpose of the credit and the installment commitment rate are likely interacting in a way that affects the likelihood of receiving credit. By crossing these two features, we can identify if specific purposes are more likely to be approved when associated with certain installment rates.

3. <residence_property_concat><concat><residence_since><property_magnitude><Combination_of_years_of_residence_and_type_of_property_owned>
   - Reasoning: Years of residence and property magnitude may together indicate stability and financial standing. Concatenating these features could reveal patterns such as applicants with longer residences and higher-value properties being more likely to receive credit.

   Reasoning: This feature explores the relationship between a person's housing situation and their savings status. Certain combinations might indicate better financial stability or risk, which could be useful for credit risk assessment.

2. \<debt_to_income_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<installment_commitment\>\<Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment\>

   Reasoning: This feature captures the debt burden relative to disposable income commitments. A high debt-to-income ratio could indicate a higher credit risk, which might be crucial for determining creditworthiness.

3. \<credit_duration_ratio\>\<ratios\>\<credit_amount\>\<duration\>\<Credit_amount_per_month_duration_ratio\>

   Reasoning: This feature is designed to capture how much credit is being extended per month. A lower credit amount in relation to duration may indicate more manageable loan terms for the individual, potentially affecting credit approval decisions.

2025-08-27 02:04:44,751 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration>  
   Reasoning: This feature can identify how the credit amount compares to the loan duration, indicating affordability and credit risk over time.

2. <employment_property_age_cross><cross><employment><property_magnitude><age><Interaction_of_employment_property_and_applicant_age>  
   Reasoning: Combining these features can encapsulate the socioeconomic status and maturity of the applicant, potentially reflecting financial stability.

3. <personal_status_housing_concat><concat><personal_status><housing><Combined_effect_of_personal_status_and_housing>  
   Reasoning: Personal status and housing situation can jointly provide useful insights into lifestyle and financial obligations, potentially affecting creditworthiness.
