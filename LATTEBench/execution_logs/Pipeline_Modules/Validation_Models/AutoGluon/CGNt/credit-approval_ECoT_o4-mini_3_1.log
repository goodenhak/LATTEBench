2025-08-27 10:51:37,403 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed features to try next, along with the intuition behind each:

1. IndustryTargetEncoding: Different industries may have systematically different approval rates (e.g., Financials vs. Education). By encoding each industry with its historical success rate, we give the model a direct proxy for industry‐level risk.  
2. IncomeZscore: Income is extremely skewed (many zeros, a few very high earners). Standardizing it to a z‐score will normalize the distribution, making it easier for downstream models to use Income effectively.  
3. IncomeCreditInteraction: High income alone or a strong credit score alone may not be enough, but the combination of both is crucial. Multiplying Income by CreditScore captures this joint effect.

Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

Initial Accuracy = 0.8623188405797102. These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):
top 1: new features = <IndustryTargetEncoding><target_encoding><Industry><Mean acceptance rate by industry>|<IncomeZscore><zscore><Income><StandardizedIncome>|<IncomeCreditInteraction><multiply><Income><CreditScore><Interaction of income and credit score>, score = 0.021739130434782594

2025-08-27 10:52:34,152 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed new features with their rationale:

1. <AgeDebtRatio><ratio><Age><Debt><AgeToDebtRatio>  
   Rationale: Captures how a person’s age relates to their current debt burden, which may distinguish more responsible borrowers.

2. <IndustryAvgCreditScore><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><MeanCreditScoreByIndustry>  
   Rationale: Industries vary in typical creditworthiness; this feature encodes average credit score per industry to leverage group-level patterns.

3. <EthnicityEncoded><label_encode><Ethnicity><LabelEncodedEthnicity>  
   Rationale: Converts the categorical Ethnicity into a numerical format so the model can learn any systematic differences across groups.
