You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, no checking, >=200, 0<=X<200]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [250, 18424], Q1 = 1393.0, Median = 2302.5, Q3 = 3926.0, Mean = 3289.6367, Std = 2873.9759
- credit_amount_to_duration_ratio: Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration_for_better_cost_efficiency_analysis (numerical), range = [24.055554219135875, 2482.666252888958], Q1 = 86.31943245447718, Median = 130.74165468069555, Q3 = 201.01457369564284, Mean = 168.3365, Std = 174.1715
- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 60], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 21.1717, Std = 11.9703
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, no known savings, 100<=X<500, >=1000, 500<=X<1000]
- age: Age in years (numerical), range = [19, 75], Q1 = 27.0, Median = 33.0, Q3 = 42.0, Mean = 35.7750, Std = 11.8799
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [used car, radio/tv, new car, business, furniture/equipment, repairs, other, education, retraining, domestic appliance]
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [all paid, existing paid, critical/other existing credit, delayed previously, no credits/all paid]
- personal_status: Personal status (married, single,...) and sex (categorical), categories = [female div/dep/mar, male single, male mar/wid, male div/sep]
- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9983, Std = 1.1182
- employment: Present employment, in number of years. (categorical), categories = [1<=X<4, <1, >=7, 4<=X<7, unemployed]
- age_employment_cross: Interaction_between_age_and_employment_to_capture_relationships_affecting_creditworthiness (categorical), categories = [22_1<=X<4, 26_<1, ..., 63_1<=X<4]
- own_telephone: Telephone (categorical), categories = [none, yes]
- other_payment_plans: Other installment plans (banks, stores) (categorical), categories = [bank, none, stores]
- residence_since: Present residence since X years (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.8567, Std = 1.1067
- existing_credits: Number of existing credits at this bank (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 1.4133, Std = 0.5742

Answer: 1


Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
