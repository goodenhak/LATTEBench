2025-08-31 08:08:52,563 - INFO - LLM Output: {Debt Income 1 max divide, CreditScore 1 PriorDefault subtract multiply, Industry Income groupbythenmean}

Reasoning:
1. Debt-to-Income Ratio: Dividing debt by income (with 1 as floor to avoid division by zero) captures financial stability. Lower ratios indicate better repayment capacity.
2. Adjusted Credit Score: Multiplying credit score by (1 - PriorDefault) nullifies the score for prior defaulters, emphasizing clean credit history.
3. Industry Income Benchmark: Group mean income by industry provides context about economic sector norms, helping compare individual income against peers.

These features address financial health (ratio), credit history (interaction), and socioeconomic context (group statistic), which are critical for credit approval decisions.

2025-08-31 08:15:38,447 - INFO - LLM Output: {Debt CreditScore multiply, Income Industry_Income_groupbythenmean divide, YearsEmployed 1 plus log}

Reasoning:
1. Debt * CreditScore: Creates an interaction term that captures combined financial risk profile (higher debt with poor credit indicates higher risk)
2. Income / Industry_Income_groupbythenmean: Measures individual income relative to industry average, indicating financial standing within professional context
3. log(YearsEmployed + 1): Normalizes the right-skewed employment duration distribution while preserving employment stability information

These features capture:
- Multiplicative risk factors (debt and credit)
- Relative economic position within industry
- Logarithmic scaling of employment stability
All transformations are numerically stable and meaningful for creditworthiness assessment.

2025-08-31 08:34:25,116 - INFO - LLM Output: { Debt Income Gender Gender equal plus divide, Income Gender Gender equal plus log, Ethnicity Income groupbythenmean }

Reasoning:
1. Debt-to-Income ratio with constant adjustment: Debt divided by (Income + 1) handles cases where Income is zero by adding a constant 1 (created using Gender Gender equal). This ratio is a key metric in credit scoring, as it measures the applicant's debt burden relative to their income, which influences creditworthiness.
2. Log transformation of Income: Log(Income + 1) reduces the skewness of the Income distribution (which has a high standard deviation) and makes it more normally distributed, improving model performance for linear-based algorithms. The constant 1 is added to handle zero income.
3. Mean Income by Ethnicity: Grouping Income by Ethnicity provides the average income for each ethnic group, which can capture socioeconomic patterns that may affect credit approval decisions. This encoding leverages categorical information for better predictive power.
