Reasoning:
1. loc v(g) iv(g) plus plus log: This creates a composite complexity measure by summing LOC, cyclomatic complexity, and design complexity, then applying log transformation. This captures the combined effect of code size and structural complexity, which are strong indicators of defect proneness. The log transform helps handle the skewed distributions.

2. loc v(g) multiply e multiply sqrt: This creates an interaction term between code size (loc), complexity (v(g)), and development effort (e). Multiplying these features captures their synergistic effect on defect probability. The square root transformation reduces the impact of extreme outliers while preserving the interaction effect.

3. branchCount total_Op total_Opnd plus plus reciprocal: This creates a measure of code density by taking the reciprocal of the sum of control flow complexity (branchCount) and total operations. Higher values indicate more complex, dense code that is more likely to contain defects. The reciprocal transformation inverts the relationship so higher values correspond to higher complexity density.

These features combine different aspects of code complexity (size, structure, and operational characteristics) that are known to correlate with software defects, while using appropriate transformations to handle the highly skewed distributions typical of software metrics data.

Reasoning:
1. loc v(g) iv(g) plus plus log: This creates a logarithmic transformation of the sum of three fundamental McCabe complexity metrics (loc, cyclomatic complexity, and design complexity). Logarithmic transformations help handle skewed distributions and make relationships more linear, which is beneficial for many ML models. The combination of these three metrics captures both size (loc) and structural complexity (v(g), iv(g)) in a single feature.

2. loc v(g) multiply e multiply sqrt: This combines code size (loc), structural complexity (v(g)), and development effort (e) through multiplication and square root transformation. The square root helps reduce the impact of extreme values while preserving the multiplicative interaction effect. This feature captures the joint effect of code size, complexity, and effort metrics, which are likely to have synergistic effects on defect probability.

3. branchCount total_Op total_Opnd plus plus reciprocal: This creates a reciprocal transformation of the sum of control flow complexity (branchCount) and Halstead operator/operand metrics. The reciprocal transformation emphasizes small values and creates a non-linear relationship that might better capture threshold effects where defect probability increases rapidly beyond certain complexity levels. This feature combines structural and lexical complexity aspects.

2025-08-29 23:53:53,338 - INFO - LLM Output: Analyzing the KC1 software defect prediction dataset, I see several opportunities for feature engineering based on code complexity metrics and their relationships. The existing features already include some engineered features, but I can create additional ones that capture meaningful interactions and non-linear relationships.

Three new features that could improve predictive performance:

1. Complexity Density Feature: The ratio of cyclomatic complexity to code size, as higher complexity per line often indicates more defect-prone code. I'll use v(g) divided by loc with a log transform to handle the skewed distribution.

2. Halstead Effort Concentration: The product of Halstead effort and volume, normalized by code size. This captures how much intellectual effort is concentrated in each line of code, which could indicate error-prone sections.

3. Operator Density Interaction: The interaction between unique operators and total operators, divided by code size. This measures how operator diversity scales with code complexity, which might reveal patterns associated with defects.

Reasoning:
1. uniq_Op total_Opnd plus reciprocal: This creates a feature representing the inverse of total operators + operands, which captures code density. Modules with very low values (many operations) might be more complex and prone to defects, while high values (few operations) might be simpler. The reciprocal transformation helps handle the skewed distribution.

2. v e multiply loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt multiply sqrt: This combines Halstead volume (v), effort (e), and the existing complex feature loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt. Multiplying these complexity metrics together and taking the square root creates a composite complexity indicator that captures nonlinear relationships between these fundamental code metrics, which are likely strongly associated with defect proneness.

3. iv(g) ev(g) subtract abs: This calculates the absolute difference between McCabe's design complexity and essential complexity. A large difference between these two complexity measures might indicate irregular control flow structures that could be associated with higher defect rates, while values close to zero might represent more straightforward code.

Reasoning:
1. uniq_Op total_Opnd plus reciprocal: This creates a feature representing the inverse of the total number of operators and operands. This could capture the density of unique operations - modules with fewer total operations but high uniqueness might be more complex and prone to defects. The reciprocal transformation helps normalize the distribution.

2. v d divide log: Halstead's volume divided by difficulty, then log-transformed. This ratio represents volume per unit of difficulty - higher values might indicate modules that accomplish more with less complexity. The log transform helps handle the wide range of values and makes the feature more normally distributed.

3. e loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt divide sqrt: This creates a normalized version of Halstead's effort by dividing it by the square root of the complex feature loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt. This helps scale the effort metric relative to other code complexity measures, potentially creating a more informative feature about the actual development effort required per unit of code complexity.

These features were designed to:
- Create meaningful ratios between existing complexity metrics
- Apply appropriate transformations (log, sqrt, reciprocal) to handle skewed distributions
- Capture interactions between different types of complexity measures (Halstead and McCabe metrics)
- Normalize extreme values that are common in software metrics data
- Create features that are more likely to have linear relationships with the target variable

2025-08-30 00:01:02,156 - INFO - LLM Output: [uniq_Op total_Opnd plus reciprocal, v d multiply, e loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt multiply sqrt]

Reasoning:
1. uniq_Op total_Opnd plus reciprocal: This creates a feature representing the inverse of total operators + operands. This could capture the density of unique operations in the code - modules with fewer unique operations relative to total operations might be more defect-prone due to code repetition or lack of modularization.

2. v d multiply: Multiplying Halstead's volume by difficulty creates a compound complexity measure. Both metrics individually relate to code complexity, and their product might better capture the overall cognitive complexity that could lead to defects.

3. e loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt multiply sqrt: This creates a feature that combines Halstead's effort with the existing engineered feature (which itself combines LOC, McCabe complexity, and effort). Taking the square root helps normalize the distribution of this potentially highly skewed feature while preserving the relationship between effort and complexity metrics.

These features combine complementary complexity metrics (Halstead and McCabe), create normalized versions of highly skewed features, and generate compound measures that might better capture the multidimensional nature of code complexity associated with defects.

2025-08-30 00:04:56,005 - INFO - LLM Output: [uniq_Op total_Opnd plus reciprocal, v e multiply sqrt, loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt v divide]

Reasoning:
1. uniq_Op total_Opnd plus reciprocal: This creates a feature representing the inverse of total vocabulary size (unique operators + unique operands). Smaller modules with dense vocabulary might be more defect-prone, and the reciprocal transformation helps normalize the distribution while preserving this relationship.

2. v e multiply sqrt: This combines Halstead's volume and effort metrics, which are fundamental code complexity measures. Multiplying them captures their interaction effect, and the square root helps handle the extreme right-skewness in these metrics while maintaining predictive power.

3. loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt v divide: This creates a ratio between the complex interaction feature (LOC × McCabe complexity × effort) and Halstead's volume. This normalizes the complex feature by code size complexity, potentially capturing defect density rather than absolute complexity measures.

These features were designed to:
- Capture interactions between fundamental code metrics (Halstead, McCabe)
- Handle the extreme skewness in the original features through appropriate transformations
- Create normalized measures that represent code quality ratios rather than absolute values
- Maintain interpretability while providing new predictive signals for defect prediction

Reasoning:
1. uniq_Op total_Opnd plus reciprocal: This creates a feature representing the inverse of the total number of operations (unique operators + total operands). This could capture the density of operations - modules with fewer total operations but higher defect rates might have this inverse relationship. The reciprocal transformation helps with skewed distributions.

2. v d divide log: This calculates the log of Halstead volume divided by difficulty. This ratio represents volume per unit of difficulty - higher values might indicate more complex code structures that are prone to defects. The log transformation helps normalize the potentially wide range of values.

3. e loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt multiply sqrt: This creates a compound feature that combines Halstead effort with the existing engineered feature loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt. The square root helps reduce the extreme skewness while preserving the relationship between McCabe complexity metrics and Halstead effort, which together might better predict defect-prone modules.

Reasoning:
1. uniq_Opnd total_Opnd plus reciprocal: This creates a feature representing the inverse of the total number of unique and total operands. This could capture the operand density - modules with fewer but more frequently used operands might have different defect characteristics than those with many unique operands used infrequently.

2. v e multiply sqrt: This combines Halstead's volume and effort metrics, which are fundamental measures of code complexity. Taking the square root helps normalize the distribution since both features have extremely high variance and right-skewed distributions, making the relationship more linear and easier for models to learn.

3. loc_v(g)_multiply_e_multiply_sqrt e_v_multiply_loc_divide_sqrt multiply log: This creates an interaction term between two existing engineered features that already combine multiple complexity metrics (McCabe's v(g), Halstead's e, and LOC). The logarithm helps compress the wide range of values while preserving the multiplicative relationship that might capture complex interactions between different types of code complexity measures.
