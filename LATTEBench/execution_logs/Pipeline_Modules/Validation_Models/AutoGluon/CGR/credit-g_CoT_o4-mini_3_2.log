2025-08-29 20:31:18,904 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed features along with the intuition:

1.  “Monthly‐payment‐estimate”: the total credit divided by its duration gives an estimate of the average “per‐month” burden, which often drives default risk.  
2.  “Installment‐burden‐ratio”: dividing the credit amount by the installment rate captures how heavy each percentage point of instalment really is in absolute terms.  
3.  “Avg‐amt‐by‐credit‐history”: for each credit‐history category, we compute the mean past credit amount. This encodes the typical loan size associated with each history bucket.

RPN expressions for these three new features:

1. Log-transformed credit amount  
   - credit_amount is highly right-skewed; taking log stabilizes variance and often improves linear separators.  
   RPN: credit_amount log

2. Relative credit amount versus peers in the same employment category

2025-08-29 20:38:33,368 - INFO - LLM Output: Reasoning:
1. Taking the logarithm of credit_amount helps compress its long‐tailed distribution and makes the model less sensitive to extreme values.
2. Binning age into 5 categories can capture non‐linear effects of life stage (youth, early career, mid‐life, etc.) on credit approval.
3. Computing the average credit_amount for each job group (job credit_amount groupbythenmean) captures typical borrowing patterns per occupation.

2025-08-29 20:39:40,798 - INFO - LLM Output: Below are three proposed new features (in RPN) along with the reasoning for each:

1. credit_amount age divide  
   • Reasoning:  Normalizes the loan size by borrower’s age—older clients taking unusually large loans may carry different risk profiles than younger borrowers with the same amount.  

2. purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean  
   • Reasoning:  Captures the typical loan size per purpose; borrowers whose requested amounts deviate significantly from the mean for that purpose may present higher risk.  

3. credit_history delayed previously equal  
   • Reasoning:  Direct binary flag for any past delays, a strong indicator of repayment behavior.

[  
  credit_amount job credit_amount groupbythenmean divide,  
  duration credit_history duration groupbythenmedian subtract abs,  
  checking_status savings_status cross  
]

Reasoning:  
1. “credit_amount job credit_amount groupbythenmean divide” measures how large a person’s loan is relative to the average for their job class—higher ratios may signal higher risk.  
2. “duration credit_history duration groupbythenmedian subtract abs” captures how far someone’s loan term deviates from the typical term given their credit‐history category—extreme deviations might indicate nonstandard risk profiles.  
3. “checking_status savings_status cross” creates interaction levels between checking‐account and savings categories, letting the model pick up combined effects of liquidity that neither individual feature can fully express on its own.

[credit_amount_duration_divide installment_commitment divide log, purpose credit_amount_duration_divide groupbythenmean, checking_status savings_status cross]

Reasoning:
1. “credit_amount_duration_divide installment_commitment divide log”  
   - We approximate the applicant’s disposable income by dividing the estimated monthly payment (credit_amount_duration_divide) by the installment rate (percentage of income), then apply a log transform to reduce skew and stabilize variance.  
2. “purpose credit_amount_duration_divide groupbythenmean”  
   - We encode for each credit purpose the average monthly payment burden. This captures known differences in repayment patterns by purpose (e.g. car vs. education vs. business).  
3. “checking_status savings_status cross”  
   - By crossing checking account status with savings status we capture joint liquidity profiles (e.g. no checking + low savings vs. healthy checking + high savings) in a single feature.
