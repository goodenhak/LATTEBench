2025-08-29 20:51:41,886 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three engineered features that should help capture borrower risk more effectively:

1. Average monthly installment burden: dividing the total loan amount by its duration shows how heavy the monthly outflow is.  
2. Credit-to-savings ratio: normalizing the loan size by the borrower’s savings status highlights cases where savings are low relative to the loan.  
3. Mean loan size per purpose: encoding the typical credit amount for each loan purpose can reveal if an applicant’s request is unusually large for that category.  

RPN expressions for these features:

3. Interaction between an encoded job risk level and the installment commitment rate, to capture how job category modifies repayment pressure.

2025-08-29 21:02:42,871 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features designed to capture relative risk and burden beyond raw amounts:

1. Credit‐to‐Savings Ratio  
   • Reasoning: A high requested credit relative to a customer’s existing savings suggests greater risk of default. By label‐encoding the savings category and dividing the credit amount by this encoded value, we normalize the loan size by each applicant’s savings level.

2. Credit Relative to Purpose‐Specific Average  
   • Reasoning: Some purposes (e.g. “business,” “new car”) typically come with higher or lower average loan sizes. Taking the ratio of an individual’s request to the mean loan for the same purpose highlights outliers who borrow much more or much less than peers in that category.

3. Total Installment Burden  
   • Reasoning: A higher installment rate over a longer duration implies a larger cumulative repayment burden. Multiplying installment_commitment by duration approximates total repayment pressure.

Final RPN expressions for these features:
[savings_status label_encode credit_amount divide, credit_amount purpose groupbythenmean divide, installment_commitment duration multiply]

2025-08-29 21:05:43,156 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features (in RPN) with the reasoning behind each:

1) “credit_amount installment_commitment divide log”  
   – We first normalize the loan size by the installment rate (credit_amount ÷ installment_commitment) to get a per-unit commitment cost, then take the log to reduce skew and handle outliers.

2) “credit_history credit_amount groupbythenrank”  
   – Within each credit‐history category, we rank the applicant’s credit amount. This captures how large this loan is relative to peers with similar histories.

3) “personal_status credit_amount groupbythenmean”  
   – We compute the average credit amount per personal_status group, giving a context-aware baseline loan size for each marital/sex category.

Output in RPN list form:
