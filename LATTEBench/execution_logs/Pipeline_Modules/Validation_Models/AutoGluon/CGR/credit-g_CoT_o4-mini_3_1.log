[  
  credit_amount savings_status label_encode divide,  
  job credit_amount groupbythenmean,  
  age 5 bin  
]

Reasoning:

1. credit_amount savings_status label_encode divide  
   – “debt‐to‐savings‐status” ratio. We first label‐encode the savings_status ordinally, then divide credit_amount by that code. Captures how large a loan is relative to the applicant’s savings category.  

2. job credit_amount groupbythenmean  
   – average credit_amount per job category. Encodes typical loan sizes by profession, helping the model spot unusually large or small loans for each job type.  

3. age 5 bin  
   – discretize age into five bins. Captures non‐linear age effects (e.g. different risk groups at different life stages).

2025-08-29 20:25:08,777 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features in RPN form:

1. Monthly installment burden: multiply the per‐month credit (credit_amount_duration_divide) by the installment rate, to capture the absolute monthly payment as % of income.  
2. Credit‐to‐age ratio: divide the requested credit by the borrower’s age, to penalize large loans for younger or less‐established clients.  
3. Combined liquidity status: cross checking account and savings status into one feature, then label‐encode, to capture joint effects of account and savings on risk.

[Rather than using any raw plus/minus on categoricals, we use cross + label_encode for #3.]

Final RPN list:

2025-08-29 20:26:15,270 - INFO - LLM Output: I propose the following three new features (in RPN) to help the model capture different aspects of “debt burden,” “savings‐to‐credit skew,” and an “employment–history interaction.”

1. Debt‐burden ratio:  
   Estimate how heavy the loan burden is relative to monthly repayment capacity  
   RPN:  
     credit_amount duration installment_commitment multiply divide  
   – Reasoning: credit_amount / (duration * installment_rate) approximates the fraction of income devoted to each credit, a more direct “stress‐test” of repayment.  

2. Log‐transform of the savings‐to‐credit ratio:  
   Smooth out the heavy right‐tail and make this ratio more Gaussian  
   RPN:  
     savings_status_label_encode_credit_amount_ratio log  
   – Reasoning: the raw ratio is highly skewed, so taking the log can stabilize variance and help models better separate low vs. high savers relative to their credit size.  

3. Employment × credit‐history interaction:  
   Weight the historical default risk by the applicant’s employment level  
   RPN:  
     employment label_encode credit_history_target_target_encoding multiply  
   – Reasoning: by label‐encoding “employment” (junior=1…senior=4) and multiplying it with the target‐encoded default probability of the credit history, we bias the final risk score toward how stable their job is.  

Final output (RPN list format):  
[credit_amount duration installment_commitment multiply divide, savings_status_label_encode_credit_amount_ratio log, employment label_encode credit_history_target_target_encoding multiply]

Reasoning:  
1. “installment_commitment credit_amount divide” captures the proportion of loan amount taken as regular installments, directly reflecting repayment burden.  
2. “employment label_encode credit_history_target_target_encoding groupbythenmean” creates a smoothed risk-level estimate per employment category by averaging historical default rates.  
3. “purpose housing cross” encodes combined effects of why a customer applies and their living situation, uncovering interaction patterns not visible when treated separately.
