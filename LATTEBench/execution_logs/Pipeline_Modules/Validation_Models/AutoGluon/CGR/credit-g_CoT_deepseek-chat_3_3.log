2025-08-29 18:47:11,660 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task and available features, I'll create 3 new features that capture meaningful relationships and patterns to improve credit prediction performance:

1. Duration-adjusted credit risk score: Combines credit history with duration to create a risk score where longer durations with problematic credit history indicate higher risk
2. Employment stability weighted by property: Creates a stability index where employment duration is weighted by property ownership (real estate indicates more stability)
3. Savings-to-credit ratio with status adjustment: Calculates a financial safety ratio adjusted by savings account status

[credit_history duration cross employment property_magnitude cross multiply, credit_amount savings_status label_encode divide, installment_commitment residence_since multiply num_dependents divide]

Reasoning:
1. credit_history duration cross employment property_magnitude cross multiply: This creates a comprehensive risk profile by crossing credit history with loan duration (longer problematic history = higher risk), then crossing with employment stability and property ownership (real estate = lower risk), and multiplying to create a weighted risk score.

2. credit_amount savings_status label_encode divide: Converts savings status to numerical values, then calculates the ratio of credit amount to savings status. This captures the borrower's ability to cover the credit based on their savings level.

3. installment_commitment residence_since multiply num_dependents divide: Creates a financial burden index by multiplying installment commitment with residence stability (longer residence = more stability), then dividing by number of dependents to account for family financial obligations.

2025-08-29 18:49:19,554 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task and available features, I'll generate 3 new features that should improve credit prediction performance by capturing meaningful interactions and relationships:

1. Credit utilization ratio: This captures how much of the available credit line a person is using relative to their income stability
   [checking_status credit_amount multiply duration divide installment_commitment multiply]

2. Employment stability weighted by property ownership: Combines employment duration with property magnitude to assess financial stability
   [employment property_magnitude cross credit_history label_encode multiply]

3. Savings-to-credit ratio with dependency adjustment: Measures savings capacity relative to credit amount while accounting for dependents
   [savings_status label_encode credit_amount multiply num_dependents divide residence_since multiply]

Reasoning:
- The first feature creates a credit utilization ratio that considers checking status, credit amount, duration, and installment commitment - key indicators of credit management behavior
- The second feature combines employment stability with property ownership and credit history, creating a composite stability score that's highly relevant for credit risk assessment
- The third feature adjusts savings capacity by credit obligations and family dependencies, capturing the applicant's ability to manage debt while supporting dependents

These features leverage meaningful financial relationships that are known to be predictive in credit scoring models while avoiding problematic operations on categorical variables.

1. Credit utilization ratio: credit_amount checking_status label_encode divide
   - Reasoning: This creates a ratio of credit amount to checking account status (encoded numerically), which indicates how much credit is being requested relative to the person's checking account status. Higher ratios may indicate riskier credit requests.

2. Employment stability weighted by residence duration: employment residence_since multiply
   - Reasoning: Multiplying employment duration by residence duration creates a composite stability score. People with longer employment AND residence stability are generally better credit risks as they demonstrate consistent life patterns.

3. Savings-to-credit ratio with property consideration: savings_status label_encode credit_amount divide property_magnitude label_encode multiply
   - Reasoning: This creates a ratio of savings status to credit amount, then weights it by property magnitude. This captures both the person's savings capacity relative to their credit request and their existing asset base, providing a comprehensive financial health indicator.

2025-08-29 19:01:33,012 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task and available features, I'll generate 3 new features that should improve credit prediction performance by capturing meaningful interactions and relationships:

1. Duration-adjusted credit risk score: Combines credit history with duration to create a risk assessment that accounts for both payment history and loan term
   [credit_history duration cross]

2. Income-adjusted installment burden: Measures the installment commitment relative to credit amount to assess repayment capacity
   [installment_commitment credit_amount divide]

3. Employment stability and property collateral score: Combines employment duration with property magnitude to assess financial stability and collateral strength
   [employment property_magnitude cross]

Reasoning:
- The first feature captures the interaction between credit history (payment behavior) and loan duration (risk exposure time)
- The second feature creates a debt-to-income ratio variant that's crucial for credit risk assessment
- The third feature combines employment stability (income reliability) with property ownership (collateral value) for comprehensive risk evaluation
- These features leverage domain knowledge about credit scoring while avoiding problematic operations on categorical variables

2025-08-29 19:02:45,571 - INFO - LLM Output: [credit_amount duration divide, credit_amount_duration_ratio credit_amount multiply, checking_status credit_history cross employment cross]

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration divide: This creates a direct ratio of credit amount to loan duration, which captures the monthly payment burden more directly than the provided credit_amount_duration_ratio. This is a fundamental financial metric that strongly indicates repayment capacity.

2. credit_amount_duration_ratio credit_amount multiply: This interaction term amplifies the effect of both the payment ratio and the absolute credit amount. Large loans with high payment ratios represent significantly higher risk, while small loans with high ratios might be more manageable.

3. checking_status credit_history cross employment cross: This creates a powerful triple interaction between three critical risk factors: banking status, credit history, and employment stability. This captures complex risk profiles that simple pairwise interactions might miss (e.g., someone with no checking account, poor credit history, AND unstable employment represents extreme risk).

These features were chosen because:
- They create meaningful financial ratios that directly measure repayment capacity
- They amplify risk signals through multiplicative interactions
- They capture high-order interactions between the most important categorical risk factors
- They avoid problematic operations on categorical features (using cross instead)
- They complement rather than duplicate the existing engineered features

2025-08-29 19:05:01,830 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task of predicting whether a person receives credit (binary classification) and the provided features, I'll generate 3 new features that could improve model performance by capturing meaningful interactions and relationships:

1. Duration-adjusted credit risk score: Combining credit history with duration and installment commitment to create a risk assessment feature
   - credit_history duration cross installment_commitment cross creates a categorical interaction that captures how payment history, loan duration, and income commitment interact
   - Reasoning: This creates a comprehensive risk profile by combining repayment behavior, loan term, and financial burden

2. Wealth-to-debt ratio: Creating a numerical feature that compares assets to credit obligations
   - property_magnitude label_encode credit_amount multiply savings_status label_encode divide
   - Reasoning: This ratio captures the applicant's ability to repay by comparing their assets (property + savings) to the requested credit amount

3. Employment stability weighted by residence stability: Combining employment and residence stability indicators
   - employment label_encode residence_since multiply num_dependents subtract
   - Reasoning: Longer employment and residence indicate stability, while more dependents might indicate higher financial pressure - this creates a stability score

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration divide: This creates a direct ratio of credit amount to duration, which might capture the monthly payment burden more accurately than the provided credit_amount_duration_ratio (which appears to be credit_amount/duration but with different values). Comparing this with the existing feature could reveal discrepancies or provide a cleaner version.

2. credit_amount_duration_ratio credit_amount_duration_ratio mean subtract abs: This calculates the absolute deviation of the ratio from its mean, which could help identify outliers or extreme cases where the payment burden is unusually high or low, potentially affecting credit approval.

3. checking_status credit_history cross: While there's already a cross feature, creating a simpler interaction between these two important categorical features (checking account status and credit history) might capture additional nuanced patterns that the more complex existing cross feature misses.

4. credit_amount duration multiply savings_status label_encode divide: This creates a feature that represents (credit_amount * duration) / encoded_savings_status. This could capture the relationship between the total credit obligation (amount * duration) and the client's savings strength, which might be predictive of repayment ability.

The first three features are prioritized as they focus on:
- Creating a cleaner version of an existing important feature
- Identifying outliers in that feature
- Building a simpler categorical interaction that might complement the existing complex one

These operations avoid inappropriate mathematical operations on categorical features and focus on creating meaningful numerical relationships and interactions that could improve the model's ability to distinguish between creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration divide credit_amount_duration_ratio subtract abs: This creates a feature that measures the absolute deviation between the actual credit_amount/duration ratio and the engineered credit_amount_duration_ratio feature. Large deviations might indicate data inconsistencies or special cases that could be predictive of credit risk.

2. checking_status credit_history cross credit_history_duration_cross_employment_property_magnitude_cross_multiply concat: This combines two powerful categorical interaction features by concatenating their string representations. The checking_status_credit_history_cross captures banking relationship status, while credit_history_duration_cross_employment_property_magnitude_cross_multiply captures employment stability with asset ownership. Their combination might reveal complex patterns in creditworthiness.

3. credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide installment_commitment_residence_since_multiply_num_dependents_divide multiply log: This creates a logarithmic feature that combines the credit amount normalized by savings status with the installment commitment adjusted for residence duration and dependents. The log transformation helps handle the extreme range of the first feature while capturing the multiplicative relationship between credit capacity and repayment burden.

2025-08-29 19:10:38,017 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task and features, I'll generate 3 new features that should improve credit prediction performance by capturing important interactions and relationships:

1. Duration-adjusted credit risk score: Combining credit history with duration to create a risk assessment feature
   - credit_history duration cross - Creates categorical combinations of credit history patterns with loan duration

2. Income-to-debt burden ratio: Measuring financial capacity by relating installment commitment to credit amount
   - credit_amount installment_commitment divide - Shows what percentage of income goes toward debt payments

3. Employment stability weighted by property ownership: Combining employment duration with property ownership as a stability indicator
   - employment property_magnitude cross - Creates categorical combinations of job stability with asset ownership

[credit_history duration cross, credit_amount installment_commitment divide, employment property_magnitude cross]

Reasoning:
1. The credit_history x duration cross feature captures how different credit history patterns interact with loan duration - longer loans with poor credit history are much riskier
2. The credit_amount/installment_commitment ratio measures debt burden relative to income, which is a strong predictor of repayment capacity
3. Employment x property cross combines job stability with asset ownership, creating a powerful stability indicator - employed individuals with property are much better credit risks

These features leverage domain knowledge about credit risk assessment: payment history, debt-to-income ratios, and borrower stability are fundamental factors in credit decisions.
