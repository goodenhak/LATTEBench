Reasoning:

1. credit_amount duration divide: Creates a monthly burden ratio. Higher values indicate larger monthly payments relative to loan duration, which is a strong risk indicator. This captures interaction between two critical numerical features.

2. checking_status label_encode: Converts the ordinal categorical feature (no checking → <0 → 0<=X<200 → >=200) into numerical values preserving the natural order. This helps linear models capture the progressive risk associated with checking account status.

3. employment credit_amount groupbythenmean: Creates group statistics showing average loan size per employment category. Longer employment generally correlates with higher stability, and this feature captures how loan amounts vary by employment status, which may indicate different risk profiles.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount_duration_divide 100 multiply installment_commitment divide estimates disposable income by leveraging the relationship between monthly payment (credit_amount/duration), installment commitment, and disposable income. This feature may better capture financial stability and ability to repay, which is crucial for credit decisions.
2. credit_amount log applies a logarithmic transformation to address the right-skewness of credit_amount, making the distribution more normal and potentially improving model performance, especially for linear models.
3. credit_history duration groupbythenmean computes the average loan duration for each credit history category, which may reflect risk assessment patterns (e.g., shorter durations for riskier histories) and provide numerical insights beyond the categorical feature alone.

Reasoning:
1. Deviation from mean credit amount for employment group: This feature captures whether the loan amount is unusually high or low for the applicant's employment status, which may indicate higher risk or atypical borrowing behavior.
2. Loan amount per year of age: This ratio provides a measure of the credit burden relative to the applicant's age, potentially identifying cases where younger applicants are taking on disproportionately large loans.
3. Z-score of credit amount within purpose: This standardizes the loan amount based on the purpose group, highlighting outliers that may be riskier due to unusual loan sizes for their intended use.

2025-08-30 21:16:51,246 - INFO - LLM Output: [credit_amount installment_commitment divide, employment residence_since plus, property_magnitude savings_status concat credit_amount groupbythenmean]

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount divided by installment_commitment creates a debt-to-income ratio feature that captures repayment capacity
2. employment duration plus residence stability provides a combined stability metric
3. Property magnitude and savings status concatenation grouped with credit amount mean captures how different asset/savings combinations affect typical loan sizes, which may indicate risk patterns

These features incorporate:
- Financial capacity ratios (debt-to-income)
- Stability metrics (employment + residence)
- Interactive effects between assets and credit behavior
All of which are known to be important factors in credit risk assessment.
