2025-08-31 09:59:21,615 - INFO - LLM Output: { Income Age Age divide plus Debt divide , Income Employed multiply , Ethnicity target_encoding }

Reasoning behind the new features:

1. Debt-to-Income ratio with smoothing: The feature Income Age Age divide plus Debt divide computes Debt divided by (Income + 1) to avoid division by zero. This ratio is a key metric in credit scoring, as high debt relative to income can indicate financial stress and higher risk of default. Adding 1 to Income ensures numerical stability when Income is zero, which is common in the dataset (Income has min 0). This feature may help the model capture an applicant's ability to manage debt.

2. Income and employment interaction: The feature Income Employed multiply interacts Income with Employed status. This highlights the importance of income only when the applicant is employed, as unemployed individuals may have unreliable income streams. This interaction can help the model distinguish between employed applicants with income and unemployed applicants, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

3. Ethnicity target encoding: The feature Ethnicity target_encoding applies target encoding to the Ethnicity categorical variable. This encoding captures the historical success rate per ethnic group, which may reveal biases or patterns in credit card approvals that are not directly explained by other features. Target encoding is effective for categorical variables with multiple categories, as it provides a numerical representation that can be leveraged by downstream models.
