2025-08-30 12:07:34,977 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the prediction of credit card application success, we'll create three new features using feature engineering techniques. Our goal is to highlight relationships or transformations that are not immediately obvious from the input features but could improve model performance. Here's the reasoning behind each one:

1. Meaningful Interaction of Employment and Prior Default:
   - People who are employed but have prior defaults might be in a riskier category despite having a job. We'll create a feature that highlights this interaction.
   - RPN: Employed PriorDefault multiply

2. Credit Score Z-Score:
   - Transforming the credit score into a z-score will help standardize this feature, which might help some models if the distribution has large variability.
   - RPN: CreditScore zscore

3. Income to Debt Ratio:
   - People with better financial management might have a favorable income to debt ratio. Creating this ratio will help capture this dynamic.
   - RPN: Income Debt divide

These features are chosen strategically to highlight interactions and standardized transformations that are beneficial for predictive models. Here are the RPN expressions:

2025-08-30 12:09:03,028 - INFO - LLM Output: Here's a feature engineering proposal to improve the downstream model's performance for predicting successful credit card applications. The rationale for each feature is explained below:

1. CreditScore to Income Ratio: By calculating the ratio of CreditScore to Income, we aim to capture the relative creditworthiness of an applicant concerning their income. A higher ratio may suggest better credit health relative to income.

2. Employment Consistency: This feature calculates the ratio of YearsEmployed to Age. It evaluates how consistently the person has been employed throughout their life. A higher ratio indicates a stable career path relative to age, which can positively influence the likelihood of credit card approval.

3. Prior Default and Industry Interaction: Cross the PriorDefault feature with Industry to observe how different industries might influence the impact of having prior defaults. This interaction might reveal that certain industries could be more forgiving of past financial behavior.

RPN Notation:

[CreditScore Income divide, YearsEmployed Age divide, Industry PriorDefault cross]


Explanation:
1. CreditScore to Income Ratio: [CreditScore Income divide]
   - This feature helps to understand if the credit score is justified according to the person's income, potentially reflecting financial discipline.

2. Employment Consistency: [YearsEmployed Age divide]
   - This captures how consistently a person has been employed throughout their life, indicating reliability and work stability.

3. Prior Default and Industry Interaction: [Industry PriorDefault cross]
   - By considering the interaction between prior default and industry, we aim to capture nuanced patterns that specific industries may exhibit in terms of credit behavior and recovery from defaults.

3. Marital Financial Profile: Analyze the financial profile concerning marital status and bank customer status by using Married and BankCustomer, then integrating income to see how these influence the financial outlook.
   \[
   \text{expression: } \text{Married BankCustomer plus 2 divide Income multiply}
   \]
   \[
   \text{RPN: } \text{[Married BankCustomer plus 2 divide Income multiply]}
   \]

Combining these features can expose latent patterns in financial behavior, employment stability, and marital financial dynamics that could have predictive power for assessing credit card application success.

2025-08-30 12:11:32,934 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the predictions for credit card application success, let's generate three new features through feature engineering using the provided operators. Our aim is to create features that might better capture complex relationships in the data:

1. Interaction Between Income and Debt:
   - People with lower income and higher debt might have more difficulty being approved for a credit card. We will engineer a feature that captures the ratio of debt to income when income is non-zero.
   - RPN: [Debt Income ratio]

2. Creditworthiness Score:
   - A feature that combines CreditScore and YearsEmployed can provide a proxy for creditworthiness. Someone with a higher credit score and more years of employment may have a higher chance of approval.
   - RPN: [CreditScore YearsEmployed multiply]

3. Industry and Employment Interaction Feature:
   - Understanding which industries have higher approval rates can be insightful. We'll use groupbythenmean to compute the average employment status by industry, which might elucidate patterns between specific industries and employment affecting credit card approval likelihood.
   - RPN: [Industry Employed groupbythenmean]

Output: 
[Debt Income ratio, CreditScore YearsEmployed multiply, Industry Employed groupbythenmean]

   - RPN: Debt Income ratio

2. Employed Weighted by Years Employed: This feature captures the idea that being employed for a longer duration might increase creditworthiness. It assigns more weight to those who are both employed and have long work histories.
   - RPN: Employed YearsEmployed multiply

3. Credit Score Normalized by Prior Defaults: A higher credit score normalized by the presence of prior defaults can indicate better credit management. Individuals with prior defaults but high credit scores may still get approved.
   - RPN: CreditScore PriorDefault add CreditScore divide

2025-08-30 12:15:51,853 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the predictions in the credit card application model, we want to engineer features that can offer us additional insights. Given the context and available operations, the following features are proposed in Reverse Polish Notation:

1. Relationship between Credit Score and Debt: 
   - Rationale: A high credit score typically correlates with responsible debt management. Calculating the ratio of CreditScore to Debt can highlight individuals who manage their debt efficiently relative to their credit score.
   - RPN: [CreditScore Debt divide]

2. Interaction between Income and Years Employed: 
   - Rationale: Individuals with more years of employment may have higher incomes due to experience and seniority. Multiplying these features will capture this economic stability and enhance predictive power.
   - RPN: [Income YearsEmployed multiply]

3. Combining Marital Status and Bank Customer Status: 
   - Rationale: Married individuals with bank accounts may represent a demographic that's more financially stable or inclined to financial products. By crossing these two features, we can explore any compounded effect they may have on successful credit card applications.
   - RPN: [Married BankCustomer cross]

Output:
[CreditScore Debt divide, Income YearsEmployed multiply, Married BankCustomer cross]

2025-08-30 12:17:01,843 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that improve the downstream model's performance, we should focus on creating features that capture additional information or interactions that might help in predicting the success of credit card applications. Here, I'll create three new features using the provided operators:

1. Interaction between Credit Score and Income: Since credit score and income are critical for credit decisions, exploring their interaction might provide additional insights.
   - Feature: Log of the product of Credit Score and Income
   - RPN: CreditScore Income multiply log

2. Employment and Debt Interaction: People who are employed might handle debt differently than those who are not. This interaction can be crucial for predicting credit outcomes.
   - Feature: Employment status multiplied by Debt
   - RPN: Employed Debt multiply

3. Industry Influence on Income: Different industries might have different average incomes. This feature captures the difference between a person's scaled income and the median scaled income of that industry.
   - Feature: Create industry-level median income and then subtract from individual's scaled income.
   - RPN: Industry Income groupbythenmedian Income subtract

Putting these together, the RPN expressions for the new features are:

plaintext
[CreditScore Income multiply log, Employed Debt multiply, Industry Income groupbythenmedian Income subtract]


These features aim to capture:
- The interaction between financial capability (credit score and income).
- The potential difference in financial behavior (employment status and debt).
- Industry-specific income deviations, which can influence creditworthiness perceptions.

2025-08-30 12:18:57,293 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features that could potentially improve the prediction model:

1. Debt-to-Income Ratio: This feature calculates the ratio of a person's debt to their income, providing an indication of their debt burden relative to their earning capacity.

   RPN: [Debt Income ratio]

   Reasoning: A higher debt-to-income ratio might indicate financial stress and could be an important factor in predicting credit card application success.

2. Employment Stability Score: This feature combines years employed and employment status to assess employment stability, taking into account whether the person is currently employed or not.

   RPN: [YearsEmployed Employed multiply]

   Reasoning: More years of employment paired with being currently employed may suggest a stable income source, which could positively influence credit card approval decisions.

3. Age and Credit Score Interaction: This feature captures the interaction between a person's age and their credit score, which might indicate their financial maturity and creditworthiness over time.

   RPN: [Age CreditScore multiply]

   Reasoning: Older individuals with higher credit scores might be more creditworthy due to their financial experience and history, which may impact credit card application success.

The selection of these new features aims to incorporate financial stability, employment status, and historical credit behavior into the model for better predictions.

2025-08-30 12:21:02,292 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance in predicting credit card application success, we can create new features that capture interactions or transformations of the existing features. Here’s the reasoning for choosing the following features:

1. Interaction between Employment Status and Income: 
   - Rationale: Employment status and income are likely to correlate with credit card application success. Employed individuals with higher incomes may be more likely to succeed in their applications.
   - Transformation: We can create a feature by multiplying the Employed status with Income.

2. Credit Score and Prior Default Interaction:
   - Rationale: A person's credit score and their history of prior defaults provide important information about their financial reliability. Combined, these features can offer a deeper insight.
   - Transformation: Create a feature that multiplies CreditScore by the inverse of PriorDefault (to give more weight to those with no prior defaults).

3. Marital Status and Income Stability:
   - Rationale: Married individuals might have more stable financial situations if dual incomes are present. Combining marital status with income (scaled) could provide insights into financial stability.
   - Transformation: Multiply the Married status with Income.

Here are the RPN expressions for creating these new features:

plaintext
[Employed Income multiply, CreditScore PriorDefault reciprocal multiply, Married Income multiply]
 

These transformations aim to create new dimensions that represent important aspects related to financial responsibility and capability, potentially improving model performance.

2025-08-30 12:23:11,259 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we'll engineer three new features using the provided operators and features. Each new feature aims to capture potential non-linear relationships or interactions between existing features that may be relevant for predicting credit card application success.

1. Debt-to-Income Ratio: This feature captures the proportion of a person's debt relative to their income. It's a crucial financial metric commonly used in credit assessments.
   - RPN: Debt Income ratio

2. Credit Behavior Interaction: An interaction between PriorDefault and CreditScore could uncover non-linear effects of past defaults and credit scores on credit approval.
   - RPN: PriorDefault CreditScore multiply

3. Age and Employment Interaction: Older individuals with more years employed might have stable financial profiles, which could affect credit card application outcomes. By dividing Age by YearsEmployed, we capture the density of work experience against age.
   - RPN: Age YearsEmployed divide 

Thus, the corresponding RPN expressions for these engineered features are:
