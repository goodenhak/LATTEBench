2025-08-30 10:45:59,620 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task of predicting credit card application success and the provided features, I'll create 3 new features that capture meaningful relationships and patterns:

1. Income-to-Debt Ratio: This measures financial stability - applicants with higher income relative to debt are more likely to be approved.
   Reasoning: Lenders evaluate debt-to-income ratios when assessing creditworthiness. A higher ratio indicates better ability to handle additional credit.

2. Employment Stability Score: Combines employment status with years employed to create a comprehensive employment stability measure.
   Reasoning: Stable employment history is a strong positive factor in credit decisions. This feature weights employment duration by current employment status.

3. Credit History Quality: Evaluates credit behavior by considering credit score in context of prior defaults.
   Reasoning: A good credit score despite prior defaults shows recovery, while a poor score with defaults indicates persistent issues.

2025-08-30 10:51:00,889 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task of predicting credit card application success and the provided features, I'll create 3 new features that capture meaningful relationships and patterns in the data:

1. Income-to-Debt Ratio: This measures financial stability - applicants with higher income relative to debt are more likely to be approved.
   Reasoning: Lenders prefer applicants with strong debt servicing capacity.

2. Employment Stability Score: Combines years employed with employment status to create a comprehensive employment stability metric.
   Reasoning: Stable employment history is a key factor in creditworthiness assessment.

3. Credit Profile Strength: Integrates credit score, default history, and bank customer status to create a holistic credit profile.
   Reasoning: Multiple credit-related factors together provide better predictive power than individual features.

2025-08-30 10:54:48,057 - INFO - LLM Output: [Age YearsEmployed plus log, YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore plus, Income Debt divide log]

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed plus log: Combining age and years employed (total work experience) could be a strong predictor of creditworthiness. Older individuals with more work experience are generally more financially stable. Taking the log helps normalize the distribution and handle outliers.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore plus: This creates a feature that amplifies credit score for employed individuals with longer tenure. The product of employment status and years employed creates a meaningful employment metric, which when added to credit score provides a composite financial stability indicator.

3. Income Debt divide log: The debt-to-income ratio is a fundamental metric in credit assessment. A lower ratio indicates better ability to handle additional debt. Taking the log helps handle the extreme values in income and debt distributions while preserving the ratio's predictive power.

These features capture important financial relationships:
- Total life experience (age + employment years)
- Employment quality weighted creditworthiness
- Debt burden relative to income capacity

All operations use numerical features appropriately and avoid mathematical operations on categorical data. The log transformations help address the skewed distributions observed in the data (particularly Income, YearsEmployed, and CreditScore).

2025-08-30 10:57:15,436 - INFO - LLM Output: [Age YearsEmployed multiply log, Income Debt divide log CreditScore multiply, Employed PriorDefault multiply CreditScore subtract abs]

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed multiply log - This creates a feature that captures the interaction between age and employment duration, which are both important factors in creditworthiness assessment. The log transformation helps normalize the distribution and handle outliers.

2. Income Debt divide log CreditScore multiply - This combines income-to-debt ratio (a key financial health indicator) with credit score, creating a powerful composite feature that captures both current financial capacity and historical credit behavior.

3. Employed PriorDefault multiply CreditScore subtract abs - This creates a feature that highlights the interaction between employment status and prior defaults, then contrasts it with credit score. The absolute value ensures we capture the magnitude of deviation, which could be predictive of credit card application success.

These features leverage meaningful interactions between fundamental financial indicators (income, debt, employment), credit history (defaults, credit score), and demographic factors (age, employment duration) that are known to be important in credit risk assessment.
