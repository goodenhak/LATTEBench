nO nX 1 plus divide,
Me nO multiply,
nX 4 bin target_encoding
}

Reasoning:
1. nO nX 1 plus divide computes the ratio of oxygen atoms to halogen atoms adjusted by adding 1 to avoid division by zero. This ratio is important because halogen atoms tend to reduce biodegradability, while oxygen atoms often promote it. Capturing this balance can help distinguish between biodegradable and non-biodegradable chemicals.

2. Me nO multiply combines the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity with the number of oxygen atoms. Electronegativity influences the reactivity of oxygen-containing functional groups, and this interaction may enhance the model's ability to predict biodegradability based on electronic properties.

3. nX 4 bin target_encoding creates a target encoding feature by first binning the number of halogen atoms into 4 categories (to handle the skewed distribution) and then encoding the mean target value for each bin. This directly captures the relationship between halogen count and biodegradability, providing a powerful predictive feature.

2025-08-31 05:19:39,249 - INFO - LLM Output: {Me Mi subtract, nO Me Me divide plus log, nCb- nO multiply}

Reasoning:  
1. Me Mi subtract: The difference between mean electronegativity (Me) and mean ionization potential (Mi) may capture electronic properties that influence biodegradability, as these factors affect molecular reactivity and interaction with biological systems.  
2. nO Me Me divide plus log: This computes log(1 + nO), which transforms the oxygen count to reduce skewness and handle zeros, making the distribution more normal and potentially improving model performance.  
3. nCb- nO multiply: This interaction term between aromatic carbon (nCb-) and oxygen (nO) may identify compounds where aromatic rings combined with oxygen-containing groups affect biodegradability due to enhanced or reduced degradation pathways.
