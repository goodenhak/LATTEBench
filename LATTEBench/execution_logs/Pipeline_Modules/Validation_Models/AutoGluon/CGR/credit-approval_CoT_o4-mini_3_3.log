2025-08-31 07:51:10,121 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features (in RPN) with their motivations:

1) Ethnicity PriorDefault groupbythenmean  
   – Captures each ethnicity’s average historical default rate, giving the model prior‐default priors by group.

2) YearsEmployed Age divide  
   – Measures job tenure relative to age (career stability), distinguishing long‐term workers from new entrants.

3) Gender Married cross label_encode  
   – Encodes the interaction between gender and marital status (e.g. single women vs. married men) as a single numeric feature.

Output:
{Ethnicity PriorDefault groupbythenmean, YearsEmployed Age divide, Gender Married cross label_encode}

2025-08-31 07:57:59,797 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features designed to capture non‐linear interactions, normalize individual behavior against peer groups, and encode joint categorical effects:

1. Interaction of credit score and debt‐to‐income (with log transform)  
   • Captures how creditworthiness moderates the impact of debt burden on approval odds  
2. Relative debt‐to‐income vs. industry average  
   • Normalizes an individual’s leverage against peers in the same sector  
3. Joint category of Ethnicity × Industry, label-encoded  
   • Allows the model to learn fine‐grained demographic‐sector effects
