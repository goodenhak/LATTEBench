Reasoning:
1. Age Debt divide log: This creates a log-debt-to-age ratio, which captures the burden of debt relative to life stage. Younger people with high debt may be riskier.
2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: This interaction term emphasizes employment duration only for currently employed individuals, which is a strong signal of stability.
3. CreditScore Debt subtract abs: The absolute difference between credit score and debt highlights mismatches - high debt with low credit score is particularly risky.
4. Income Debt divide log: This log-income-to-debt ratio measures repayment capacity, a key factor in credit decisions.
5. Age Income multiply sqrt: This combines age and income non-linearly, capturing life stage earning potential (sqrt handles the high income range).
6. PriorDefault Employed multiply negate: This creates a negative interaction where prior default is penalized more severely for employed individuals (who should have better means to avoid default).

These features capture:
- Debt burden relative to age/income
- Employment stability signals
- Credit-debt mismatches
- Non-linear combinations of key financial variables
- Interactive effects between risk factors

The log transformations handle skewed distributions (Debt, Income), while sqrt and abs manage scale and directionality. The interactions (multiply) capture conditional relationships that single features miss.

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt divide log: This creates a debt-to-age ratio on a logarithmic scale, which normalizes the distribution and captures the relative debt burden at different life stages. Younger individuals with high debt may be riskier than older individuals with similar absolute debt.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: This interaction term combines employment status with years employed. Being employed with many years of experience indicates stability, while being unemployed with many years employed might indicate recent job loss - both meaningful signals for creditworthiness.

3. CreditScore Debt subtract abs: This measures the absolute discrepancy between credit score and debt level. A high credit score with low debt is ideal, while low credit score with high debt is problematic. The absolute difference captures this risk mismatch.

4. Age_Debt_ratio_log YearsEmployed_Employed_multiply CreditScore_Debt_subtract_abs concat 3 bin: This bins the concatenation of three engineered features into 3 categories, creating a composite risk profile that captures multiple dimensions of creditworthiness (debt burden, employment stability, and credit-debt alignment) in a single categorical feature that can be effectively used in models.

Based on the provided features and the task of predicting credit card application success, here are 3 new engineered features with explanations:

1. Income Stability Score: This combines income, employment status, and years employed to create a measure of financial stability. Long employment with good income suggests stability.
   Income Employed multiply YearsEmployed multiply

2. Creditworthiness Index: This combines credit score, debt, and prior defaults to create a comprehensive credit risk assessment. Higher credit score with lower debt and no defaults indicates better creditworthiness.
   CreditScore Debt subtract PriorDefault negate plus

3. Debt-to-Income Age Adjusted: This improves upon the simple debt-to-income ratio by factoring in age, as older applicants might be expected to have higher income and better debt management skills.
   Debt Income ratio Age multiply

Based on the provided features and the goal of predicting credit card application success, here are 3 new engineered features with reasoning:

1. Income stability indicator: People with stable employment and consistent income are more likely to be approved for credit. This feature combines employment duration with income level.
   - Reasoning: Longer employment with higher income suggests financial stability
   - RPN: [YearsEmployed Income multiply log]

2. Creditworthiness score: Combines credit score with debt-to-income ratio to create a comprehensive creditworthiness metric.
   - Reasoning: High credit score with low debt-to-income ratio indicates good credit management
   - RPN: [CreditScore Debt_Income_ratio reciprocal multiply]

3. Financial responsibility indicator: Evaluates multiple aspects of financial responsibility including bank relationships, employment status, and credit history.
   - Reasoning: Bank customers with employment and no prior defaults are more likely to be approved
   - RPN: [BankCustomer Employed PriorDefault negate multiply plus plus]

[YearsEmployed Income multiply log, CreditScore Debt_Income_ratio reciprocal multiply, BankCustomer Employed PriorDefault negate multiply plus plus]

Based on the provided features and the goal of predicting credit card application success, I'll create 3 new features that capture meaningful relationships and interactions:

1. Income stability indicator: Income YearsEmployed multiply log
   - Reasoning: This combines income level with employment duration to create a stability metric. Higher values indicate both good income and long-term employment, which are positive factors for credit approval. The log transformation helps handle the skewed distribution of income.

2. Credit utilization efficiency: CreditScore Debt divide reciprocal
   - Reasoning: This measures how effectively debt is managed relative to credit score. A high value indicates good credit management (high credit score relative to debt), which should be positively correlated with approval success. The reciprocal ensures higher values represent better performance.

3. Default risk profile: PriorDefault Employed multiply negate Age multiply
   - Reasoning: This creates a composite risk score that considers both default history and employment status, weighted by age. Older applicants with no defaults and employment get higher scores. The negate operation flips the default-employment product to make positive values represent lower risk.

[Income YearsEmployed multiply log, CreditScore Debt divide reciprocal, PriorDefault Employed multiply negate Age multiply]

2025-08-30 11:41:17,862 - INFO - LLM Output: [Age YearsEmployed plus log, Debt Income ratio log, Employed PriorDefault multiply negate CreditScore plus]

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed plus log - This creates a feature that captures the combined effect of age and employment experience on a logarithmic scale, which may better represent the relationship between these two important factors for creditworthiness assessment.

2. Debt Income ratio log - The Debt_Income_ratio feature has an extremely wide range (0 to 19,000,000) with high variance. Taking the log will help normalize this distribution and make it more suitable for modeling, as the raw ratio values are heavily skewed.

3. Employed PriorDefault multiply negate CreditScore plus - This creates an interaction feature that combines employment status, prior defaults, and credit score. The negate operation on the employment-default interaction (where employed=1 and default=1 gives a negative signal) is then combined with credit score to create a comprehensive risk assessment feature that captures multiple dimensions of creditworthiness simultaneously.

These features were designed to:
- Normalize highly skewed distributions (log transformation)
- Create meaningful interactions between employment history, credit history, and financial metrics
- Capture non-linear relationships that might be important for predicting credit card application success
- Provide more stable and interpretable features for the downstream model

2025-08-30 11:44:49,134 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the features and the task of predicting credit card application success, I'll create 3 new features that capture important financial relationships and behavioral patterns:

1. Income-to-Debt Stability Ratio: This combines income, debt, and employment status to measure financial stability - a key factor in credit decisions.
   Reasoning: Lenders want to see that applicants have sufficient income relative to their debt obligations and stable employment.

2. Credit History Composite: This creates a comprehensive credit profile by combining credit score, prior defaults, and banking relationship.
   Reasoning: Creditworthiness is determined by multiple factors including credit history, banking relationships, and past payment behavior.

3. Age-Experience Interaction: This captures the interaction between age and employment experience, which indicates financial maturity.
   Reasoning: Older applicants with more work experience are generally viewed as more financially stable and reliable.

[Income Debt divide Employed multiply, CreditScore PriorDefault subtract BankCustomer multiply, Age YearsEmployed multiply]
