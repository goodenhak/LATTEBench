Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration divide: Creates a monthly burden ratio. Higher values indicate larger payments relative to loan duration, which may correlate with higher risk. This captures interaction between two key numerical features.

2. checking_status target_encoding: Transforms the important categorical feature checking_status into a numerical value representing historical approval rates for each category. This preserves categorical information while making it digestible for numerical models.

3. employment label_encode age divide: Converts employment duration to numerical (assuming ordinal relationship), then creates an experience-to-age ratio. Younger applicants with longer employment might be more reliable than older applicants with shorter employment history.

Reasoning:
1. employment credit_amount groupbythenmean: Groups by employment status and calculates mean credit amount per category. Employment stability likely correlates with both income level and creditworthiness, and the average loan size per employment category may capture risk patterns not evident in individual features.

2. credit_amount age duration multiply divide: Creates a risk exposure ratio by dividing credit amount by (age*duration). This captures whether the loan represents a disproportionately large commitment relative to the applicant's life stage and repayment period, which could indicate higher default risk.

3. savings_status existing_credits groupbythenmax: Groups by savings status and finds the maximum number of existing credits per category. This reveals the worst-case debt burden for each savings category, potentially identifying risky combinations where poor savers have multiple existing loans.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount age divide: Creates a debt burden ratio relative to life stage. Younger applicants with high credit amounts may represent higher risk.
2. duration installment_commitment multiply: Captures interaction between loan duration and payment burden. Longer durations with high installments may indicate riskier loans.
3. existing_credits num_dependents multiply: Measures financial pressure through combined existing obligations and dependents. Higher values suggest greater repayment risk.

These features capture important financial ratios and multiplicative interactions that may help the model better assess repayment capacity and risk patterns beyond individual features.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply: Creates an interaction feature representing total financial exposure (amount × time) which may better capture risk than ratio features alone.
2. existing_credits num_dependents multiply: Combines debt burden with dependency count to create a composite financial pressure indicator.
3. employment housing concat target_encoding: Captures stability patterns by combining employment status with housing situation, which are both important indicators of financial reliability when considered together.

Reasoning:
1. Multiplying two target-encoded features (credit_history and savings/checking status) captures interaction effects between these important categorical groupings, potentially revealing non-linear patterns missed by individual encodings.

2. Applying log transformation to credit_amount/duration ratio normalizes the highly skewed distribution (seen in its wide range and high std), making it more suitable for linear models while preserving the meaningful financial relationship between loan amount and repayment period.

3. Creating a new feature combining credit amount, dependents, and age (with sigmoid normalization) captures family financial burden relative to income capacity, as dependents increase financial obligations while age correlates with earning potential. The sigmoid constrains values to [0,1] range for stability.
