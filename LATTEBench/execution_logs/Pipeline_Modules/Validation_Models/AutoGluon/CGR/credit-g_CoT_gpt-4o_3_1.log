2025-08-29 19:16:00,244 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features generated using the provided operators and features:

1. Credit Risk Feature:
   This feature combines both the duration and the credit amount, taking into account the credit history. The rationale is that longer durations and higher credit amounts, combined with a poor credit history, might indicate higher credit risk.
   - RPN: [duration credit_amount multiply credit_history label_encode multiply]

2. Savings and Employment Status Interaction:
   This feature explores the interaction between a person's savings status and employment. This can potentially capture the financial stability of the applicant, as longer employment tends to indicate more stability, whereas a higher amount of savings usually implies a better financial buffer.
   - RPN: [savings_status label_encode employment label_encode multiply]

3. Age and Housing Situation Interaction:
   This feature examines how the applicant's age correlates with their housing situation. Younger individuals might be more likely to rent, whereas older applicants might own property, which can be indicative of financial stability.
   - RPN: [age housing label_encode multiply]

These new features aim to capture more complex interactions between existing features that might help improve the model's ability to predict credit outcomes by highlighting differences in financial stability and risk-taking behaviors.

2025-08-29 19:17:27,127 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance in predicting credit approval, let's create three new features that could capture meaningful information from the existing data. Here’s a logical approach with explanations:

1. New Feature 1: Employment Duration Interaction with Credit History
   - We use the hypothesis that longer employment durations might influence the relationship between credit history and credit approval. Thus, we calculate a feature that explores the interaction or trend within these categories.
   - RPN: employment duration groupbythenmean

2. New Feature 2: Financial Stability Indicator
   - Combining checking_status, savings_status, and property_magnitude might provide a holistic view of financial stability. Cross-encoding these features can create categorical interaction levels that capture joint effects.
   - RPN: checking_status savings_status cross property_magnitude cross

3. New Feature 3: Age Normalized Credit Amount
   - Creating a feature that represents the credit amount normalized by age can present an insight similar to financial maturity or responsible borrowing. We use min-max scaling to normalize the credit amount concerning age.
   - RPN: credit_amount age divide credit_amount age minmax

Combining these features helps encapsulate information around financial behavior, stability, and individual maturity in a structured manner that can be beneficial for predictive modeling.

Here's the RPN for the newly created features:

[employment duration groupbythenmean, checking_status savings_status cross property_magnitude cross, credit_amount age divide credit_amount age minmax]

2025-08-29 19:18:31,543 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance in predicting whether a person receives a credit, I will focus on creating features that capture interactions between existing features and patterns that might not be apparent in the raw data. Here are three new features and the reasoning behind each:

1. Employment Duration Adjusted by Age:
   This feature can help capture the context of an individual's employment duration in relation to their age. It might be interesting to see if older individuals with longer employment histories are more creditworthy, which isn't directly obvious from the raw age and employment duration alone.

   RPN: [age employment_duration_groupbythenmean multiply age credit_amount_age_divide_credit_amount_age_minmax negate plus]

2. Credit History and Purpose Cross-Feature:
   Crossing the credit history and purpose could capture specific reasons for credit applications combined with past credit history. Certain combinations might be predictive of creditworthiness, such as existing paid credits for business purposes.

   RPN: [credit_history purpose cross credit_amount_age_divide_credit_amount_age_minmax label_encode]

3. Installment Commitment Ratio to Credit Amount:
   This feature assesses the installment burden relative to the credit amount, providing an insight into whether the individual's income can support the required payments efficiently. Such information is critical for evaluating their capacity to repay credit.

   RPN: [installment_commitment credit_amount divide sqrt]

These features aim to uncover more complex relationships that the downstream model can leverage for better predictions, and each targets different facets of the dataset elements.

2025-08-29 19:19:50,082 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features generated using Reverse Polish Notation, along with explanations for how they can potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Feature One: Credit Utilization
   - RPN: [credit_amount credit_amount_age_divide_credit_amount_age_minmax divide]
   - Explanation: This feature captures the proportion of the credit amount given the normalized relationship between credit amount and age. The intuition is to evaluate the borrower's credit utilization concerning normalized values, allowing the model to better understand financial management tendencies relative to age and credit amount.

2. Feature Two: Employment and Savings Interaction
   - RPN: [employment savings_status cross label_encode]
   - Explanation: By examining how employment status interacts with savings status, we gain insight into the borrower's financial stability. This feature will enable the model to recognize risk or security levels associated with different combinations of employment and savings patterns. Label encoding transforms this categorical cross into a numerical form suitable for modeling.

3. Feature Three: Housing and Property Interaction
   - RPN: [housing property_magnitude cross label_encode]
   - Explanation: This feature explores the interaction between housing status and property ownership. It can help the model identify strengths or risks linked to living conditions and asset ownership. Label encoding is used to numerically represent the varied combinations, enriching the input data with nuanced financial information about asset security.

These engineered features aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model by introducing more complex interactions and ratios that are not directly observable from the initial feature set.

2025-08-29 19:21:08,312 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the dataset provided, the goal is to enhance model performance for predicting whether a person receives credit. The existing features and their interactions offer a good basis for creating new features that might further capture the underlying patterns leading to better predictions. Here are three new feature suggestions:

1. Interaction between employment and duration scaled: Duration is a critical numerical feature representing the repayment timeline, and employment status indicates job stability. Combining these two could provide insight into the creditworthiness relative to job stability across different durations.
   - Formula: (encoded employment * duration)
   - Reasoning: People with stable employment over long durations might be more likely to receive credit. This feature captures the interaction between duration and employment status.
   - RPN: [employment label_encode duration multiply]

2. Credit amount relative to income commitment: This feature analyzes how the requested credit amount relates to the percentage of the disposable income committed to installments. A lower ratio might indicate a safer borrowing scenario.
   - Formula: credit_amount / installment_commitment
   - Reasoning: This provides a proportion of credit amount relative to income commitment, potentially indicating affordability or risk.
   - RPN: [credit_amount installment_commitment divide]

3. Credit history group details: Utilize credit history and savings status through categorical interaction and averaging. This helps determine average credit history-dependent savings status.
   - Formula: (credit_history savings_status groupbythenmean)
   - Reasoning: Identifying common saving status trends or behaviors associated with particular credit history types might highlight insights into future credit risk.
   - RPN: [credit_history savings_status groupbythenmean]

Output:
[employment label_encode duration multiply, credit_amount installment_commitment divide, credit_history savings_status groupbythenmean]

2025-08-29 19:23:24,363 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features in Reverse Polish Notation that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Cross Feature Interaction: 
   Create an interaction feature between purpose and credit_history. This could capture insights about how credit history impacts the reason for applying for credit.

   RPN: [purpose credit_history cross]

2. Credit Utilization Ratio: 
   This feature is the ratio of credit_amount to income. Given that installment_commitment is in terms of percentage of disposable income, we can approximate disposable income by manipulating installment commitment. This feature can reflect the credit utilization, which might impact credit approval.

   RPN: [credit_amount installment_commitment divide]

3. Age Group with Tenure Effect: 
   It could be insightful to see if tenure (residence_since) influences credit approval when factored by age groupings. This feature bins age and modifies it with how long they have maintained their current residence.

   RPN: [age 5 bin residence_since plus]

Explanation:
1. Cross Feature Interaction: By creating an interaction between purpose and credit_history, we explore whether specific credit histories are more acceptable when considering the purpose of the credit. This type of feature can often unveil non-linear relationships or interactions not obvious from individual features alone.

2. Credit Utilization Ratio: The ratio of credit_amount to an approximation of disposable income (via installment_commitment) can be a strong indicator of financial health or risk. High credit utilization usually suggests a higher risk of default in credit scoring.

3. Age Group with Tenure Effect: Experiences and financial habits vary substantially across different age groups. Adding residence_since helps to capture stability in living conditions, which is often a factor in credit risk assessments. By binning age and adding residence duration, we can capture an age-adjusted metric of stability.

2025-08-29 19:24:43,549 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new feature engineering ideas to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Credit Intensity Ratio: This feature is designed to capture the ratio of the credit amount against the duration in months. It is useful to understand how concentrated the credit request is over time. A higher value might indicate a higher monthly financial burden.

   RPN: [credit_amount duration divide]

2. Savings and Checking Status Interaction with Credit History: This cross feature could provide insight into how certain combinations of savings and checking account status relate to credit history. This interaction might reveal underlying patterns not captured by individual features.

   RPN: [savings_status checking_status cross credit_history cross]

3. Age and Employment Stability Index: By combining age and employment duration, this feature aims to capture the stability or experience an individual has. The intuition is that older individuals with longer employment histories may be more stable or reliable borrowers.

   RPN: [age employment label_encode multiply]

Explanation:
1. The Credit Intensity Ratio could potentially highlight individuals requesting high credit amounts over shorter durations, which may be perceived as riskier compared to lower amounts over the same period.
   
2. Savings and Checking Status Interaction with Credit History helps to cluster individuals with similar financial behaviors or risk levels, considering their financial reserves and past credit history.
   
3. Age and Employment Stability Index combines age and employment information to evaluate overall maturity and financial stability, which is important in assessing creditworthiness.

2025-08-29 19:26:04,779 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new feature engineering RPN expressions designed to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. The first feature leverages the interaction between employment and current property status, as stability in job and property ownership could indicate better financial management.
   - Feature: Interaction between employment and property_magnitude.
   - RPN: [employment property_magnitude cross label_encode]

2. The second feature analyzes the ratio of credit amount to the duration, which might reflect the borrower's risk profile. A higher ratio could indicate higher risk.
   - Feature: Credit amount to duration ratio.
   - RPN: [credit_amount duration divide]

3. The third feature combines multiple stability factors such as checking status, savings status, and housing situation. The idea is to capture a comprehensive stability profile.
   - Feature: Interaction between checking_status, savings_status, and housing.
   - RPN: [checking_status savings_status housing cross label_encode]

These features are intended to capture interactions and relationships that may be indicative of creditworthiness, thereby potentially boosting the predictive accuracy of the model.

2025-08-29 19:27:55,478 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance for predicting whether a person receives credit, we will create three new features using feature engineering. Our goal is to explore both individual potential predictors and interactions between existing features, informed by the relationships seen in the provided data examples and statistical characteristics. 

1. Interaction Between Checking Status, Savings Status, and Credit History: We will capture the interaction between these categories, which might provide insights into financial behavior influencing credit decisions.

   RPN: checking_status savings_status credit_history cross

2. Scale the Credit Amount Relative to Disposable Income: The ratio of credit amount to installment commitment provides information on the proportion of a person's income being required to cover the credit, potentially reflecting ability to manage loan payments.

   RPN: credit_amount installment_commitment divide

3. Age Influence on Employment Duration: Capturing how age interacts with employment duration can show maturity and stability level, potentially influencing creditworthiness.

   RPN: age employment_duration_groupbythenmean divide

Output:
[checking_status savings_status credit_history cross, credit_amount installment_commitment divide, age employment_duration_groupbythenmean divide]
