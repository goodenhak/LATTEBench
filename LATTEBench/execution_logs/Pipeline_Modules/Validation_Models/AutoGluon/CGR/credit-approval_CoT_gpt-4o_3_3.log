2025-08-30 12:25:39,143 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the prediction of credit card application success, we can create new features using feature engineering. Here are three potential new features with explanations:

1. Debt-to-Income Ratio: This feature assesses the proportion of an individual's income that goes towards debt. It can be a strong indicator of financial health. People with a high debt-to-income ratio might be less likely to successfully apply for a credit card.
   - RPN: [Debt Income divide]

2. Years Employed Influence: By scaling the years employed to the log scale, we can emphasize recent changes in employment. This might capture the effect of job stability on credit card application success more prominently.
   - RPN: [YearsEmployed log]

3. Interaction between Communication Skills and Experience: This feature captures the combined effect of employment status (indicating active participation in the workforce) and CreditScore (reflective of trustworthiness). A person who's employed and has a good credit score might have a higher chance of credit card approval.
   - RPN: [Employed CreditScore multiply]

Using these engineered features, we aim to capture different aspects of a person's financial and employment situation, potentially leading to better model performance in predicting credit card application success.

1. Debt-to-Income Ratio Rank:
   Understanding the proportion of debt relative to income is crucial for credit applications. Using rank can highlight relative positions rather than exact values, which may be helpful for the model.
   - RPN Expression: [Debt Income ratio rank]

2. Employment Stability Cross-Categorical Feature:
   Combining employment status with years employed using a categorical cross can capture how long individuals typically stay employed when they are working or not.
   - RPN Expression: [Employed YearsEmployed cross]

3. Ethnicity-Citizenship Interaction (Categorical):
   By combining ethnicity with citizenship, we may capture underlying social or demographic patterns that could affect credit card application success.
   - RPN Expression: [Ethnicity Citizen cross]

These transformations aim to uncover relationships that are not directly apparent with the raw features, potentially enhancing the model's ability to predict credit card application success.

   - Reasoning: By calculating the ratio of Debt to CreditScore, we gain an understanding of how an individual's debt load compares to their creditworthiness. This can be an important indicator of financial health and likelihood of credit approval.

2. Feature 2: Employment Security
   - RPN: [YearsEmployed Employed multiply]
   - Reasoning: This feature multiplies the binary employment status by years employed, giving higher weight to individuals who are both employed and have longer employment history. This can be indicative of job stability and income reliability, which affect credit card approval.

3. Feature 3: Age and Credit Interactions
   - RPN: [Age CreditScore multiply]
   - Reasoning: The interaction between age and credit score can provide insights into how age correlates with creditworthiness. Older individuals with high credit scores might be more likely to be seen as responsible borrowers, affecting their credit card application success.

Output in RPN format:
[Debt CreditScore divide, YearsEmployed Employed multiply, Age CreditScore multiply]

2025-08-30 12:30:16,794 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the performance of the downstream model predicting successful credit card applications, we need to generate features that might better capture interactions or important characteristics that aren't directly evident in the original set of features. Considering the operators available, here are three proposed features and the reasoning behind their creation:

1. Debt-to-Income Ratio Interaction with Employment: Individuals with a better debt-to-income ratio might be better positioned to successfully apply for a credit card, especially if they're employed, as employment adds stability to these financial metrics. By scaling debt by income and then interacting it with employment status, we might capture this dynamic more effectively. 

   RPN: [Debt Income divide multiply Employed plus]

2. Scaled Credit Score with Banking Status: People with better credit scores likely have a higher chance of successful credit card applications, particularly if they are bank customers, as this status often complements a higher credit score. Using a sigmoid transformation on the credit score could better capture non-linear relationships, especially when coupled with banking status. 

   RPN: [CreditScore sigmoid BankCustomer multiply]

3. Industry-Specific Credit Behavior: Certain industries might inherently influence credit behavior differently, such as financials versus consumer staples. Applying target encoding to the 'Industry' feature based on successful applications can leverage historical trends within industries to better inform predictions.

   RPN: [Industry label_encode Answer Industry groupbythenmean]

These engineered features aim to capture nuanced interactions, statistical tendencies, and transformations that may better inform predictions regarding who successfully applies for a credit card.

2025-08-30 12:32:25,697 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the data provided, we can create new features that might help improve the performance of the model for predicting credit card application success. Here are three new features:

1. Debt to Income Ratio Log Transformation:
   - Often, the debt to income ratio is a significant factor in credit decisions. Applying a log transformation can stabilize variance and make the data more interpretable.
   - RPN: [Debt Income divide log]

2. Interaction between Employment and Industry:
   - Some industries may have particular characteristics that affect the likelihood of being employed, and being employed is a crucial factor for credit card approval. Creating an interaction between Employment status and Industry might capture this effect.
   - RPN: [Employed Industry cross]

3. Mean Credit Score by Ethnicity:
   - Ethnicity could influence the general credit score trends, potentially due to socio-economic factors. Calculating the mean credit score for each Ethnicity category could provide a useful feature that encapsulates this effect.
   - RPN: [Ethnicity CreditScore groupbythenmean]

These engineered features are designed to capture potentially non-linear relationships, categorical interactions, and summary statistics, which might not be directly visible in the original features.

2025-08-30 12:33:34,300 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance predictions for whether individuals in the dataset will be successful in applying for a credit card, let's create three new features using the provided operators and input features. The rationale is to capture relationships and transformations that might offer more insight into the probability of successful credit card applications.

1. Debt-to-Income-Citizenship Interaction: Given the feature 'Debt_Income_divide', which represents a form of debt-to-income ratio, and the 'Citizen' category, we can create an interaction term that might capture how debt relative to income impacts people differently based on citizenship status.
   - RPN: 
     
     Debt_Income_divide Citizen label_encode multiply
     

2. Employment-Stability Ratio: Employment status and years employed can capture employment stability. The interaction of years employed and employment status can provide an indicator of stability, which might be crucial for predicting successful credit card applications.
   - RPN:
     
     Employed YearsEmployed multiply
     

3. Age and Credit Maturity: Combining 'Age' with 'CreditScore', we create a feature that reflects the ability to manage credit over one's lifetime. This can help identify individuals who are likely to have a more mature approach to credit management.
   - RPN:
     
     Age CreditScore multiply
     

Thus, the final output, using Reverse Polish Notation, is:

[Debt_Income_divide Citizen label_encode multiply, Employed YearsEmployed multiply, Age CreditScore multiply]

2025-08-30 12:34:52,866 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that can potentially improve the prediction of credit card application success, we consider enhancing or transforming existing features through a combination of operators. Here are three features with their reasoning:

1. Debt-To-Income Ratio Transformation: 
   - The Debt_Income_divide feature represents the ratio of debt to income, which is an important indicator of financial health. Applying the logarithmic transformation can help manage skewness and stabilize variance, making it easier for the model to learn from this feature.
   - RPN: Debt_Income_divide log

2. Employment and Income Interaction: 
   - Individuals who are employed and have a higher income might have more favorable credit profiles. By multiplying the Employed status by the scaled Income, we create a feature that emphasizes this interaction.
   - RPN: Employed Income multiply

3. Prior Default Impact on Credit Score: 
   - This feature captures the interaction between having a prior default (PriorDefault) and its impact on the scaled CreditScore. It helps understand whether individuals with prior defaults have altered credit scores.
   - Using the multiply operator blends PriorDefault with CreditScore to assess its combined effect.
   - RPN: PriorDefault CreditScore multiply

Output in RPN notation:
[Debt_Income_divide log, Employed Income multiply, PriorDefault CreditScore multiply]

1. Debt-to-Income Ratio Sqrt: A high debt-to-income ratio indicates financial stress, which can affect credit card application outcomes. Applying a square root transformation can stabilize variance and reduce the effect of extreme ratios. 

   RPN: Debt_Income_divide sqrt

2. Years Employed Ratio: The ratio of years employed to a person's age can give insight into their work stability and experience relative to their age. This could be indicative of financial responsibility and stability.

   RPN: YearsEmployed Age divide

3. Credit Score and Employment Status Interaction: The interaction between credit score and employment status may reveal nuanced information about financial stability. This feature can help capture differences in application success among employed vs. non-employed individuals with similar credit scores.

   RPN: CreditScore Employed multiply

By employing these feature transformations, we aim to improve model interpretability and predictive performance by capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between the features.

2025-08-30 12:39:08,713 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the prediction task of determining credit card application success, we'll create three new features using the provided operators. We'll focus on capturing complex relationships or transformations that might add predictive power.

1. Feature: Employment Stability
   - RPN: YearsEmployed Citizen label_encode Employed multiply plus
   - Explanation: This feature combines the number of years a person has been employed with their citizenship status (a numerical encoding of citizenship type) and employment status. It aims to capture the stability and reliability of the applicant's employment, considering both experience and legal standing.

2. Feature: Risk Score Adjustment
   - RPN: CreditScore Age multiply PriorDefault negate multiply plus
   - Explanation: By combing the Credit Score with Age and adjusting it for Prior Defaults, we create a new risk score that accounts for the applicant's creditworthiness, maturity, and history of defaulting. The score is reduced (hence the negate) if there are prior defaults, indicating higher risk.

3. Feature: Debt Burden Categorization
   - RPN: Debt_Income_divide 5 bin
   - Explanation: This feature categorizes the debt-to-income ratio into bins. By converting this complex ratio into categories, we simplify the feature, potentially making patterns in the data more apparent to models. This helps in understanding different levels of financial burden relative to income.

Output in Reverse Polish Notation:

[YearsEmployed Citizen label_encode Employed multiply plus, CreditScore Age multiply PriorDefault negate multiply plus, Debt_Income_divide 5 bin]

2025-08-30 12:41:24,642 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the prediction model's performance, we'll create new features that capture potentially valuable information from the existing feature set. 

1. Feature 1: Income Stability Indicator
   - Explanation: People with stable and higher incomes are more likely to be successful in credit card applications. We'll try to capture this by calculating a new feature based on Income and YearsEmployed to indicate potential income stability.
   - RPN: [Income YearsEmployed multiply sqrt]

2. Feature 2: Debt to Income with Prior Default Impact
   - Explanation: Debt-to-income ratio is a critical factor in credit applications, and having a prior default could significantly influence the application outcome. This feature attempts to incorporate both aspects.
   - RPN: [Debt Income divide PriorDefault multiply]

3. Feature 3: Age and Employment Interaction with Credit Score
   - Explanation: A combination of age, being employed, and credit score could be a strong indicator of creditworthiness. An employed individual with a good credit score at a younger age might be viewed positively for credit applications.
   - RPN: [Age Employed multiply CreditScore multiply]

Thus, the final RPN output is:
