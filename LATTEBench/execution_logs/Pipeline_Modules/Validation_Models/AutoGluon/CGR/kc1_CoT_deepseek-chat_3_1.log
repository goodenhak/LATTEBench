2025-08-29 23:09:08,985 - INFO - LLM Output: [loc v multiply log, branchCount loc divide, v e multiply sqrt]

Reasoning:
1. loc v multiply log: This combines code size (loc) with complexity (v, Halstead volume) in a multiplicative way. Larger modules with higher complexity are more likely to have defects. The log transformation helps handle the right-skewed distributions of both features while preserving the multiplicative relationship.

2. branchCount loc divide: This creates a density measure of control flow complexity relative to code size. A high branch count in a small module indicates concentrated complexity, which is often associated with higher defect probability. This ratio helps normalize branchCount by module size.

3. v e multiply sqrt: This combines Halstead volume (v) with effort (e) - two measures of software complexity that are conceptually related. Multiplying them amplifies the signal for extremely complex modules, while the square root transformation compresses the scale to make the feature more normally distributed and less sensitive to extreme outliers.

These features capture:
- Size-complexity interactions (loc * v)
- Complexity density (branchCount/loc)
- Compound complexity measures (v * e)
All use appropriate transformations (log, sqrt) to handle the heavy-tailed distributions common in software metrics data.

2025-08-29 23:10:38,296 - INFO - LLM Output: [loc v multiply log, branchCount loc divide, v e multiply sqrt]

Reasoning:
1. loc v multiply log: This combines McCabe's line count (loc) with cyclomatic complexity (v) through multiplication, then applies a log transform. Cyclomatic complexity measures code complexity, and when multiplied by lines of code, it gives a measure of overall complexity density. The log transform helps handle the skewed distribution and makes the feature more normally distributed, which is beneficial for many ML models.

2. branchCount loc divide: This calculates the ratio of branch count to lines of code. Branch count represents decision points in the code, and normalizing it by loc gives a measure of decision density. Modules with higher decision density per line are likely more complex and prone to defects. This ratio captures this normalized complexity.

3. v e multiply sqrt: This multiplies cyclomatic complexity (v) by Halstead effort (e), then applies a square root transform. Cyclomatic complexity measures structural complexity, while Halstead effort measures the mental effort required to implement the algorithm. Their product represents overall code complexity and development difficulty. The square root transform helps reduce the extreme skewness in the effort metric while preserving the relationship.

These features combine complementary aspects of code complexity (McCabe and Halstead metrics) in normalized ways that capture both structural and cognitive complexity dimensions, which are known to correlate with software defects. The transformations (log and sqrt) help handle the heavy-tailed distributions commonly found in software metrics data.

2025-08-29 23:12:06,840 - INFO - LLM Output: [loc v(g) multiply log, branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply, e sqrt v multiply]

Reasoning:
1. loc v(g) multiply log: This creates an interaction feature between code size (loc) and complexity (v(g)), then applies log scaling. Both loc and cyclomatic complexity are strong indicators of defect proneness. Multiplying them captures their synergistic effect, and log scaling helps handle the heavy-tailed distributions commonly seen in software metrics.

2. branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply: This creates a normalized complexity measure. It first calculates branch density (branchCount/loc) to measure control flow complexity per line of code, then multiplies by cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) to amplify the effect of complex decision structures. This helps identify modules with both high structural complexity and dense control flow.

3. e sqrt v multiply: This combines Halstead's effort (e) and volume (v) metrics in a non-linear way. Taking the square root of effort helps normalize its extreme distribution while preserving the ordering, then multiplying by volume creates a composite measure of software complexity that captures both the cognitive effort and program size aspects that contribute to defect introduction.

These features were designed to:
- Capture interactions between different complexity dimensions
- Normalize extreme value distributions common in software metrics
- Create meaningful composite indicators that go beyond simple linear combinations
- Focus on metrics known to be associated with software quality (complexity, size, effort)
- Handle the heavy-tailed distributions through appropriate transformations

2025-08-29 23:13:35,056 - INFO - LLM Output: [loc v(g) multiply log, branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply, e v multiply sqrt reciprocal]

Reasoning:

1. loc v(g) multiply log: This captures the interaction between code size (loc) and complexity (v(g)) in a log-transformed way. Larger, more complex modules are more likely to have defects, but the relationship is often non-linear. The log transform helps handle the right-skewed distributions of both features.

2. branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply: This creates a feature representing complexity density - how much branching complexity exists per line of code, weighted by overall cyclomatic complexity. High values indicate modules that are both complex and dense with control flow, which are strong indicators of defect-prone code.

3. e v multiply sqrt reciprocal: This creates an inverse measure of code efficiency - Halstead's effort (e) multiplied by volume (v) represents the squared effort, and taking the reciprocal of its square root gives us 1/sqrt(e*v). Lower values of this feature (higher original effort*volume) should correlate with more defect-prone code, as inefficient code with high computational complexity tends to have more defects.

These features capture important non-linear interactions between size, complexity, and efficiency metrics that are known to be predictive of software defects, while using appropriate transformations to handle the skewed distributions typical of code metrics.

2025-08-29 23:16:40,268 - INFO - LLM Output: [loc v(g) multiply log, branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply, e sqrt v multiply]

Reasoning:
1. loc v(g) multiply log: This combines two fundamental code metrics (size and complexity) multiplicatively, then applies log to handle the heavy-tailed distribution. The interaction between size and complexity is often predictive of defects, as larger and more complex modules tend to be more error-prone.

2. branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply: This creates a normalized complexity measure by dividing branchCount by loc (giving branching density), then multiplies by cyclomatic complexity. This captures the interaction between control flow complexity and module size, which can indicate modules that are both large and complex in their control flow - a known risk factor for defects.

3. e sqrt v multiply: This combines Halstead's effort (e) and volume (v) metrics with a square root transformation. The square root helps normalize the extremely right-skewed effort values while preserving the interaction with volume. This captures the relationship between software complexity (volume) and the estimated mental effort required, which correlates with defect introduction.

These features were chosen because they:
- Create meaningful interactions between established software metrics
- Apply appropriate transformations for skewed distributions
- Capture different aspects of software complexity that are known to correlate with defect proneness
- Provide complementary information to the existing features
- Maintain interpretability in the context of software engineering

2025-08-29 23:18:08,110 - INFO - LLM Output: [loc v(g) multiply log, v e multiply sqrt, branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply]

Reasoning:
1. loc v(g) multiply log: This combines code size (loc) and cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) which are both strong indicators of code complexity. Taking the log helps normalize the product which could have extreme values due to the right-skewed distributions of both features.

2. v e multiply sqrt: Halstead volume (v) and effort (e) are both measures of program complexity and development effort. Multiplying them creates an interaction term, and taking the square root helps reduce the extreme skewness while preserving the relationship.

3. branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply: This creates a normalized branching complexity measure - branch count relative to code size, then weighted by cyclomatic complexity. This captures the interaction between control flow complexity (branchCount), code size (loc), and structural complexity (v(g)).

These features were chosen because:
- They combine complementary metrics from both McCabe and Halstead suites
- They address the extreme skewness in the original features through appropriate transformations
- They create meaningful interactions between size, complexity, and control flow metrics
- They preserve interpretability while providing non-linear relationships
- They avoid division by zero issues (all denominators have reasonable minimum values)

2025-08-29 23:20:46,969 - INFO - LLM Output: [loc v(g) multiply log, loc branchCount divide v(g) multiply, e v multiply sqrt log]

Reasoning:
1. loc v(g) multiply log: This creates a feature that combines code size (loc) and complexity (v(g)) in a multiplicative way, then applies log to handle skew. Larger, more complex modules are more likely to have defects, and the log transformation helps normalize the distribution.

2. loc branchCount divide v(g) multiply: This creates a density-like metric that represents complexity per unit of code (branchCount/loc) multiplied by overall complexity (v(g)). Higher values indicate more complex control flow relative to code size, which is often associated with defect-prone code.

3. e v multiply sqrt log: This combines Halstead's effort (e) and volume (v) metrics, which both measure programming complexity. The square root helps reduce the extreme skew in these metrics, and the log further normalizes the distribution. This captures the relationship between computational complexity and defect proneness.

2025-08-29 23:25:13,005 - INFO - LLM Output: [loc v(g) multiply log, e v multiply sqrt, branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply]

Reasoning:
1. loc v(g) multiply log: This combines McCabe's line count and cyclomatic complexity, which are fundamental code complexity metrics. Multiplying them emphasizes modules with both high size and complexity, which are more prone to defects. Taking the log helps normalize the skewed distribution.

2. e v multiply sqrt: Halstead's effort (e) and volume (v) are key software metrics that measure programming effort. Multiplying them creates a compound metric that captures the interaction between these two important factors. The square root helps reduce the extreme skewness while preserving the relationship.

3. branchCount loc divide v(g) multiply: This creates a normalized complexity metric that relates branching complexity (branchCount) to code size (loc), then scales it by cyclomatic complexity (v(g)). This helps identify modules where the control flow complexity is high relative to the code size, which could indicate problematic code structures.

These features capture interactions between different types of complexity metrics (size, control flow, and Halstead characteristics) that are known to be associated with software defects, while also addressing the skewed distributions through appropriate transformations.
