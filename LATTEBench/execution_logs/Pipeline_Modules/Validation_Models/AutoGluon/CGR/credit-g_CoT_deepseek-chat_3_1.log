2025-08-29 18:15:51,096 - INFO - LLM Output: [credit_amount duration multiply log, checking_status credit_history cross, credit_amount age ratio, duration age multiply log, credit_amount installment_commitment multiply, savings_status employment cross, age existing_credits multiply, credit_amount duration divide, duration existing_credits multiply, age duration ratio]

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply log: This captures the interaction between loan amount and duration on a logarithmic scale, which often has better predictive power than linear relationships in credit scoring models.

2. checking_status credit_history cross: Combining these two important financial stability indicators creates powerful interaction terms that can reveal complex patterns (e.g., someone with good credit history but poor checking status might be riskier than expected).

3. credit_amount age ratio: This creates a normalized feature that represents the credit burden relative to life stage, as younger applicants with large loans might be riskier than older applicants with similar amounts.

4. duration age multiply log: Captures the interaction between loan duration and applicant age, which can indicate risk patterns (longer loans for older applicants might have different risk profiles).

5. credit_amount installment_commitment multiply: Combines loan size with repayment burden percentage, creating a feature that represents the absolute financial commitment.

6. savings_status employment cross: Crosses savings behavior with employment stability - two key indicators of financial health that together provide more nuanced risk assessment.

7. age existing_credits multiply: Older applicants with multiple existing credits might have different risk profiles than younger ones with similar credit counts.

8. credit_amount duration divide: Creates a monthly burden feature by dividing total credit amount by duration months.

9. duration existing_credits multiply: Longer duration loans combined with multiple existing credits might indicate higher risk of over-indebtedness.

10. age duration ratio: Normalizes loan duration by age, capturing whether the loan term is appropriate for the applicant's life stage.

These features were chosen to capture:
- Financial capacity interactions (amount vs income/duration)
- Cross-category interactions that reveal nuanced risk patterns
- Normalized ratios that provide better comparability across applicants
- Logarithmic transformations for better distribution properties
- Multiplicative terms that capture non-linear relationships

The features focus on combining the most predictive original features (checking_status, credit_history, duration, credit_amount) in ways that should improve model discrimination power while maintaining interpretability.

Based on the analysis of the existing features and engineered features, here are 3 new features that could improve predictive performance:

1. credit_amount installment_commitment ratio log: This captures the monthly burden of the credit relative to income commitment
   - Reasoning: Higher ratios indicate greater financial strain, which is predictive of default risk
   - RPN: credit_amount installment_commitment ratio log

2. age duration multiply: Interaction between age and loan duration
   - Reasoning: Younger applicants with longer durations may have different risk profiles than older applicants
   - RPN: age duration multiply

3. savings_status property_magnitude cross: Combined effect of savings and property ownership
   - Reasoning: The interaction between liquid assets (savings) and fixed assets (property) provides a more comprehensive view of financial stability
   - RPN: savings_status property_magnitude cross

Based on the analysis of the provided features and data examples, here are 3 new engineered features that could improve predictive performance:

1. [credit_amount duration multiply log reciprocal]
   Reasoning: The existing credit_amount_duration_multiply_log feature shows good discriminatory power (range 7.31-13.70), but taking its reciprocal could help identify cases where both credit amount and duration are extremely high (higher risk) or extremely low (lower risk). The reciprocal transformation can help normalize the distribution and highlight extreme values more effectively.

2. [age existing_credits multiply credit_amount divide]
   Reasoning: This creates a burden ratio that measures credit amount relative to the product of age and existing credits. Older applicants with more existing credits taking large loans might represent higher risk, while younger applicants with fewer credits taking smaller loans might be lower risk. This captures the interaction between age, existing debt burden, and loan size.

3. [savings_status property_magnitude cross]
   Reasoning: Cross-tabulating savings status with property magnitude could reveal important risk patterns. For example, applicants with no known savings and no known property likely represent the highest risk category, while those with >=1000 savings and real estate property represent the lowest risk. This categorical interaction could capture risk profiles that individual features might miss.

These new features complement the existing engineered features by:
- Adding reciprocal transformation to handle extreme values
- Creating a comprehensive burden ratio considering multiple risk factors
- Introducing a new categorical cross feature that combines financial stability indicators
- Maintaining interpretability while potentially capturing non-linear relationships

The features are designed to work well with tree-based models and could help the downstream classifier better distinguish between creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants.

Based on the analysis of the existing features and engineered features, here are 3 new features that could improve predictive performance:

1. [credit_amount duration multiply log existing_credits multiply log]
   - Reasoning: This creates a triple interaction term between credit amount, duration, and existing credits, then applies log transformation to handle skewness. The combination of these three fundamental financial factors (loan size, repayment period, and existing debt burden) likely has strong predictive power for credit risk assessment.

2. [checking_status credit_history cross savings_status cross]
   - Reasoning: This creates a three-way categorical interaction between checking status, credit history, and savings status. These three features represent different aspects of financial stability and history, and their combination may reveal more nuanced risk patterns than the existing two-way cross feature.

3. [age installment_commitment multiply credit_amount ratio]
   - Reasoning: This creates a feature that represents the ratio of credit amount to (age × installment commitment). This captures the relative burden of the loan payment commitment compared to the applicant's age and income allocation, which could be a strong indicator of repayment capacity.

These features were designed to:
- Capture higher-order interactions between key financial indicators
- Create more nuanced risk assessment metrics by combining multiple relevant factors
- Maintain interpretability while potentially improving predictive power
- Handle numerical skewness through appropriate transformations
- Leverage the most predictive existing features identified in the dataset
