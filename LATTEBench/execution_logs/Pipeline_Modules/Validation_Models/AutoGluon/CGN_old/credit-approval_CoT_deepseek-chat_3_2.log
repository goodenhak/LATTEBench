2025-08-16 14:23:25,095 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for predicting credit card application success:

1. <DebtToIncomeRatio><divide><Debt><Income><Ratio_of_debt_to_income_as_financial_stress_indicator>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of debt to income is a strong indicator of financial health. Even though both features are scaled, their ratio provides meaningful information about the applicant's ability to handle additional credit.

2. <EmployedYearsInteraction><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_experience>
   - Reasoning: This creates a feature that captures both current employment status and duration of employment. Applicants who are both currently employed and have longer employment history may be more creditworthy.

3. <CreditScoreAgeInteraction><cross><CreditScore><Age><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_age_as_maturity_measure>
   - Reasoning: Younger applicants with good credit scores might be treated differently than older applicants with similar scores. This cross feature captures non-linear relationships between these important factors.

These features were chosen because:
1. They combine financial indicators that lenders typically consider important
2. They create interaction terms that might reveal non-linear patterns
3. They maintain interpretability while potentially improving predictive power
4. They avoid problematic operations on categorical features
5. They leverage domain knowledge about creditworthiness factors

The debt-to-income ratio is particularly important as it's a standard metric used in credit decisions. The employment interaction term captures stability, and the credit score-age interaction accounts for life stage differences in credit behavior.

2025-08-16 14:25:40,282 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the credit card approval prediction model:

1. <DebtToIncomeRatio_log><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Log_transform_of_DebtToIncomeRatio_to_handle_extreme_skew>
   - Reasoning: The DebtToIncomeRatio has extreme outliers (max=17.75M) and a highly skewed distribution. A log transform can help normalize this feature while preserving its predictive power for financial stress.

2. <CreditScore_Employed_interaction><cross><CreditScore><Employed><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: The effect of credit score on approval likelihood may differ based on employment status. This interaction term can capture that relationship better than considering the features separately.

3. <IncomeDebtRatio><ratio><Income><Debt><Ratio_of_income_to_debt_as_financial_health_indicator>
   - Reasoning: The absolute values of Income and Debt may be less informative than their ratio, which directly measures ability to service debt. This is particularly relevant since both features are already scaled.

These transformations address key issues in the data:
1) Extreme skew in financial features
2) Potential interaction effects between important predictors
3) Creation of more interpretable financial health metrics

The log transform will make DebtToIncomeRatio more usable by models, the interaction term may reveal conditional relationships, and the ratio feature provides a more direct measure of financial capacity than either component alone.

2025-08-16 14:27:56,079 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance, along with their reasoning:

1. <IncomeDebtRatio_log><log><IncomeDebtRatio><Log_transform_of_IncomeDebtRatio_to_handle_extreme_skew>
   - Reasoning: The IncomeDebtRatio has extreme skew (range up to 1,000,000 with mean=3088 but median=2.53). A log transform would normalize this distribution, similar to how DebtToIncomeRatio_log was created from DebtToIncomeRatio. This helps linear models better handle the feature.

2. <CreditScore_sigmoid><sigmoid><CreditScore><Sigmoid_scaled_credit_score_to_bound_values_between_0_and_1>
   - Reasoning: CreditScore has a sparse distribution (median=0, Q3=2.75 but range up to 67). Applying sigmoid would compress extreme values while preserving ordinal relationships, making it more usable for models sensitive to feature scales.

3. <Employed_Married_interaction><cross><Employed><Married><Interaction_between_employment_and_marital_status_as_joint_indicator>
   - Reasoning: Employment and marital status are both binary flags that likely have interaction effects (e.g., employed+married might indicate more stability than either alone). A cross product creates explicit interaction terms that tree-based models might otherwise need multiple splits to discover.

These transformations address:
- Skewed numerical distributions (log transform)
- Extreme value scaling (sigmoid)
- Potential interaction effects (cross product)
Without creating features that would be redundant or violate operational constraints (e.g., no division of categoricals).

2025-08-16 14:30:15,506 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for credit card application success prediction:

1. <CreditScore_Age_Ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Age><Ratio_of_credit_score_to_age_to_capture_lifecycle_creditworthiness>  
Reasoning: Younger applicants with higher credit scores may be more responsible, while older applicants with low scores may be riskier. This ratio captures that relationship.

2. <Income_DebtRatio_bin><bin><IncomeDebtRatio><Binned_IncomeDebtRatio_to_handle_extreme_values_and_nonlinear_relationships>  
Reasoning: The raw IncomeDebtRatio has extreme skew (range up to 1,000,000). Binning will create robust categories that may have clearer relationships with approval rates.

3. <Employed_Married_Industry><cross><Employed_Married_interaction><Industry><Interaction_between_employment_marital_status_and_industry_sector>  
Reasoning: Certain industries may have different approval patterns for employed/unemployed and married/unmarried applicants. This 3-way interaction could reveal these nuanced patterns.

These features address:
1) Creating meaningful ratios between existing features
2) Handling extreme value distributions via binning 
3) Exploring higher-order interactions that may affect approval decisions

The first two maintain numerical interpretability while the third creates categorical interactions that may align with underwriting decision patterns. All three are computationally efficient to create.

2025-08-16 14:32:33,105 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve model performance for credit card approval prediction:

1. <CreditUtilizationRatio><divide><Debt><Income><Ratio_of_debt_to_income_to_measure_credit_utilization>
- Reasoning: This creates a direct measure of how much debt a person carries relative to their income, which is a key factor in creditworthiness assessments. The existing DebtToIncomeRatio appears to have extreme values (range up to 17.75M), so this alternative ratio using the scaled features may be more stable.

2. <YearsEmployed_sqrt><sqrt><YearsEmployed><Square_root_transform_of_years_employed_to_reduce_skew>
- Reasoning: The YearsEmployed feature is right-skewed (mean=2.016, max=28.5). Applying a square root transform can normalize the distribution and make the feature more useful for linear models while preserving the ordinal relationship.

3. <IndustryRiskScore><groupbythenmean><Industry><PriorDefault><Average_default_rate_by_industry_sector>
- Reasoning: This creates a target-encoded feature that captures industry-specific risk patterns. Some industries may inherently have higher default rates, and this encoding allows the model to learn those patterns while avoiding the cardinality issues of one-hot encoding.

These features address different aspects of credit risk:
1. A fundamental financial ratio
2. A normalized version of an important temporal feature
3. A domain-specific risk pattern captured through target encoding

Each leverages existing features in ways that should be meaningful for credit decisions while handling data quality issues like skewness and extreme values.

2025-08-16 14:35:03,272 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for credit card application success prediction:

1. <CreditScore_Income_interaction><cross><CreditScore><Income><Interaction_term_between_credit_score_and_income_as_high_income_with_good_credit_may_have_higher_approval_rates>

Rationale: Combining credit score with income could capture an important interaction effect where applicants with both high income and good credit scores are more likely to be approved. This creates a new feature that might be more predictive than either feature alone.

2. <DebtToIncomeRatio_clipped><bin><DebtToIncomeRatio><Clipped_version_of_DebtToIncomeRatio_to_reduce_impact_of_extreme_outliers>

Rationale: The current DebtToIncomeRatio has extreme values (up to 17,750,000) which could distort model performance. Binning or clipping this feature could make it more robust while still capturing the underlying debt burden information.

3. <IndustryRisk_Age_interaction><cross><IndustryRiskScore><Age><Interaction_between_industry_risk_and_age_as_risk_perception_may_vary_by_age_group>

Rationale: Older applicants in high-risk industries might be viewed differently than younger ones. This interaction could help capture nuanced risk assessments that depend on both factors simultaneously.

These features were chosen because:
1) They create meaningful interactions between logically related variables
2) They address potential issues with extreme values in the data
3) They attempt to capture domain knowledge about credit risk assessment
4) They maintain interpretability while potentially increasing predictive power

The cross operations are particularly valuable as they can reveal non-linear relationships that simple linear models might miss, while the binning operation helps with robustness against outliers.

2025-08-16 14:37:29,215 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps to improve the credit card approval prediction model:

1. <Age_Employed_interaction><cross><Age><Employed><Interaction_between_age_and_employment_status_as_older_applicants_may_have_different_approval_rates_based_on_employment>
   - Reasoning: Combining age with employment status could capture nuanced patterns where older unemployed applicants may have different approval odds than younger unemployed applicants.

2. <CreditScore_IndustryRisk_interaction><cross><CreditScore><IndustryRiskScore><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_industry_risk_to_capture_how_risk_perception_varies_by_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: This could reveal how industry risk factors interact with individual credit scores in the approval decision process.

3. <DebtToIncomeRatio_zscore><zscore><DebtToIncomeRatio><Standardized_version_of_DebtToIncomeRatio_to_normalize_scale_while_preserving_outlier_information>
   - Reasoning: The original DebtToIncomeRatio has extreme outliers. Z-score normalization would make this feature more manageable for models while keeping the relative ordering information.

These features were chosen because:
1) They create meaningful interactions between fundamental demographic and financial factors
2) They address the extreme value issues in financial ratios while preserving information
3) They capture potential non-linear relationships that simple features might miss
4) They avoid direct mathematical operations on categorical variables
5) They maintain interpretability while adding predictive power

2025-08-16 14:40:00,588 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for credit card approval prediction:

1. <CreditScore_Age_Employed_interaction><cross><CreditScoreAgeInteraction><Employed_Married_interaction><Interaction_between_credit_score_age_and_employment_status_to_capture_complex_relationships>
   - Reasoning: Combining the existing credit score-age interaction with employment/marital status may reveal patterns where employed individuals with certain credit profiles are more likely to be approved. The cross operation creates all possible combinations of these categorical features.

2. <DebtToIncomeRatio_sigmoid><sigmoid><DebtToIncomeRatio_log><Non-linear_transformation_of_log_debt-to-income_ratio_to_compress_extreme_values>
   - Reasoning: The DebtToIncomeRatio_log has extreme values (-13.8 to 16.7). Applying sigmoid will compress these to (0,1) range while preserving ordinal relationships, which may be more useful for linear models.

3. <IndustryRiskScore_Age_ZScore><zscore><IndustryRisk_Age_interaction><Standardized_version_of_industry_risk_age_interaction_to_normalize_scale>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between industry risk and age is currently categorical. Converting it to numerical via label encoding then standardizing could help models better utilize this interaction while maintaining proper scaling.

These steps aim to:
1) Create higher-order interactions between important features
2) Handle extreme value distributions more effectively
3) Convert meaningful categorical interactions to properly scaled numerical features

Each maintains the original information while potentially making patterns more accessible to the model.

2025-08-16 14:42:22,686 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for credit card approval prediction:

1. <CreditScore_IndustryRisk_interaction><cross><CreditScore><IndustryRiskScore><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_industry_risk_to_capture_sector-specific_risk_profiles>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit score with industry risk may reveal patterns where certain industries have different approval thresholds. This creates a more nuanced risk assessment than either feature alone.

2. <DebtToIncomeRatio_sqrt><sqrt><DebtToIncomeRatio_log><Square_root_transform_of_log_debt-to-income_to_reduce_skew_while_preserving_monotonicity>
   - Reasoning: The log-transformed debt-to-income ratio still has extreme values (range -13.8 to 16.7). A square root transform would further compress the scale while maintaining ordinal relationships, potentially making patterns more discernible to models.

3. <Employed_Married_Citizen_interaction><cross><Employed_Married_interaction><Citizen><Three-way_interaction_between_employment_marital_status_and_citizenship_status>
   - Reasoning: Citizenship status may interact with employment and marital status in ways that affect creditworthiness (e.g., temporary citizens with stable jobs vs permanent residents). This captures more complex demographic patterns.

These features:
1) Create meaningful interactions between financial and demographic factors
2) Further normalize heavily skewed financial ratios
3) Add higher-order combinations that may reveal subgroup-specific approval patterns
All while avoiding mathematical operations on categorical variables and focusing on interpretable transformations.

2025-08-16 14:44:51,543 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance, with explanations:

1. <IncomeDebtRatio_log><log><IncomeDebtRatio><Log_transform_of_IncomeDebtRatio_to_handle_skew_and_extreme_values>
   - Reasoning: IncomeDebtRatio has extreme values (range up to 1M) and high std (49247). Log transform will compress the scale while preserving ordinal relationships, making it more usable for linear models.

2. <Age_IndustryRisk_interaction><cross><Age><IndustryRiskScore><Interaction_between_age_and_industry_risk_to_capture_age-dependent_risk_profiles>
   - Reasoning: The existing IndustryRisk_Age_interaction is categorical, but a numerical interaction may provide more granular information. Different age groups may have different risk profiles based on their industry.

3. <EmployedYearsInteraction_sigmoid><sigmoid><EmployedYearsInteraction><Sigmoid_transform_of_employment_years_to_bound_values_and_highlight_nonlinear_effects>
   - Reasoning: EmployedYearsInteraction has a skewed distribution (median=0, mean=1.2). Sigmoid will bound values between 0-1 while preserving monotonicity, which may help models better capture the diminishing returns of additional employment years.

These operations were chosen because:
1) They address specific data distribution issues (skew, extreme values)
2) They create meaningful interactions not fully captured by existing features
3) They use appropriate transforms for the data types involved
4) They avoid operations that could introduce noise or instability (like dividing categoricals)
