2025-08-18 21:09:37,907 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three feature‐engineering steps, along with the reasoning:

1. Create a ratio of an individual’s income to the median income in their zip code. This captures relative wealth compared to local peers, which may influence approval likelihood.  
2. Multiply debt by age to form an interaction term reflecting that the same level of debt may pose different risks at different ages.  
3. Label‐encode the age bins so the model can treat age groups as ordered numeric values rather than unordered categories.

2025-08-18 21:12:56,235 - INFO - LLM Output: To capture non‐linear interactions and group‐level signals that may improve separability:

1. Multiply CreditScore intensity by income level (log) to let the model pick up stronger joint effects of credit health and earnings.  
2. Encode the average income per age bin so that the model knows age‐related earning patterns beyond raw age and income.  
3. Capture variability in debt within each ethnicity group, highlighting groups with more dispersed debt profiles which may correlate with default risk.
