2025-08-16 15:18:11,371 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtToIncome><divide><Debt><Income><Debt divided by Income, financial health indicator>  
   Reasoning: Captures debt burden relative to income. Despite potential zeros in Income (median=5, Q1=0), this ratio is a strong financial predictor. Downstream imputation can handle zeros.

2. <IndustryTargetEnc><target_encoding><Industry><Target encoding of Industry for approval likelihood>  
   Reasoning: Industry may influence approval rates (e.g., Financials vs. Education). Target encoding leverages label information to create a predictive feature, handling high-cardinality categories effectively.

3. <EmployedMarriedInteraction><cross><Employed><Married><Interaction between employment and marital status>  
   Reasoning: Combines two binary features (Employed and Married) into a categorical interaction. Employed married individuals may have higher stability, improving predictive power for approval. Uses cross for categorical safety.

3. <Employed_x_DriversLicense><cross><Employed><DriversLicense><Categorical interaction between employment status and driver's license possession>

### Reasoning:
1. PriorDefault_x_BankCustomer: Multiplying binary flags creates a new feature highlighting high-risk applicants (both prior default AND bank customer). This may capture nuanced risk patterns missed by individual features.
2. LogIncome: Income is highly skewed (mean=797, max=51100). Log transform normalizes the distribution, helping linear models and reducing outlier impact. Added epsilon avoids log(0) issues.
3. Employed_x_DriversLicense: Cross creates categorical combinations (e.g., employed_with_license). This may reveal subgroups with distinct approval patterns (e.g., employed/license holders as lower risk).

2025-08-16 15:35:42,849 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the dataset and task requirements, here are three feature engineering steps designed to improve credit card approval prediction:

1. Logarithmic transformation of DebtToIncome  
   The extreme range ([0, 26M]) and high std (3.5M) suggest severe skewness. Log transformation normalizes distributions and reduces outlier impact.  
   <LogDebtToIncome><log><DebtToIncome><Log-transformed DebtToIncome to reduce skewness and scale effects>

2. Employment stability metric  
   Combines employment status and tenure. Employed individuals with longer tenure indicate stability.  
   <EmployedStability><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Employment status multiplied by years employed to measure job stability>

3. Regional credit behavior feature  
   Uses ZipCode grouping to capture location-based patterns in prior defaults.  
   <ZipDefaultRate><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><PriorDefault><Average prior default rate per ZipCode indicating regional credit risk>  

Reasoning:  
- LogDebtToIncome: Addresses extreme skew in debt-to-income ratio which can distort linear models  
- EmployedStability: Creates a unified stability metric since employment alone (mean=0.44) may be insufficient  
- ZipDefaultRate: Leverages geographic patterns (ZipCode range=0-2000) where traditional encoding fails  
- Avoids operations on categoricals per Rule #2 and uses groupby for aggregation instead of risky divisions

2025-08-16 15:42:46,516 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. Log transformation for Income to reduce skewness  
   Income is highly skewed (mean=797.4, std=3391.4). Log transformation stabilizes variance and improves linear model compatibility.  
   <LogIncome><log><Income><Log-transformed Income to handle skewness>

2. Grouped mean of Income by Industry  
   Industry-specific income averages capture economic sector influence on creditworthiness, supplementing individual income.  
   <IndustryIncomeMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><Income><Mean Income per Industry sector>

3. Interaction: BankCustomer status and CreditScore  
   Credit scores may have stronger predictive power for bank customers (access to financial history). Multiplication emphasizes scores for this group.  
   <BankCustomer_CreditScore><multiply><BankCustomer><CreditScore><CreditScore amplified for bank customers>

2025-08-16 15:50:42,538 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeDeviation><subtract><Income><IndustryIncomeMean><Deviation of individual income from industry average income>
   Reasoning: Captures whether an applicant's income is above or below their industry norm, which may indicate financial stability relative to peers and influence creditworthiness.

2. <PriorDefault_x_ZipDefaultRate><multiply><PriorDefault><ZipDefaultRate><Interaction between personal default history and area default rate>
   Reasoning: Multiplicative interaction highlights applicants with prior defaults in high-risk zip codes, potentially indicating compounded risk factors that standalone features might miss.

3. <Employed_x_LogIncome><multiply><Employed><LogIncome><Employment status weighted by log-transformed income>
   Reasoning: Amplifies income significance for employed applicants (where income stability matters more) while handling skew via log transform. Non-employed applicants get zeroed automatically.

2025-08-16 15:55:10,082 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <WorkDuration><subtract><Age><StartingAge><Duration of working life in years, calculated as current age minus starting work age>
   Reasoning: This feature quantifies total workforce experience duration. Longer durations may indicate stability, while discrepancies between YearsEmployed and WorkDuration could reveal employment gaps – crucial for creditworthiness assessment given YearsEmployed's low median (1 year). Helps contextualize employment history.

2. <IncomeIndustryZScore><groupbythenmean><Industry><Income><Mean income within each industry for z-score calculation>
   Reasoning: IndustryIncomeMean provides industry averages, but lacks dispersion context. This enables future z-score computation (individual income minus group mean divided by group std), highlighting income outliers within industries – high earners in low-income sectors may be lower-risk.

3. <Employed_x_IndustryTargetEnc><multiply><Employed><IndustryTargetEnc><Interaction of employment status with industry approval rate>
   Reasoning: Amplifies signal for employed applicants in high-approval industries (e.g., Financials: 0.32 vs Healthcare: 0.58). IndustryTargetEnc alone doesn't distinguish employment status – multiplying by Employed (0/1) creates a premium feature for employed applicants in favorable sectors while zeroing out unemployed.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score per industry as industry-specific risk indicator>

Reasoning:  
1. Sigmoid transformation of LogDebtToIncome handles extreme values (range [-13.8, 17.1]) by compressing to (0,1), potentially improving model stability while preserving monotonicity.  
2. Interaction feature combines PriorDefault and ZipDefaultRate since applicants with prior defaults in high-risk zip codes may exhibit compound risk not captured additively.  
3. Group aggregation of CreditScore by Industry provides contextual industry risk profiles, complementing existing IndustryTargetEnc with actual credit behavior data.

3. <CreditScoreAdjusted><multiply><CreditScore><(1 - PriorDefault)><Credit score weighted by absence of prior default, emphasizing clean financial history>

Reasoning:  
1. BankCustomerStability: Combines banking relationship (BankCustomer) with job tenure (EmployedStability). Applicants with both bank accounts and stable employment likely demonstrate financial reliability, reducing approval risk. Multiplication creates a synergistic feature where high values indicate strong stability.  
2. IncomeIndustryRatio: Contextualizes income by industry norms (IndustryIncomeMean). Raw income can be misleading without industry context (e.g., $50k is high in education but low in tech). This ratio highlights over/under-performers in their sector, a key risk indicator.  
3. CreditScoreAdjusted: Discounts credit scores for prior defaults (PriorDefault). Since prior defaults severely impact creditworthiness, this feature isolates the predictive power of credit scores only for low-risk applicants (PriorDefault=0) while nullifying it for high-risk cases.
