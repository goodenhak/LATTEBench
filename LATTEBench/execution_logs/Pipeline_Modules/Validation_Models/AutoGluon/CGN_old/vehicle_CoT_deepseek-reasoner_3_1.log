### Reasoning:
1. ASPECT_RATIO_RATIO: Combines two distinct aspect ratio measures. Vehicles like BUS/VAN have different elongation patterns compared to OPEL/SAAB. This ratio amplifies their shape differences.
2. LOG_VARIANCE_MINOR: SCALED_VARIANCE_MINOR has high variance (std=174). Log transform compresses scale, making relationships more linear and helping algorithms like logistic regression.
3. SKEWNESS_ASYMMETRY: Differences in skewness between axes may reveal orientation-specific traits (e.g., BUS silhouettes show consistent asymmetry from side views).

### Reasoning:
1. LOG_RADIUS_RATIO: 
   - RADIUS_RATIO (range 104-333, std=32.9) shows moderate skewness. Log transformation compresses scale extremes, improves normality, and helps linear models capture relationships better.

2. PR_MAX_AR_RATIO: 
   - Combines PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO (mean=61.8) and MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO (mean=8.6). Vehicles like buses/vans have different length-to-width proportions. This ratio highlights relative elongation differences between classes.

3. KURTOSIS_DIFF: 
   - KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR (mean=188.9) and KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MAJOR (mean=12.7) measure tailedness on orthogonal axes. Their difference quantifies distribution asymmetry, potentially distinguishing boxy vehicles (vans) vs curved shapes (cars).

3. COMPACT_CIRC_PRODUCT<multiply><COMPACTNESS><CIRCULARITY><Product of compactness and circularity to capture multiplicative interaction of shape density measures.>

Reasoning:  
1. SQUARE_CIRCULARITY: Circularity values (range 33-59) show moderate variation. Squaring emphasizes higher values, potentially better separating compact vehicles (VAN/BUS) from elongated ones (OPEL/SAAB) through amplified non-linear effects.  
2. SKEW_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF: Existing skewness features (SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR: μ=72.4, SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MINOR: μ=6.3) measure asymmetry along different axes. Their difference may reveal vehicle-specific asymmetry patterns (e.g., buses showing consistent directional skew).  
3. COMPACT_CIRC_PRODUCT: Combines two complementary shape descriptors (COMPACTNESS: (perim)²/area, CIRCULARITY: radius²/area). Their product could highlight vehicles with both high density and radial symmetry (e.g., vans vs sedans).
