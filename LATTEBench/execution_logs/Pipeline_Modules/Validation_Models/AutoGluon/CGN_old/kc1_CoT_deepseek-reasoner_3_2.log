2025-08-15 23:21:09,656 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <has_comments><greater><lOComment><0><Binary indicator for presence of comments (lOComment > 0)>
   - Reasoning: lOComment has 75% of values at 0 (Q3=0). Converting to binary captures the meaningful distinction between commented/uncommented modules, which may relate to code quality practices.

2. <log_loc><log><loc><Natural logarithm of loc to handle skewness>
   - Reasoning: loc has high skew (mean=20.14 >> median=9.0). Log transformation reduces skewness and helps linear models better capture relationships while maintaining locality information.

3. <complexity_density><ratio><v(g)><loc><Cyclomatic complexity per line of code (v(g)/loc)>
   - Reasoning: Combines structural complexity (v(g)) with size (loc). High complexity density may indicate error-prone code. Example: Defective module had v(g)/loc=0.348 vs 0.135 in non-defective.

Alternative considerations:
- Instead of log_loc, sqrt(e) was considered for Halstead effort but log on loc addresses a more fundamental size metric.
- v(g)/loc preferred over v/ev(g) ratios as cyclomatic complexity is more interpretable per line.
- Binary comment feature chosen over binning+encoding to avoid multi-step workflows.

2. <halstead_effort_per_line><divide><e><loc><Halstead effort per line of code>
   - Reasoning: Normalizes development effort by code size. Effort (e) is highly skewed (mean=5016, std=16238), so per-line normalization provides better scaling and may reveal modules with concentrated complexity.

3. <operand_variety_ratio><divide><uniq_Opnd><total_Opnd><Ratio of unique operands to total operands>
   - Reasoning: Measures code redundancy. Low ratios indicate repeated operand use, potentially signaling copy-paste code or poor maintainability. Both features are numerical and division captures this relationship directly.

3. <effort_per_branch><divide><e><branchCount><Halstead effort per control flow branch, measuring effort concentration>

Reasoning:  
1. essential_complexity_ratio: Captures structural quality by measuring how much complexity is inherent (ev(g)) vs. total (v(g)). Higher ratios may indicate convoluted logic.  
2. log_halstead_effort: Addresses extreme right-skew in 'e' (mean=5016, std=16238). Log transformation improves normality for linear models.  
3. effort_per_branch: Combines Halstead effort with control flow complexity (branchCount). High values may indicate risky code sections with concentrated effort.  

Key improvements:  
- Introduces meaningful complexity interactions missing in original features  
- Mitigates skewness that disturbs model optimization  
- Creates psychologically relevant metrics aligned with software quality principles  
- Avoids categorical feature misuse (all use numerical operators appropriately)

2025-08-15 23:42:30,701 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the data characteristics and task goals, here are 3 feature engineering steps designed to capture non-linear relationships, complexity interactions, and normalized quality indicators:

1. Complexity-Effort Concentration  
   <complexity_effort_concentration><multiply><v(g)><halstead_effort_per_line><Product of cyclomatic complexity and effort per line, highlighting modules where high complexity concentrates development effort>  
   *Reasoning*: Combines structural complexity (v(g)) with localized effort intensity (halstead_effort_per_line). Defects often emerge where complexity and effort intersect, especially when high effort is applied to complex modules.

2. Normalized Design Complexity  
   <norm_design_complexity><divide><iv(g)><loc><Design complexity per line of code, normalizing for module size>  
   *Reasoning*: Raw design complexity (iv(g)) scales with module size. Dividing by loc creates size-invariant complexity density, exposing intrinsically complex code segments regardless of length.

3. Essential Complexity Skew Handler  
   <inv_essential_complexity><reciprocal><essential_complexity_ratio><Reciprocal of essential complexity ratio to amplify low-quality structural indicators>  
   *Reasoning*: The reciprocal transformation (1/x) dramatically amplifies low values of essential_complexity_ratio (where ratios <<1 indicate poor structure), making subtle quality differences more detectable to models.

*Key improvement strategies*:  
- Non-linear amplification: Reciprocal transform targets the long-tail distribution of quality metrics  
- Interaction terms: Multiplicative features uncover synergistic effects between complexity/effort  
- Size normalization: Ratios counteract LOC-biased metrics  
- Skew mitigation: Targets highly skewed distributions (e.g., essential complexity) through non-linear reshaping  

These features complement existing transforms like log_halstead_effort and complexity_density by adding orthogonal dimensions of complexity-effort interaction and structural quality amplification.

2025-08-15 23:49:11,792 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <vol_cyclo_ratio><divide><v><v(g)><Ratio of Halstead volume to cyclomatic complexity, measuring code complexity per control flow unit>
   Reasoning: Combines two fundamental complexity metrics (Halstead volume and cyclomatic complexity) into a ratio. This may identify modules where high algorithmic complexity coexists with high code volume - a potential defect hotspot. Since both features are numerical and v(g) has no zeros (min=1.0), division is safe.

2. <sqrt_effort_per_branch><sqrt><effort_per_branch><Square root transformation of effort per branch to reduce skewness>
   Reasoning: effort_per_branch is highly skewed (range=[0,5101], mean=430.7, std=652.7). Square root transformation compresses extreme values while preserving order, making the distribution more Gaussian-like. This helps models sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., logistic regression) and reduces outlier influence in tree-based models.

3. <has_comments_target><target_encoding><has_comments><Mean defect rate per comment presence category>
   Reasoning: Target encoding transforms the categorical has_comments feature into a numerical value representing historical defect probability. This captures the predictive relationship between comment presence and defects more effectively than label encoding, as defect rates may differ significantly between modules with/without comments.

Reasoning:  
1. Binning loc: Creates categorical size groups (small/medium/large modules) to capture non-linear size-defect relationships. Quantile-based binning handles skewness in loc (Q1=4, Q3=24).  
2. Target encoding loc_bin: Encodes defect probability per size category, leveraging historical patterns where defect risk may spike in medium-sized modules (e.g., 24-100 LOC).  
3. Comments per complexity: New ratio (lOComment/v(g)) directly measures documentation density relative to control flow complexity. Combines two critical quality signals—high complexity with low comments may indicate defect-prone code.  

*Avoided redundant features: comment_density (comments/LOC) exists, but comments/complexity is novel. effort_per_cyclo was considered but deferred—existing vol_cyclo_ratio and log_halstead_effort partially cover effort-complexity relationships.*

Reasoning:  
1. Grouped complexity by size: Since module size (loc_bin) strongly influences defect probability, calculating the mean v(g) (cyclomatic complexity) per size bin creates a contextual benchmark. Modules with complexity significantly higher than their size group's average may be defect-prone.  
2. Comment-complexity interaction: The presence of comments (has_comments) may correlate with development practices affecting quality. Grouping v(g) by comment presence reveals if complexity patterns differ between commented/uncommented modules, potentially exposing hidden risk factors.  
3. Efficiency metric: The i/v ratio (Halstead intelligence per volume) combines two fundamental code properties. High values suggest concise, efficient logic, which may correlate with fewer defects, while low values could indicate convoluted implementations. This leverages existing Halstead features in a novel, interpretable way.  

*Avoided transformations on highly skewed features (e.g., e) due to existing log features and potential redundancy. Focused on interactions and contextual aggregations to capture non-linear relationships.*

Reasoning:  
1. effort_per_complexity: Directly relates development effort (e) to code complexity (v(g)). High effort relative to complexity may indicate problematic code sections.  
2. log_effort_loc_interaction: Captures synergistic effects between effort and size after log transformation, addressing skewed distributions while modeling nonlinear relationships.  
3. vg_mean_by_comments: Groups by comment presence (categorical) to compute average complexity, revealing whether commented modules exhibit systematically different complexity patterns.

   - Reasoning: Grouping by loc_bin (code size categories) and averaging log_halstead_effort captures typical effort levels for different module sizes. This smooths effort values within size ranges, potentially revealing size-effort relationships more predictive of defects than raw values.

2. <complexity_comment_interaction><cross><v(g)><has_comments><Interaction between cyclomatic complexity and comment presence via Cartesian product>
   - Reasoning: Combining cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and comment presence (has_comments) as a categorical interaction may reveal if comments mitigate defect risk in complex code. Using cross (instead of arithmetic) preserves categorical nature while creating combined categories (e.g., high-complexity-with-comments).

3. <reciprocal_essential_complexity><reciprocal><ev(g)><Reciprocal of essential complexity to emphasize low-complexity modules>
   - Reasoning: Essential complexity (ev(g)) has low values (Q1/median/Q3 = 1.0), where defects may be rare. Reciprocal transformation (1/x) amplifies differences in low-complexity regions, potentially improving sensitivity to defect-prone simple modules.

3. <mean_cyclo_by_has_comments><groupbythenmean><has_comments><v(g)><Mean cyclomatic complexity grouped by comment presence indicating complexity patterns in documented code>

### Reasoning:
1. Interaction Feature: 
   - Combines McCabe's control-flow complexity (v(g)) with Halstead's cognitive effort (log_halstead_effort). 
   - High values in both may indicate modules with elevated defect risk due to intertwined structural and cognitive complexity.
   - Addresses skewness via pre-logged effort.

2. Binning Cyclomatic Complexity: 
   - v(g) has high skew (mean=2.76, range=1-45). Binning captures non-linear effects where defect probability may spike at complexity thresholds.
   - Enables categorical modeling of complexity tiers (e.g., low/medium/high-risk bins).

3. Group Aggregation: 
   - Groups v(g) by has_comments to compare complexity patterns in documented vs. undocumented code. 
   - May reveal higher defect likelihood in high-complexity modules lacking comments. Group means provide contextual complexity baselines.
