2025-08-18 09:08:06,269 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three candidate feature‐engineering steps that could help the model by reducing skew, capturing relative scale, and embedding group‐level behavior:

1. Applying a log transform on credit_amount to reduce skew and make outliers less extreme.  
2. Creating a ratio between monthly installment and age to capture how burdened a borrower is relative to their life stage.  
3. Aggregating the average monthly credit per job category, so the model can learn deviations from typical job‐level behavior.
