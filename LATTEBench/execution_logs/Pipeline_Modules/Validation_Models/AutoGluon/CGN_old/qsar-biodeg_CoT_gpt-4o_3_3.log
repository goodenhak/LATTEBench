   Reasoning: Non-linear transformations, like squaring numerical features, can sometimes capture patterns and nonlinear relationships in the data, which are not evident from the original feature.

2. <log_ratio_heavy_atoms_C_percentage><log><ratio_heavy_atoms_C_percentage><natural_log_of_ratio_heavy_atoms_C_percentage_to_handle_skewness>
   Reasoning: If a ratio feature exhibits skewness, applying a logarithmic transformation can help normalize the feature distribution, which may lead to better model performance.

3. <Interaction_F03_CN_Me><multiply><F03[C-N]><Me><interaction_between_F03_CN_and_mean_atomic_Sanderson_electronegativity>
   Reasoning: Creating interaction terms between related features, such as the frequency of C-N bonds at a specific distance and the mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity, can help capture complex dependencies and interactions between attributes, potentially leading to enhanced predictive power.
