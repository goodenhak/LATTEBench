   Reasoning: Combining the credit_age_ratio with the employment_encoded feature could offer insights into how an individual's potential financial stability, as inferred from their credit behavior and employment status, affects their likelihood of receiving a credit. This can capture a nuanced interaction between these features that might be influential.

2. \<risk_per_credit_amount\> \<divide\> \<risk_score\> \<credit_amount\> \<Ratio_of_risk_score_over_credit_amount_to_measure_risk_per_unit_of_credit_requested\>  

   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of risk_score over credit_amount can help in understanding how much risk is associated with each unit of credit requested. This might give an indication of whether the credit amount seems justified given the individual's risk score.

3. \<age_employment_group_mean_risk\> \<groupbythenmean\> \<age_employment_combination\> \<risk_score\> \<Mean_risk_score_for_each_age_and_employment_combination_group\>  

   Reasoning: By examining the average risk score across different combinations of age and employment, we can identify patterns or trends that may be useful for credit decision-making. This aggregated feature may highlight demographic groups with either higher or lower creditworthiness tendencies.
