   - Applying exponential transformation to Age could highlight differences in older age groups, which might have distinct credit application success patterns.

2. <Debt_to_Income_ratio>ratio<Debt><Income><RatioofDebttoIncome_foreconomicstressfactor>  
   - Creating a ratio of Debt to Income can provide insight into financial stress. Higher stress levels may impact credit card application success.

3. <Industry_BankCustomer_cross>cross<Industry><BankCustomer><InteractionofIndustryandBankCustomer_accountownershipacrossindustries>  
   - Cross Industry and BankCustomer to explore if certain industries have different bank account ownership characteristics, potentially impacting credit application success.
