2025-08-17 15:06:42,637 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream classification model's performance:

1. <COMPACTNESS_CIRCULARITY_RATIO><ratio><COMPACTNESS><CIRCULARITY><Ratio of compactness to circularity, capturing relative shape properties that may distinguish vehicle types>
   - Reasoning: The ratio between these two shape descriptors could highlight unique proportions that differentiate vehicle classes (e.g., buses might have different compactness-to-circularity ratios than vans).

2. <SCALED_VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF><diff><SCALED_VARIANCE_MAJOR><SCALED_VARIANCE_MINOR><Difference between major and minor axis scaled variances, indicating asymmetry in silhouette>
   - Reasoning: The difference in variance between major and minor axes could help distinguish elongated vehicles (like buses) from more symmetrical ones (like vans).

3. <ELONGATEDNESS_RECTANGULARITY_CROSS><cross><ELONGATEDNESS><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY><Interaction between elongation and rectangularity features>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between these two shape characteristics might reveal patterns specific to certain vehicle classes (e.g., buses are typically both elongated and rectangular).

These features were chosen because:
1. They create new perspectives on shape relationships that raw features alone might not capture
2. They focus on ratios and differences between related geometric properties
3. They avoid simple linear combinations, instead creating non-linear relationships
4. They leverage domain knowledge about how different vehicle types have distinct silhouette characteristics

The operations were selected to:
- Preserve scale relationships (using ratio instead of division)
- Maintain interpretability
- Avoid introducing noise from overly complex transformations
- Focus on geometric properties most likely to differ between vehicle classes

2025-08-17 15:10:25,670 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream classification model's performance:

1. <ASYMMETRY_INDEX><ratio><SCALED_VARIANCE_MAJOR><SCALED_VARIANCE_MINOR><Ratio of major to minor axis variance, capturing silhouette asymmetry which may differ by vehicle type>

Reasoning: The ratio between major and minor axis variances could highlight structural differences between vehicle types (e.g., buses being more symmetrical than vans). This builds on the existing SCALED_VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_DIFF but provides a normalized measure.

2. <SHAPE_COMPLEXITY><multiply><COMPACTNESS><CIRCULARITY><Product of compactness and circularity to capture combined shape complexity that may distinguish vehicle silhouettes>

Reasoning: Multiplying these two fundamental shape descriptors creates a feature that captures their interaction. Different vehicle types likely have distinct combinations of these properties (e.g., buses being both compact and circular).

3. <NORMALIZED_ELONGATION><zscore><ELONGATEDNESS><Z-score normalized elongation to better compare across vehicle types while maintaining distribution shape>

Reasoning: Normalizing elongation will help the model compare this feature across different vehicle sizes while preserving the relative differences that may be important for classification. The z-score transformation is particularly useful here as the original feature has a reasonable distribution.

2025-08-17 15:14:51,046 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream classification model's performance, along with their reasoning:

1. <COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_INTERACTION><multiply><COMPACTNESS><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR><Product of compactness and major axis skewness to capture interaction effects between shape regularity and asymmetry>  
   *Reasoning*: Vehicles like buses may have both high compactness (blocky shape) and low skewness (symmetrical), while vans might have lower compactness but higher skewness. This interaction term could help distinguish such patterns.

2. <SCALED_VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_RATIO><ratio><SCALED_VARIANCE_MAJOR><SCALED_VARIANCE_MINOR><Ratio of major to minor axis scaled variance as an alternative asymmetry measure to ASYMMETRY_INDEX>  
   *Reasoning*: The existing ASYMMETRY_INDEX uses variance ratio, but a direct ratio feature might capture different scaling relationships. Buses/VANs likely have different variance structures than cars.

3. <SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_NORMALIZED><zscore><SHAPE_COMPLEXITY><Z-score normalized version of SHAPE_COMPLEXITY to make it more comparable across vehicle types while preserving outliers>  
   *Reasoning*: While SHAPE_COMPLEXITY is useful, normalization helps models handle its wide range (2701-6498). Outliers here may correspond to distinct vehicle classes (e.g., very complex BUS silhouettes).

These features target:
- Interaction effects between fundamental shape properties
- Alternative formulations of asymmetry measures
- Better-scaled versions of composite features
All while avoiding operations on categorical features directly and focusing on numerical relationships that likely differ between vehicle classes.

2025-08-17 15:18:38,136 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream classification model's performance:

1. <COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MINOR_INTERACTION><multiply><COMPACTNESS><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MINOR><Interaction between compactness and minor axis skewness to capture how shape regularity interacts with minor axis asymmetry>
   - Reasoning: We already have an interaction feature for major axis skewness (COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_INTERACTION). Creating a similar feature for the minor axis could provide complementary information about how shape compactness interacts with asymmetry along the other axis.

2. <SCALED_VAR_MAJOR_MINOR_SUM><plus><SCALED_VARIANCE_MAJOR><SCALED_VARIANCE_MINOR><Sum of major and minor axis scaled variances to capture total shape variability>
   - Reasoning: While we have difference and ratio features for these variances, the absolute sum could provide information about overall shape complexity that might help distinguish between vehicle types with different overall variability patterns.

3. <ELONGATEDNESS_NORMALIZED_CROSS><cross><NORMALIZED_ELONGATION><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY><Interaction between normalized elongation and rectangularity to capture complex shape relationships>
   - Reasoning: The cross product of these two features could reveal non-linear relationships between elongation and rectangularity that might be characteristic of certain vehicle types (e.g., buses might have different elongation-rectangularity patterns than vans).

These features were chosen because:
1. They create interactions between different aspects of shape that might have non-linear relationships important for classification
2. They complement existing features by providing alternative perspectives on similar concepts
3. They maintain interpretability while potentially capturing complex patterns
4. They avoid operations that would be problematic for categorical features or create numerical instability

2025-08-17 15:22:20,385 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance by capturing meaningful interactions and transformations of the existing features:

1. <COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_INTERACTION><multiply><COMPACTNESS><SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR><Interaction between compactness and major axis skewness to capture how shape regularity interacts with major axis asymmetry>
   - Reasoning: The existing COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MINOR_INTERACTION is useful, but the interaction with major axis skewness (SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR) is missing. This could help distinguish vehicles with similar minor-axis asymmetry but different major-axis asymmetry (e.g., buses vs. vans).

2. <ELONGATEDNESS_RECTANGULARITY_CROSS><label_encode><ELONGATEDNESS_RECTANGULARITY_CROSS><Encoded categorical feature for ELONGATEDNESS_RECTANGULARITY_CROSS to use in linear models>
   - Reasoning: The categorical feature ELONGATEDNESS_RECTANGULARITY_CROSS likely contains valuable information about vehicle shape proportions. Label encoding will allow linear models (or tree-based models) to leverage this feature more effectively than the raw string values.

3. <SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_RATIO><ratio><SHAPE_COMPLEXITY><RADIUS_RATIO><Ratio of shape complexity to radius ratio to capture how intricate the shape is relative to its radial proportions>
   - Reasoning: Both SHAPE_COMPLEXITY and RADIUS_RATIO describe shape properties, but their ratio could highlight vehicles with high complexity but low radial variation (e.g., buses) vs. those with balanced complexity and radial variation (e.g., cars). This might help the model better separate classes. 

These steps focus on:
- Adding missing interactions (COMPACTNESS * SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR),
- Making categorical features usable (label_encode), 
- Creating interpretable ratios that could separate classes (SHAPE_COMPLEXITY / RADIUS_RATIO). 

Each leverages existing features in a way that aligns with the physical interpretation of vehicle silhouettes.

2025-08-17 15:26:00,668 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance, along with their reasoning:

1. <COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_RATIO><ratio><COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_INTERACTION><COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MINOR_INTERACTION><Ratio of major to minor axis compactness-skewness interactions to capture relative asymmetry importance>

Reasoning: This creates a new feature that captures the relative importance of major vs minor axis asymmetry in relation to compactness. Vehicles like buses and vans likely have different asymmetry patterns between major/minor axes compared to cars (Opel/Saab).

2. <SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_NORMALIZED_SQUARED><square><SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_NORMALIZED><Squared normalized shape complexity to emphasize extreme shape characteristics>

Reasoning: Squaring the normalized shape complexity will amplify the differences for vehicles with particularly simple or complex shapes (e.g., buses tend to have simpler rectangular shapes compared to cars). This non-linear transformation may help the model better separate these cases.

3. <ELONGATEDNESS_RECTANGULARITY_CROSS_ENCODED><label_encode><ELONGATEDNESS_RECTANGULARITY_CROSS><Encoded version of the categorical cross feature to make it usable in linear models>

Reasoning: The current categorical cross feature contains valuable information about the relationship between elongation and rectangularity, but needs to be encoded for most models to use it effectively. Label encoding preserves some ordinal relationships while converting to numerical.

2025-08-17 15:29:31,952 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance, along with their reasoning:

1. <COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_RATIO><ratio><COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_INTERACTION><COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MINOR_INTERACTION><Ratio of major to minor compactness-skewness interactions to create a more stable version of the existing ratio feature>

Reasoning: The existing COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_RATIO has extreme values (up to 1e10) which could dominate the model. Creating a ratio from the raw interaction values might produce a more normally distributed feature that's easier for models to handle.

2. <SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_RECTANGULARITY><multiply><SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY><Interaction between shape complexity and rectangularity to capture how shape features vary with vehicle length>

Reasoning: This multiplicative interaction could help distinguish vehicles where shape complexity scales differently with length (e.g., buses vs vans might have different relationships between these features).

3. <NORMALIZED_ASYMMETRY><multiply><ASYMMETRY_INDEX><NORMALIZED_ELONGATION><Product of asymmetry and normalized elongation to capture how asymmetry changes with elongation direction>

Reasoning: Since both features relate to shape distortion but from different perspectives (asymmetry vs elongation), their product might reveal vehicle-specific patterns in how these distortions co-occur.

These features were chosen because:
1. They create meaningful interactions between related physical shape characteristics
2. They avoid operations on categorical features directly
3. They help normalize extreme value ranges present in some original features
4. They capture potential non-linear relationships that simple models might miss

2025-08-17 15:33:21,592 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream classification model's performance:

1. <COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_LOG><log><COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_RATIO><Log_transform_of_high_variance_ratio_feature_to_normalize_distribution>
   - Reasoning: The COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_RATIO has an extremely high variance (std=1.9B). A log transform could help normalize this distribution and make it more useful for modeling while maintaining the relative ordering of values.

2. <SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_RECTANGULARITY_SQRT><sqrt><SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_RECTANGULARITY><Square_root_transform_to_reduce_right_skew_in_interaction_feature>
   - Reasoning: The interaction feature SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_RECTANGULARITY likely has a right-skewed distribution (common with product features). A square root transform can help normalize the distribution while preserving the interaction relationship.

3. <ASYMMETRY_ELONGATION_CROSS><cross><ASYMMETRY_INDEX><NORMALIZED_ELONGATION><Nonlinear_interaction_between_asymmetry_and_elongation_features>
   - Reasoning: While NORMALIZED_ASYMMETRY already captures a linear interaction, a cross operation could reveal more complex nonlinear relationships between these two important shape characteristics that might better discriminate between vehicle classes.

These transformations address:
- Extreme value normalization (log transform)
- Distribution skewness (sqrt transform)
- Capturing higher-order interactions (cross)
All while working within the constraints of the provided operators and avoiding problematic operations on categorical features.

2025-08-17 15:37:52,855 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream classification model's performance:

1. <COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_LOG_SQUARED><square><COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_LOG><Squared_log_transform_to_further_normalize_extreme_values>
- Reasoning: The log-transformed version of the high-variance ratio feature still shows some extreme values (range 1.03-23.08). Squaring this may help normalize the distribution further while maintaining the relative ordering of values.

2. <ASYMMETRY_SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_CROSS><cross><ASYMMETRY_INDEX><SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_NORMALIZED><Nonlinear_interaction_between_asymmetry_and_shape_complexity>
- Reasoning: Creating interaction terms between different aspects of shape characterization (asymmetry and complexity) may reveal patterns that are useful for distinguishing vehicle types, especially since these are normalized features that can be safely crossed.

3. <SCALED_RADIUS_GYRATION_RECTANGULARITY_RATIO><ratio><SCALED_RADIUS_OF_GYRATION><SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_RECTANGULARITY><Ratio_between_radius_of_gyration_and_rectangular_complexity>
- Reasoning: This creates a new shape descriptor that relates the distribution of mass (radius of gyration) to the rectangular complexity of the silhouette, which could be particularly useful for distinguishing between elongated vehicles like buses vs. more compact shapes like cars.

These operations were chosen because:
1. They address specific characteristics of the data (extreme values, potential interactions between shape features)
2. They create features with clear physical interpretations related to vehicle silhouettes
3. They avoid operations that could create numerical instability (like dividing by small numbers)
4. They combine features that likely capture complementary aspects of vehicle shape

2025-08-17 15:42:37,819 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance, along with the reasoning behind each:

1. <COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_LOG_SQUARED><sqrt><COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_LOG_SQUARED><square_root_of_log_squared_to_normalize_extreme_values>
   - Reasoning: The COMPACTNESS_SKEWNESS_MAJOR_MINOR_LOG_SQUARED feature has extreme values (range up to 532.96). Taking the square root will help normalize these values while preserving the relative differences, making the feature more suitable for models sensitive to feature scales.

2. <ASYMMETRY_SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_INTERACTION><cross><ASYMMETRY_INDEX><SHAPE_COMPLEXITY_NORMALIZED><nonlinear_interaction_between_asymmetry_and_normalized_shape_complexity>
   - Reasoning: Creating an explicit interaction term between asymmetry and shape complexity could capture important nonlinear relationships that might help distinguish between vehicle types, especially since these are fundamental shape characteristics.

3. <SCALED_RADIUS_GYRATION_RECT_RATIO_LOG><log><SCALED_RADIUS_GYRATION_RECTANGULARITY_RATIO><log_transform_of_ratio_to_normalize_distribution>
   - Reasoning: The ratio feature has a relatively small range (0.029-0.090). Applying a log transform can help emphasize relative differences in this ratio, which might be more informative for classification than the absolute values.

These transformations were chosen because:
1. They address features with extreme values or skewed distributions
2. They create potentially informative interactions between shape-related features
3. They maintain the interpretability of the features while making them more suitable for machine learning algorithms
4. They avoid operations that could create numerical instability (like dividing by small numbers)
