   *Reasoning: Target encoding the purpose feature incorporates historical approval rates for each loan type (e.g., cars vs education), adding predictive signal beyond raw categories. This leverages the target variable to quantify risk associated with specific purposes.*

2. repayment_income_ratio<divide><monthly_repayment><installment_commitment><Monthly repayment burden relative to income commitment (proxy for disposable income pressure)>  
   *Reasoning: Dividing monthly repayment by installment commitment (percentage of income) estimates absolute repayment burden per income unit. This interaction captures affordability stress more directly than either feature alone, as high repayments on low-income-commitment indicate severe strain.*

3. duration_age_ratio<divide><duration><age><Loan duration relative to borrower's age (normalizes long-term risk for younger applicants)>  
   *Reasoning: Longer loans pose higher default risk for older borrowers. This ratio adjusts duration by age, identifying cases like 60-month loans for 60yo (high risk) vs 25yo (lower risk), refining temporal risk assessment.*

2025-08-18 02:21:44,066 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <purpose_avg_credit><groupbythenmean><purpose><credit_amount><Average credit amount by purpose category, capturing typical loan sizes for different purposes>
Reasoning: Different loan purposes (e.g., cars vs education) may have different risk profiles. Group averages provide contextual information about typical loan sizes per category, which may correlate with repayment ability.

2. <debt_burden_ratio><multiply><existing_credits><monthly_repayment><Total monthly debt burden from current and existing credits at the bank>
Reasoning: Combines current loan repayment with existing credits to estimate total debt burden. Higher debt-to-income ratios often correlate with default risk, and this feature quantifies cumulative obligations.

3. <checking_savings_risk><target_encoding><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Target-encoded interaction between checking/savings status>
Reasoning: Checking/savings status likely interact (e.g., no checking + no savings is riskier than either alone). First cross categorical features, then target-encode to create a single numerical feature representing combined risk while avoiding high dimensionality.

3. age_debt_interaction<multiply><age><debt_burden_ratio><Interaction feature combining applicant age and debt burden>

Reasoning:  
1. Monthly burden captures repayment capacity better than total amount alone. The ratio reveals affordability pressure that raw credit_amount and duration can't express individually.  
2. Purpose target encoding leverages historical approval patterns per loan category, supplementing the existing purpose_avg_credit which only reflects amount averages.  
3. Age-debt interaction models non-linear effects - older applicants with high debt may have different risk profiles than young high-debt borrowers, which multiplicative terms capture better than additive features.  

Alternative effective transformations:  
- Grouped debt ratio by employment: <groupbythenmean><employment><debt_burden_ratio><Mean debt burden per employment category>  
- Credit history risk squared: <square><credit_history_risk><Non-linear amplification of risk score extremities>

   Reasoning: Creates a categorical interaction feature. Foreign workers applying for specific purposes (e.g., retraining or business) may exhibit distinct risk profiles compared to domestic workers, capturing joint effects not modeled by individual features.

2025-08-18 02:45:41,473 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction feature between checking account status and savings status to capture combined financial stability>
   Reasoning: Combining checking and savings status may reveal synergistic effects on creditworthiness that individual features miss. For example, no checking with no known savings indicates higher risk than either alone. This creates a new categorical feature for downstream encoding.

2. <credit_amount_sqrt><sqrt><credit_amount><Square root of credit amount to reduce skew and handle non-linear relationships>
   Reasoning: Credit_amount has high skewness (mean=3170, std=2769). Square root transformation compresses extreme values while preserving order, making patterns more discernible for linear models and improving gradient-based optimization.

3. <emp_prop_ratio><divide><employment><property_magnitude><Ratio of employment stability to property value magnitude after label encoding>
   Reasoning: First convert categoricals to numerical via label_encode:  
   - <emp_encoded><label_encode><employment>
   - <prop_encoded><label_encode><property_magnitude>
   Then calculate <emp_prop_ratio><divide><emp_encoded><prop_encoded>.  
   This quantifies the balance between job stability (e.g., unemployed=0) and asset backing (e.g., real estate=3), where low ratios may indicate higher default risk.

3. <log_credit_amount><log><credit_amount><Log-transformed credit amount to further reduce skew and handle outliers>

Reasoning:  
- ratio_credit_checking: Normalizes credit amount against checking-status group mean (existing feature mean_credit_by_checking), highlighting applicants requesting unusually large/small loans relative to peers, which may indicate risk.  
- property_foreign: Combines property ownership and foreign worker status (both categorical) to model how property collateral value differs for foreign workers, addressing potential subgroup-specific risk factors.  
- log_credit_amount: Applies stronger log transformation to credit_amount (beyond existing sqrt) to better handle right-skew (Q3=3860 vs max=18424), improving linear model assumptions and outlier robustness.  

Key improvements:  
1. Relative loan size via divide may outperform raw/transformed amounts.  
2. Targeted interaction (cross) addresses known socioeconomic risk factors.  
3. Complementary transformation (log) captures non-linearity differently than sqrt.

   *Reasoning: Savings status reflects financial stability. Target encoding leverages historical approval rates per savings category (e.g., <100, >=1000) as a predictive signal, complementing existing savings-related features.*

3. <log_ratio_credit_checking><log><ratio_credit_checking><Log-transformed ratio of credit amount to group mean>  
   *Reasoning: The ratio_credit_checking distribution is right-skewed (Q1=0.43, Q3=1.24). Applying log normalization reduces skew and handles extreme values, improving linear model compatibility while preserving relative size information.*
