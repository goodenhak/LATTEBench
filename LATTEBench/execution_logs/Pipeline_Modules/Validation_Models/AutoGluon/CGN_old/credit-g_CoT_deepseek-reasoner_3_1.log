2. <credit_amount_per_month><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Monthly repayment burden>
3. <purpose_target_encoded><target_encoding><purpose><Risk-encoded loan purpose>

Reasoning:  
1. Cross Feature: Combining credit_history and checking_status captures interaction effects (e.g., critical history + no checking is riskier than either alone).  
2. Ratio Feature: credit_amount/duration represents monthly repayment burden, a critical risk indicator (high burden → higher default risk).  
3. Target Encoding: Encodes purpose categories by historical approval rates (e.g., education loans may be riskier than domestic appliance), adding predictive signal.

   - Reasoning: Younger applicants with high monthly repayments may have higher default risk due to limited earning potential. This ratio quantifies burden relative to life stage.

2. savings_status_target_encoded<target_encoding>savings_status<Risk-encoded savings status (mean target per category)>
   - Reasoning: Savings status indicates financial resilience. Target encoding preserves predictive power while converting categorical information to numerical, capturing nonlinear relationships with default risk.

   - Reasoning: Job type (e.g., skilled/unemployed) combined with housing (own/rent) may reveal risk patterns (e.g., unemployed renters vs skilled homeowners). Cross operator creates compound categories for finer segmentation.

### Reasoning:
1. Savings-Emp Cross: Combines two financial stability indicators (savings and employment duration) into a single interaction feature. This may reveal joint effects like long employment with high savings being lower risk.
2. Log Age: Age distribution (mean 35.8, std 11.9) is right-skewed. Log transform normalizes the distribution and better captures diminishing returns of age on creditworthiness.
3. Credit-to-Income Ratio: Uses existing engineered feature credit_amount_per_month (monthly payment) and installment_commitment (income %). The ratio directly measures payment burden intensity, a key risk factor.

3. <mean_credit_by_savings><groupbythenmean><savings_status><credit_amount><Average credit amount grouped by savings status category>

### Reasoning:
1. log_credit_to_income: 
   - credit_to_income_ratio has high skew (range=6.31-2482.66, std=172.18). Log transformation compresses scale, normalizes distribution, and helps linear models capture non-linear relationships without adding complexity.

2. age_existing_credits_cross: 
   - Bins numerical age and existing_credits into categories first (implicit in cross), then combines them. This captures non-linear interactions (e.g., young applicants with multiple credits vs. older ones) that individual features might miss. Safer than arithmetic operations for discrete variables.

3. mean_credit_by_savings: 
   - Groups by savings_status (categorical) and aggregates credit_amount (mean). Reveals lending patterns (e.g., higher credits for stable savings), acting as a risk proxy. Grouped features often boost tree-based models by encoding contextual trends.

Reasoning:  
1. Multiplying log-scaled credit amount by sqrt(duration) captures non-linear repayment burden effects while reducing skew. Existing features like credit_amount_per_month assume linear relationships, while this exponential interaction better models diminishing returns.  
2. Crossing checking_status with employment creates a joint financial stability feature. Checking accounts indicate short-term liquidity while employment reflects income stability - their combination better predicts repayment capacity than isolated features.  
3. Computing deviation from purpose-based average log-credit identifies outliers (e.g., unusually large appliance loans). This complements purpose_target_encoded by adding continuous sizing context beyond approval rates.

3. <emp_duration_group_std><groupbythenstd><employment><duration><Job-specific duration variability, indicating employment stability's effect on repayment consistency.>

Reasoning:  
1. credit_hist_age_cross: Combines two critical risk factors (credit behavior and life stage) not currently interacted. Binning age first enables meaningful categorical interaction while avoiding numerical-categorical operations.  
2. savings_to_credit_ratio: Creates resource-to-debt metric by converting savings_status to numerical via label_encode (ordinal nature: no savings < ... < ≥1000 DM) then ratio with credit_amount. Avoids direct categorical arithmetic.  
3. emp_duration_group_std: Measures consistency of loan terms within employment groups. High std may indicate unstable income (e.g., short-term jobs with volatile loan durations), supplementing existing mean-based features.
