2025-08-16 18:35:15,978 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <CreditScore_Debt_Ratio><ratio><CreditScore><Debt><Calculate_ratio_between_CreditScore_and_Debt_as_a_new_feature_relationship_indicator_between_creditworthiness_and_outstanding_debt>
   
   Explanation: The ratio between CreditScore and Debt can provide insights into how much debt a person with a given credit score is managing. This might highlight instances where individuals have high credit scores relative to their debt levels, potentially indicating better financial management skills relevant to predicting credit card application success.

2. <Normalized_Age_Income_Ratio><zscore><Age_Income_Ratio><Apply_zscore_normalization_to_Age_Income_Ratio_to_standardize_and_improve_model_performance>

   Explanation: Since Age_Income_Ratio has a wide range, applying z-score normalization would standardize it. This could help in reducing skewness and making the feature distribution more uniform, improving model performance by ensuring that all features contribute equally.

3. <Age_Employed_Interaction><multiply><Age><Employed><Capture_interaction_between_Age_and_Employment_Status_by_multiplying_Age_and_Employed_features>

   Explanation: This feature will capture how employment status interacts with age, highlighting differences in behavior between different age groups and their employment status. This interaction can provide insights into people’s stability and long-term eligibility, factors crucial for predicting credit card approval success.
