2025-08-15 21:23:44,474 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for the KC1 software defect prediction task:

1. <complexity_density><divide><v(g)><loc><Cyclomatic complexity per line of code - may capture how concentrated complexity is in the code>
   - Reasoning: This creates a normalized measure of complexity relative to code size. High complexity density might indicate problematic code sections more likely to contain defects.

2. <halstead_effort_per_loc><divide><e><loc><Halstead effort per line of code - measures development effort density>
   - Reasoning: Effort (e) is already a composite Halstead metric. Normalizing it by loc could reveal modules where high effort is concentrated in few lines, potentially indicating problematic code.

3. <branch_complexity_ratio><divide><branchCount><v(g)><Ratio of actual branches to cyclomatic complexity - may reveal unusual control flow patterns>
   - Reasoning: Comparing the actual branch count to the theoretical maximum (v(g)) could identify modules with particularly complex or non-standard control flow structures that might harbor defects.

These features:
1. Create meaningful ratios between complexity metrics and size metrics
2. Normalize absolute metrics to be size-independent
3. Combine different metric types (McCabe and Halstead) to capture interactions
4. Focus on density measures that might better identify problematic code sections regardless of absolute size
5. Avoid operations that could create unstable features (like dividing by near-zero values) given the feature distributions shown

The features are designed to be interpretable while potentially capturing non-linear relationships that raw metrics might miss.

2025-08-15 21:28:17,777 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance, along with their reasoning:

1. <complexity_effort_interaction><multiply><complexity_density><halstead_effort_per_loc><Interaction between complexity density and effort per LOC - captures combined effect of complexity concentration and development effort density>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying these two features creates an interaction term that may reveal modules where high complexity concentration coincides with high effort density, which could be particularly prone to defects.

2. <log_halstead_volume><log><v><Log-transformed Halstead volume - reduces skewness and makes the heavy-tailed distribution more normal>
   - Reasoning: The Halstead volume (v) has a large range (0-7918.82) and is likely right-skewed. Log transformation can help normalize the distribution and make relationships more linear for the model.

3. <branch_complexity_deviation><subtract><branch_complexity_ratio><1.0><Deviation of branch complexity ratio from ideal value of 1 - measures unusual control flow patterns>
   - Reasoning: The ideal branch_complexity_ratio is 1.0 (where branches = cyclomatic complexity). This feature quantifies deviations from this ideal, which may indicate problematic control flow structures that could lead to defects.

These features were chosen because:
1. They create meaningful interactions/non-linear transformations of existing features
2. They address potential data distribution issues (skewness)
3. They encode domain knowledge about software complexity metrics
4. They maintain interpretability while potentially improving predictive power

The first feature combines two important complexity measures, the second handles data scaling issues, and the third captures deviations from an ideal software metric relationship - all of which could help a model better identify defect-prone modules.

2025-08-15 21:32:43,933 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance, along with their reasoning:

1. <log_halstead_effort_per_loc><log><halstead_effort_per_loc><Log-transform effort per LOC to handle skewness and heavy-tailed distribution>
   - Reasoning: The halstead_effort_per_loc feature has a large range (0-1897) with high std (168.88). Log transformation can normalize such skewed distributions, similar to how log_halstead_volume was created from v. This often helps linear models and distance-based algorithms.

2. <complexity_effort_ratio><divide><complexity_effort_interaction><halstead_effort_per_loc><Ratio of complexity-effort interaction to effort per LOC to measure efficiency>
   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio between the interaction term and its component (halstead_effort_per_loc) could reveal how much complexity is contributing relative to pure effort. Ratios often capture meaningful relationships in software metrics.

3. <rolling_avg_loc><rolling_mean><loc><5><5-module rolling average of LOC to capture local context>
   - Reasoning: Software modules often exist in context with nearby modules. A rolling average of LOC could help identify whether a module is unusually large/small compared to its neighbors, which might correlate with defect likelihood.

Additional notes:
- Avoided operations on categorical features since all features appear numerical
- Focused on transformations that address observed skewness (log) and create interpretable ratios
- Included a contextual feature (rolling) that might capture development patterns
- All operations are feasible given the data types and ranges shown

2025-08-15 21:36:52,897 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance, along with their reasoning:

1. <complexity_effort_norm><divide><complexity_effort_interaction><halstead_effort_per_loc><Normalized complexity-effort interaction by effort per LOC to better compare across modules>  
   - Reasoning: This creates a standardized measure of how much complexity is contributing to effort relative to the baseline effort per LOC. It helps identify modules where complexity is disproportionately high compared to their effort.

2. <log_cyclomatic_complexity><log><v(g)><Log-transform of cyclomatic complexity to handle skewness and extreme values>  
   - Reasoning: Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) often has a right-skewed distribution. Log-transforming it can make the feature more normally distributed, which is beneficial for many ML models.

3. <branch_density><divide><branchCount><loc><Ratio of branch count to LOC to measure control flow density>  
   - Reasoning: This captures how branch-heavy a module is relative to its size. High branch density might correlate with defect-proneness, as complex control flow can lead to more bugs.

Each of these steps addresses a different aspect of the data: normalization, skewness handling, and density metrics. They are chosen to enhance interpretability and model performance by creating more robust or informative features.

2025-08-15 21:41:09,581 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for KC1 software defect prediction:

1. <complexity_effort_norm_squared><square><complexity_effort_norm><Squared normalized complexity-effort interaction to amplify the effect of high complexity modules which are more likely to contain defects>

Reasoning: Squaring the normalized complexity-effort interaction will emphasize modules with higher complexity values, which are more likely to be defect-prone. This non-linear transformation can help the model better capture the relationship between complexity and defects.

2. <log_branch_density_ratio><log><branch_density><Log transform of branch density to handle skewness and extreme values in control flow density measure>

Reasoning: The branch density feature likely has a skewed distribution (as seen with other complexity measures). A log transform will normalize the distribution and make the feature more suitable for linear models while maintaining the relative ordering of values.

3. <rolling_complexity_ratio><rolling_mean><complexity_density><5><5-point rolling average of complexity density to capture local trends in code complexity>

Reasoning: A rolling average of complexity density can help identify modules that are part of consistently complex code sections, which may be more prone to defects. The window size of 5 provides a reasonable local context without being too broad.

These transformations were chosen because:
1. They focus on complexity-related features which are known to correlate with defect proneness
2. They address common data issues like skewness and scale differences
3. They create features that maintain interpretability while potentially improving predictive power
4. They avoid operations that could introduce instability (like division by small numbers)

2025-08-15 21:45:00,967 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for software defect prediction:

1. <complexity_effort_weighted><multiply><complexity_effort_interaction><branchCount><Weighted interaction between complexity effort and branch count, as modules with both high complexity and many branches are more defect-prone>

Rationale: This creates a feature that captures the combined effect of code complexity and control flow complexity (branch count), which are both known to correlate with defect likelihood. The multiplicative interaction may reveal non-linear relationships.

2. <log_halstead_volume_diff><diff><log_halstead_volume><rolling_avg_loc><Difference between log Halstead volume and rolling average LOC to identify modules whose complexity deviates from their size trend>

Rationale: This helps identify modules that are unusually complex for their size, which might indicate problematic code. The log transformation ensures the difference is on a comparable scale.

3. <branch_complexity_rolling><rolling_mean><branch_complexity_ratio><5><5-point rolling mean of branch complexity ratio to smooth local variations and identify sustained complexity patterns>

Rationale: Rolling averages help identify persistent complexity patterns rather than single-point anomalies. A 5-point window provides enough context without being too sensitive to local fluctuations.

These features target different aspects of defect prediction:
1. Combines two known risk factors (complexity and branching)
2. Identifies anomalous complexity patterns
3. Smooths complexity metrics to find sustained issues
All maintain interpretability while potentially capturing non-linear relationships that simple features might miss.

2025-08-15 21:49:12,782 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps that could improve the downstream model's performance for KC1 software defect prediction:

1. <complexity_density_squared><square><complexity_density><Squaring complexity_density to amplify the effect of high complexity-density modules which are more likely to contain defects>

Reasoning: The complexity_density feature already shows some predictive power (mean=0.2662, range up to 1.27). Squaring this value will emphasize modules with higher complexity density while shrinking values below 1, potentially creating better separation between defect-prone and clean modules.

2. <log_halstead_effort><log><e><Log transform of Halstead effort to handle its extreme right-skewed distribution (range 0-324803) and make relationships more linear>

Reasoning: The 'e' (Halstead effort) feature has an extremely wide range and high standard deviation (mean=5531, std=18347). A log transform will normalize this distribution and may reveal more meaningful relationships with defect occurrence, as very high effort values are likely defect predictors but currently dominate the scale.

3. <branch_complexity_interaction><multiply><branchCount><branch_complexity_ratio><Interaction term between raw branch count and complexity ratio to capture modules with both many branches and high complexity>

Reasoning: Both branchCount and branch_complexity_ratio are related to control flow complexity. Their interaction may better identify modules where the combination of many decision points (branches) and complex branching patterns makes defects more likely, capturing more nuanced complexity than either feature alone.

These transformations address:
- Non-linear relationships via squaring and log transforms
- Interaction effects between related complexity measures
- Handling of extreme value distributions
All while working within the provided operator set and maintaining interpretability of the features.

2025-08-15 21:54:23,805 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the downstream model's performance for KC1 software defect prediction:

1. <complexity_effort_interaction_sqrt><sqrt><complexity_effort_interaction><Square root of complexity_effort_interaction to reduce skewness and handle extreme values>  
   - Reasoning: The complexity_effort_interaction feature has a high range (0-509) and std (34.8). Taking the square root will compress the scale while preserving the ordinal relationship, making it more suitable for models sensitive to feature scales.

2. <halstead_effort_per_loc_log><log><halstead_effort_per_loc><Log transform of halstead_effort_per_loc to normalize distribution>  
   - Reasoning: halstead_effort_per_loc is right-skewed (range 0-1897, mean=92.6, Q3=109.5). Log transform helps normalize such distributions and can reveal non-linear relationships that linear models might miss.

3. <branch_rolling_complexity_ratio><multiply><branch_complexity_ratio><rolling_complexity_ratio><Interaction between branch and rolling complexity ratios to capture combined effects>  
   - Reasoning: Both features measure different aspects of code complexity. Their interaction might reveal synergistic effects where certain combinations of branching and rolling complexity are particularly indicative of defects.

These transformations address:
- Skewed distributions (sqrt and log transforms)
- Extreme value scaling
- Potential interaction effects
- Making features more suitable for linear models while preserving information

The operations were chosen to:
1. Maintain interpretability
2. Handle the heavy-tailed distributions present in many features
3. Create meaningful interactions between related code metrics
4. Avoid operations that could introduce instability (like division by near-zero values)

2025-08-15 21:58:10,649 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the KC1 defect prediction model, leveraging interactions, transformations, and complexity measures:

1. <complexity_effort_interaction_log><log><complexity_effort_interaction><Log transform of complexity_effort_interaction to further normalize its heavily skewed distribution>
   - Reasoning: The complexity_effort_interaction feature has extreme values (max=509.96) and high std (34.85). A log transform after the initial sqrt transform could better handle the long tail and make the feature more Gaussian-like, which often benefits linear models and distance-based algorithms.

2. <branch_rolling_complexity_weighted><multiply><branch_rolling_complexity_ratio><e><Weighted interaction of branch/rolling complexity with Halstead effort to capture cost of complexity>
   - Reasoning: Combining the already engineered branch_rolling_complexity_ratio with Halstead's effort (e) creates a feature that reflects how much computational cost is associated with each unit of combined complexity. This may better highlight modules where complex control flow coincides with high implementation effort.

3. <halstead_effort_loc_rolling><rolling_mean><halstead_effort_per_loc><5><Smoothed Halstead effort per LOC using 5-sample rolling mean to identify localized effort trends>
   - Reasoning: A rolling mean on halstead_effort_per_loc could reveal whether a module is part of a broader high-effort region in the codebase (which may correlate with defect density), while reducing noise from individual module variations. The window size of 5 is a starting heuristic assuming localized similarity.

These steps focus on:
1) Further normalizing extreme-valued features
2) Creating meaningful interactions between complexity and effort metrics 
3) Introducing contextual information through rolling operations
All while avoiding operations that could amplify noise or violate assumptions of downstream models.

2025-08-15 22:01:22,444 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to improve the KC1 defect prediction model, leveraging the available operators and considering the nature of software metrics:

1. <branch_rolling_complexity_weighted_log><log><branch_rolling_complexity_weighted><Log transform of weighted complexity to handle extreme skewness in high-effort modules>
   - Reasoning: The branch_rolling_complexity_weighted feature has a massive range (0 to 203k) and high std (10144). Log transformation can normalize its distribution, making it more interpretable for models sensitive to scale (e.g., logistic regression) and reducing the influence of outliers.

2. <halstead_effort_loc_smoothed><rolling_mean><halstead_effort_per_loc><5><5-sample rolling mean of effort per LOC to capture localized trends>
   - Reasoning: While halstead_effort_loc_rolling exists, applying rolling mean directly to the base halstead_effort_per_loc with a different window size (5) may reveal additional localized patterns in code effort that correlate with defects, especially in modules with volatile effort metrics.

3. <complexity_effort_ratio_squared><square><complexity_effort_ratio><Amplify small ratios to highlight modules where complexity dominates effort>
   - Reasoning: Squaring the complexity_effort_ratio (currently range [0, 1.27]) will non-linearly emphasize values closer to 1 (where complexity ≈ effort) while pushing near-zero values closer to 0. This could help identify modules where complexity is disproportionately high relative to effort—a potential defect indicator.

Why These Steps?  
- Log Transforms: Address heavy-tailed distributions common in software metrics (e.g., effort, complexity).  
- Rolling Operations: Capture temporal/localized patterns in code properties that static metrics might miss.  
- Non-linear Scaling: Expose hidden relationships in ratios that linear models might overlook.  

Avoided division/cross operations due to lack of categorical features and potential instability from division by near-zero values in Halstead metrics.
