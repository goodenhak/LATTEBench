Task: KC1 Software defect prediction (module has/has not one or more reported defects). One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.

Features:

2025-08-15 23:04:10,809 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <log_loc><log><loc><Natural log of lines of code to reduce skewness and normalize distribution>
   - Reasoning: LOC shows high skewness (mean=21.05, median=10.0). Log transformation compresses scale, making relationships more linear and improving model performance for skewed data.

2. <branch_per_loc><ratio><branchCount><loc><Branch complexity density per line of code>
   - Reasoning: Absolute branch counts may not capture complexity density. This ratio standardizes complexity by size, potentially revealing defect-prone modules with concentrated complexity. For example, defective modules show higher ratios (0.15-0.2 vs 0.11 in non-defective).

3. <halstead_effort_complexity><multiply><e><v(g)><Interaction between Halstead effort and McCabe cyclomatic complexity>
   - Reasoning: Effort (e) and complexity (v(g)) are key defect predictors. Their product captures synergistic effects where high complexity amplifies effort-related defects. Defective examples show high values (e.g., 49456*8=395k vs non-defective 1867*2=3.7k).

2025-08-15 23:13:03,769 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the analysis of the KC1 software defect prediction dataset, I propose these three feature engineering steps targeting key improvement areas: skewness reduction, code quality signal enhancement, and non-linear relationship capture:

1. Skewness reduction for Halstead volume  
   <sqrt_v><sqrt><v><Square root transform of Halstead volume to reduce right-skewness (std=530.98, max=7918.82)>  
   *Reasoning*: The 'v' (Halstead volume) exhibits extreme positive skew (mean=269, std=531). Square root transformation compresses the long tail while preserving zero-values, making the distribution more Gaussian-like for linear models.

2. Code documentation efficiency metric  
   <comment_ratio><divide><lOComment><total_Op><Ratio of comments to total operators indicating documentation efficiency>  
   *Reasoning*: Absolute comment counts (lOComment) are sparse (median=0). Normalizing by total operators creates a density measure that may correlate with code maintainability better than raw counts.

3. Complexity interaction term  
   <complexity_saturation><multiply><v(g)><iv(g)<Interaction between cyclomatic and design complexity>  
   *Reasoning*: Both v(g) (cyclomatic) and iv(g) (design) complexities measure control flow intricacy. Their multiplicative interaction may amplify signals for modules where high combined complexity exceeds defect-prediction thresholds.

These transformations specifically address:
- High-skew features degrading model convergence (sqrt_v)
- Underutilized sparse features via meaningful normalization (comment_ratio)
- Synergistic complexity effects not captured by existing features (complexity_saturation)

Output format:
