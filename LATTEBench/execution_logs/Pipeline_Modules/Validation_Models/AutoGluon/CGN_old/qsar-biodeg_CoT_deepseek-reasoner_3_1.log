### Reasoning:
1. O_plus_N: Combining oxygen and nitrogen counts (both key heteroatoms in biodegradation) may reveal synergistic effects that individual counts miss, as these atoms often participate in rate-determining reactions.  
2. sqrt_nCIR: nCIR has high skew (mean=1.44, std=6.0, max=147). Square root mitigates skew while preserving zero values (common in molecular features).  
3. SpMax_L_times_J_Dz_e: Multiplies topological descriptors SpMax_L (molecular connectivity) and J_Dz(e) (electronegativity distribution). This interaction may capture complex electronic-topological relationships affecting biodegradability.  

*Note: All operations avoid constants (unavailable per constraints) and focus on interpretable, non-redundant transformations.*

3. <has_halogen><greater><nX><0><Binary indicator for presence of any halogen atoms (nX > 0)>

Reasoning:  
- sqrt_F04_C_N: F04[C-N] is highly skewed (mean=1.09, std=2.58, max=36). Square root transformation reduces skewness while preserving zeros, improving linear model compatibility.  
- nO_times_nN: Oxygen and nitrogen often participate in biodegradation pathways. Their multiplicative interaction may reveal non-linear synergies not captured by O_plus_N.  
- has_halogen: Halogens (nX) inhibit biodegradation. Converting to binary simplifies detection of their presence/absence effect, as 75% of samples have nX=0 (Q3=0).

2025-08-16 06:01:37,007 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <halogen_nitro_interaction><multiply>has_halogen,nArNO2<Interaction between halogen presence and aromatic nitro group count>
   - Reasoning: Combines two chemical characteristics that may synergistically impact biodegradability. Halogens and nitro groups both reduce biodegradation rates, and their co-occurrence could indicate particularly persistent compounds.

2. <oxygen_to_nitrogen_ratio><divide>nO,nN_plus1<Ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms with Laplace smoothing (+1)>
   - Reasoning: Relative abundance of oxygen vs nitrogen influences molecular polarity and biodegradation pathways. Adding 1 avoids division by zero when nitrogen=0 while preserving ratio interpretation for positive counts.

3. <C_perc_square><square>C%<Squared carbon percentage to capture non-linear effects>
   - Reasoning: Carbon content likely has U-shaped relationship with biodegradability (low: insufficient energy, high: complex chains). Squaring amplifies deviation from mean and reveals quadratic patterns.

Reasoning:  
- Me_sq: Electronegativity (Me) influences molecular reactivity. Squaring may reveal optimal mid-range values for biodegradation.  
- nO_times_nCb-: Combines oxygen availability (degradation agent) with aromatic carbons (persistent structures). Their product may indicate breakdown potential.  
- O_minus_N: Highlights the net oxidizing capacity by subtracting inhibitory nitrogen atoms from oxygen atoms, as N-containing groups often resist degradation.  

Avoided operations on categoricals and division (due to zero counts in nN). Focused on nonlinear terms and structural/chemical interactions critical for biodegradability prediction.

### Reasoning:
1. Me_times_Mi: Multiplying mean electronegativity (Me) and ionization potential (Mi) creates a feature capturing synergistic electronic effects that may influence molecular stability and biodegradability. Both properties scale with electron density, and their product may reveal non-linear relationships missed by linear models.
   
2. nitro_halogen_interaction: Aromatic nitro groups (nArNO2) and halogens (nX) are structural moieties that inhibit biodegradation. Their multiplicative interaction amplifies signal for compounds where both features co-occur (e.g., toxic pollutants), potentially improving class separation.

3. sqrt_F03_C_O: F03[C-O] (range [0,40], mean=3.63, std=4.60) is right-skewed (Q1=0, Q3=6). Square root transformation compresses extreme values, normalizes the distribution, and preserves interpretability of oxygen-related bonds critical for biodegradation pathways.

2025-08-16 06:20:07,065 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. Label encoding for halogen presence:  
   <has_halogen_num><label_encode><has_halogen><Converts categorical has_halogen to numerical (0=False, 1=True) for arithmetic operations>  
   *Reasoning*: has_halogen is categorical, limiting interactions. Converting to numerical enables multiplicative operations with other features (e.g., halogen-inhibitor interactions).

2. Ratio of electronegativity to ionization potential:  
   <Me_div_Mi><divide><Me><Mi><Ratio of mean Sanderson electronegativity to mean ionization potential, capturing electronic properties>  
   *Reasoning*: Me and Mi are scaled electronic properties. Their ratio may reveal electronic imbalances affecting biodegradability, complementing the existing product feature (Me_times_Mi).

3. Binary indicator for C-O bonds at distance 3:  
   <F03_CO_present><greater><F03[C-O]><0><1 if C-O bonds exist at topological distance 3, else 0>  
   *Reasoning*: F03[C-O] is skewed (mean=3.63, max=40). A binary version simplifies the signal (presence/absence), which may correlate better with biodegradation than raw counts.

### Additional Insights:
- Avoided Constants: Used greater with 0 (allowed per operators) for binarization without creating a constant feature.
- Interaction Potential: has_halogen_num enables future interactions (e.g., with nArNO2).
- Skew Mitigation: Binary F03_CO_present addresses skew more effectively than transformations like sqrt_F03_C_O.

3. <mean_SdO_by_nO><groupbythenmean><nO><SdO><Average dO E-state per oxygen atom count to normalize electronic effects>

### Reasoning:
1. Skew Reduction for nCb-:  
   The nCb- feature (substituted benzene carbons) has high skew (mean=1.65, std=2.32, max=18). Applying sqrt compresses extreme values, making distributions more symmetric. This helps linear models capture relationships with biodegradability better.

2. Halogen-Carbon Interaction:  
   Halogens (via has_halogen) inhibit biodegradation, especially in carbon-rich compounds. Multiplying C% (carbon percentage) by the binary has_halogen creates an interaction term that highlights compounds where high carbon content combines with halogen presence—a known persistence factor.

3. Group Normalization for SdO:  
   SdO (sum of dO E-states) correlates with oxygen count (nO). Grouping by nO and averaging SdO creates a feature representing typical electronic influence per oxygen atom, reducing noise and emphasizing oxygen's role in biodegradation pathways.

### Reasoning:
1. SpMax_A_sq: The Lovasz-Pelikan index (SpMax_A) measures molecular branching complexity. Squaring this feature may reveal non-linear biodegradability relationships, as extreme values could indicate structural properties affecting persistence.
2. has_halogen_target: Target encoding the categorical has_halogen leverages target correlation directly. Halogens often hinder biodegradation, and this encoding quantifies their class-specific impact while handling the categorical nature.
3. Me_Mi_diff: Electronegativity (Me) and ionization potential (Mi) influence molecular reactivity. Their absolute difference may identify electronic imbalance affecting decomposition pathways, complementing existing ratio/multiplication features.

2025-08-16 06:44:48,658 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <F03_CO_present_target><target_encoding><F03_CO_present><Target encoding for C-O presence at distance 3 to capture biodegradability association>
   Reasoning: Target encoding leverages target information to represent categorical features, which may reveal hidden relationships between C-O bonds and biodegradability that one-hot encoding misses. This complements existing target encoding (has_halogen_target).

2. <SdO_per_heavy_atom><divide><SdO><nHM><Sum of dO E-states per heavy atom, normalizing oxygen contribution by molecular size>
   Reasoning: Heavy atom count (nHM) provides molecular scale context. Dividing SdO (oxygen electron state) by nHM creates a density metric that may better correlate with biodegradation than raw sums, especially for small/large molecules.

3. <log_nCIR_plus1><log><nCIR_plus1><Log-transform of circuit count with +1 smoothing to handle skewness>
   Reasoning: nCIR is highly skewed (mean=1.4, std=6.0). Log(x+1) transformation reduces skew while preserving zero-values, potentially improving linear model performance. This complements existing sqrt_nCIR by offering alternative scaling.
