2025-08-16 16:33:26,878 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Ethnicity_te><target_encoding><Ethnicity><Target encoding of Ethnicity based on application success rate>
   Reasoning: Target encoding transforms categorical variables into numerical values representing the mean target value per category. This captures predictive relationships between ethnicity and credit card approval likelihood while reducing high-cardinality issues compared to one-hot encoding.

2. <Debt_to_Income><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio of debt to income (scaled) indicating financial burden>
   Reasoning: Debt-to-income ratio is a crucial financial health indicator. Since both features are numerical and pre-scaled, their ratio may reveal applicants' ability to manage debt relative to earnings, potentially non-linear relationships with approval chances.

3. <ZipCode_risk><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><PriorDefault><Mean prior default rate by ZipCode indicating geographical risk patterns>
   Reasoning: Grouping prior defaults by zip code creates a contextual feature that captures neighborhood-level credit risk. This aggregates sparse individual default data into meaningful geographical trends that may influence approval decisions.

3. <mean_debt_by_zip><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Debt><Average debt level within zip code area>

### Reasoning:
1. relative_income_flag: 
   - Compares individual income (Income) against neighborhood benchmark (mean_income_by_zip). 
   - Applicants earning above local average may have better repayment capacity. 
   - Uses greater operator for binary output (1 if above average, 0 otherwise), avoiding division issues.

2. Employed_Married_BankCustomer: 
   - Combines three stability indicators (employment, marriage, banking) into a single feature. 
   - Multiplies existing Employed_Married (employment + marriage) with BankCustomer status. 
   - Captures synergistic effects – employed married bank customers likely represent low-risk applicants.

3. mean_debt_by_zip: 
   - Groups by ZipCode to compute average debt (Debt) per area. 
   - Reveals regional debt patterns – high average debt may indicate economic stress zones. 
   - Enables future features like debt relativity (individual vs. area average). 

These features address key risk dimensions: income relativity, stability synergy, and geographic debt trends.

### Reasoning:
1. Relative Debt by Zip Code: 
   - Divides individual debt (Debt) by zip-level average (mean_debt_by_zip). 
   - Captures whether an applicant's debt is above/below local norms, which may influence risk assessment beyond absolute values.

2. PriorDefault-BankCustomer Interaction: 
   - Multiplies PriorDefault (historical risk) and BankCustomer (financial stability). 
   - Highlights high-risk applicants with banking access (potential for deeper debt issues) versus unbanked defaults.

3. Log-Income Volatility by Zip: 
   - Applies log transform to std_income_by_zip (income variability within zip codes). 
   - Compresses extreme values (std range=0-7k+) into normal distribution, exposing neighborhood economic instability that affects creditworthiness.

### Reasoning:
1. Employed_Income: 
   - Multiplies binary employment status (Employed) with scaled income (Income). 
   - Captures synergy where income has stronger predictive power when applicant is employed (e.g., stable income vs. unemployment benefits). 
   - Avoids improper categorical operations since both features are numerical.

2. CreditScore_deviation_citizen: 
   - Subtracts group-mean credit score (mean_CreditScore_by_Citizen) from individual CreditScore. 
   - Highlights applicants under/over-performing relative to their citizenship group, potentially revealing hidden risk patterns (e.g., cultural borrowing differences).

3. high_relative_debt: 
   - Flags applicants with debt above their zip code average (relative_debt_zip > 1.0) using a binary threshold. 
   - Simplifies the continuous relative_debt_zip into an interpretable risk indicator for localized over-leverage, complementary to existing debt features.

Reasoning:  
1. BankCustomer_Married: Combines two binary stability indicators (bank access and marriage) to capture synergistic effects on creditworthiness.  
2. zscore_income_zip: Standardizes income within zip codes using existing deviation/std features to better compare applicants across regions.  
3. mean_log_DTI_by_zip: Creates a geographic baseline for debt burden (log-scaled) to enable deviation features in subsequent steps.

2025-08-16 17:11:31,790 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <PriorDefault_Employed><multiply><PriorDefault><Employed><Interaction between prior default and employment status, indicating high-risk subgroup when both are true>

3. <Married_Employed><multiply><Married><Employed><Interaction between marital and employment status, indicating household stability>

Reasoning:  
1. PriorDefault × Employed: Combines two critical risk factors. Unemployed applicants with prior defaults represent extreme risk, while employed defaulters may have partial mitigation. Multiplication creates a binary interaction flag.  
2. log DTI Deviation: Highlights applicants with debt burdens significantly different from their zip code average. High deviations may indicate unusual financial behavior not captured by absolute values.  
3. Married × Employed: Joint marital and employment status may signal financial stability. Married employed applicants likely have dual incomes, reducing default risk synergistically.  

Note: All operations avoid categorical arithmetic, use existing numerical features, and introduce non-redundant interactions targeting risk subgroups.
