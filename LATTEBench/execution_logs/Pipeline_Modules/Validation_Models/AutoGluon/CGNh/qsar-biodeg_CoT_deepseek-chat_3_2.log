   Reasoning: Combining the count of heavy atoms and oxygen atoms could capture the overall molecular size and oxygenation level, both important factors for biodegradation potential.

2. <C_percent_sqrt><sqrt><C%><Square root transformation of carbon percentage to normalize distribution and reduce skewness.>
   Reasoning: The carbon percentage (C%) has a wide range (0-60) and sqrt transformation can help handle potential non-linearity and make the feature more normally distributed for better model performance.

3. <nHDon_nN_ratio><ratio><nHDon><nN><Ratio of hydrogen bond donors to nitrogen atoms, indicating potential for specific biochemical interactions.>
   Reasoning: This ratio could capture the relationship between hydrogen bonding capacity and nitrogen content, both of which are important for molecular interactions in biological systems during biodegradation.

2025-08-25 21:07:12,626 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nHM_nCp_plus><plus><nHM><nCp><Sum of heavy atoms and terminal primary carbons, representing molecular complexity and branching.>
   - Reasoning: Combining the number of heavy atoms (nHM) and terminal primary carbons (nCp) may capture both molecular size and terminal group presence, which could affect biodegradation pathways. This additive feature might reveal interactions not captured by individual features.

2. <C_percent_nO_cross><cross><C%><nO><Interaction between carbon percentage and oxygen count, indicating oxidation state relative to carbon content.>
   - Reasoning: The percentage of carbon atoms (C%) and the number of oxygen atoms (nO) are both important for biodegradability. Their cross product could highlight compounds with high carbon but low oxygen (less biodegradable) vs low carbon but high oxygen (more biodegradable).

3. <SdO_abs><abs><SdO><Absolute value of Sum of dO E-states to handle negative values and focus on magnitude of oxygen electronic state.>
   - Reasoning: SdO has negative values (range [-5.256, 4.722]), which might distort models. Taking the absolute value focuses on the magnitude of the electronic state, which could be more predictive, while preserving the information about oxygen's role.

2025-08-25 21:10:43,336 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_nN_plus><plus><nO><nN><Sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms, representing total heteroatoms that may influence biodegradation through hydrogen bonding and polarity.>
   - Reasoning: Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are key heteroatoms that can form hydrogen bonds and increase water solubility, which often correlates with biodegradability. Summing them provides a simple measure of heteroatom content that may capture synergistic effects.

2. <C_percent_nHDon_cross><cross><C%><nHDon><Interaction between carbon percentage and hydrogen bond donors, indicating how carbon content moderates the effect of H-bonding capacity on biodegradability.>
   - Reasoning: Carbon percentage represents the hydrocarbon character, while nHDon represents potential for hydrogen bonding. Their interaction may reveal whether H-bonding is more important in high-carbon or low-carbon compounds for biodegradation.

3. <SdO_reciprocal><reciprocal><SdO><Reciprocal transformation of Sum of dO E-states to handle extreme values and emphasize small values which may correspond to critical oxygen electronic states.>
   - Reasoning: SdO has a right-skewed distribution (mean=9.03, but Q3=12.34 and max=71.17). The reciprocal transformation reduces the influence of extreme values and may reveal non-linear relationships with biodegradability.

2025-08-25 21:14:23,231 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and the rejected features so far, I need to create features that capture meaningful chemical interactions and transformations that could improve biodegradability prediction. Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps:

1. <nO_nN_ratio><ratio><nO><nN><Ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms, indicating the relative abundance of these heteroatoms which play crucial roles in biochemical degradation processes.>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms could reveal important biochemical properties since oxygen-rich compounds might be more easily oxidized while nitrogen-rich compounds might resist degradation or require specialized enzymatic pathways.

2. <SpMax_L_SpMax_B_m_diff><diff><SpMax_L><SpMax_B(m)><Difference between leading eigenvalues from Laplace matrix and Burden matrix weighted by mass, capturing structural information from different molecular representations.>
   - Reasoning: Different matrix representations (Laplace vs Burden weighted by mass) capture complementary structural information. Their difference might reveal subtle molecular properties that affect biodegradability.

3. <C_percent_nHDon_multiply><multiply><C%><nHDon><Product of carbon percentage and hydrogen bond donors, representing how carbon content interacts with hydrogen bonding capacity to influence biodegradation.>
   - Reasoning: This interaction term could capture how the carbon backbone structure moderates the effect of hydrogen bonding sites, which are critical for enzymatic recognition and degradation processes.

These features focus on meaningful chemical interactions, heteroatom ratios, and complementary structural information from different molecular descriptors.

Reasoning:
1. The nO_nN_ratio has an extremely wide range (0 to 12M) with high skewness. Log transformation will compress this range and create a more normal distribution, making it easier for models to learn from this feature without being dominated by outliers.

2. The SpMax_L_SpMax_B_m_diff has both positive and negative values. Taking the absolute value focuses on the magnitude of the structural difference between the two molecular representations, which might be more consistently predictive of biodegradability than the signed difference.

3. The C_percent_nHDon_multiply product has a right-skewed distribution (mean 32.3, max 220.8). Square root transformation will help normalize this distribution and reduce the impact of very large values while preserving the multiplicative relationship between carbon content and hydrogen bonding capacity.

2025-08-25 21:20:05,511 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_nN_ratio_log><log><nO_nN_ratio><Log transformation of oxygen to nitrogen ratio to handle extreme skewness and make the distribution more normal, improving model performance with linear algorithms>
   Reasoning: The nO_nN_ratio has an extremely wide range (0 to 12,000,000) with high standard deviation. A log transformation will compress this range dramatically, making the feature more suitable for machine learning models while preserving the relative ordering of values.

2. <C_percent_nHDon_multiply_sqrt><sqrt><C_percent_nHDon_multiply><Square root transformation of the carbon-hydrogen bond donor product to reduce right skewness and make the distribution more normal>
   Reasoning: The C_percent_nHDon_multiply feature has a range of 0-220.8 with Q1=0, Median=11.1, Q3=50.0, indicating right skewness. Square root transformation is effective for reducing skewness while maintaining interpretability of the interaction effect.

3. <SpMax_L_SpMax_B_m_diff_abs><abs><SpMax_L_SpMax_B_m_diff><Absolute value of eigenvalue difference to capture magnitude of structural discrepancy regardless of direction, which may be more predictive of biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The current difference feature ranges from -6.522 to 2.441, but the magnitude of the difference between these spectral properties (regardless of which is larger) might be more informative for predicting biodegradation patterns than the signed difference.

   Reasoning: The nO_nN_ratio_log still has a wide range (-13.8 to 16.3) with extreme values. Applying sigmoid will compress these values to a bounded range (0-1), which can help models like logistic regression and neural networks converge better and prevent outlier dominance.

Squaring it will emphasize larger differences more strongly, potentially revealing non-linear patterns where significant structural discrepancies between matrix representations are particularly predictive of biodegradability.

3. <C_percent_nHDon_multiply_log><log><C_percent_nHDon_multiply><Log transformation of carbon-hydrogen bond donor product to handle right skewness and extreme values, making the distribution more normal for linear models>
   Reasoning: The C_percent_nHDon_multiply has a range [0, 220.8] with right skewness (mean=32.3, Q3=50.0). Log transformation will help normalize the distribution and reduce the influence of extreme high values, making it more suitable for linear algorithms while maintaining the multiplicative relationship between carbon content and hydrogen bonding capacity.

2025-08-25 21:25:29,679 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_nN_ratio_log_sigmoid><sigmoid><nO_nN_ratio_log><Sigmoid transformation of log oxygen-nitrogen ratio to bound values between 0-1, making extreme values more manageable and improving performance with neural networks and logistic regression>
   - Reasoning: The nO_nN_ratio_log has extreme values (range from -13.8 to 16.3) which can be problematic for many models. Applying a sigmoid function will compress these values into a bounded range (0,1), making the feature more robust to outliers and potentially improving model performance.

2. <SpMax_L_SpMax_B_m_diff_abs_sqrt><sqrt><SpMax_L_SpMax_B_m_diff_abs><Square root transformation of absolute eigenvalue difference to reduce right skewness and make the distribution more normal while preserving the magnitude information>
   - Reasoning: The absolute difference feature has a range of [0.067, 6.522] with mean 1.15 and std 0.64, suggesting some right skewness. Square root transformation can help normalize the distribution while maintaining the interpretability of the magnitude differences.

3. <C_percent_nHDon_multiply_log><log><C_percent_nHDon_multiply><Log transformation of carbon-hydrogen bond donor product to handle right skewness and extreme values, making the distribution more suitable for linear models>
   - Reasoning: The C_percent_nHDon_multiply has a range of [0, 220.8] with mean 32.32 and std 41.99, indicating significant right skewness. Log transformation can help normalize this distribution and make the feature more effective for linear models while handling the zero values appropriately (log(1+x) would be needed for actual implementation).
