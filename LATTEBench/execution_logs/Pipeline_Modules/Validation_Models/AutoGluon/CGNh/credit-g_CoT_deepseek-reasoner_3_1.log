Reasoning:
1. Monthly burden (credit_amount/duration) captures repayment capacity - higher ratios may indicate higher default risk
2. Cross between checking and savings status may reveal combined financial stability patterns not visible individually
3. Grouping age by employment can show if certain employment categories have age-related risk patterns (e.g., young unemployed vs older employed)

Reasoning:
1. The credit-to-income ratio directly measures repayment burden relative to estimated capacity, which may be more predictive than absolute values. This builds on the existing disposable_income_estimate feature.
2. Employment duration and savings status both indicate financial stability. Their interaction may reveal nuanced risk patterns (e.g., long employment with low savings vs short employment with high savings).
3. Property ownership often correlates with creditworthiness. Grouping credit amounts by property type could reveal risk patterns associated with different asset levels (e.g., real estate owners vs those with no property).

Reasoning:
1. Log transforming credit_amount addresses its high skewness (mean=3289, std=2873) and helps normalize the distribution, which often improves performance for linear models and tree-based models handling skewed data.

2. Grouping duration by credit_history captures characteristic loan terms associated with different risk profiles (e.g., critical histories might have shorter durations), providing contextual duration information beyond raw values.

3. Crossing housing and property magnitude combines two stability indicators - current living situation and asset ownership - which may interact to create more meaningful risk segments than either feature alone.

<housing_property_interaction><cross><housing><property_magnitude><Interaction between housing type and property ownership, as living situation combined with asset ownership may reveal stability patterns affecting creditworthiness>

Reasoning:
1. The credit_burden_ratio directly measures financial strain by comparing monthly obligations to estimated income, which is a strong predictor of default risk. This improves upon existing disposable_income_estimate by creating a relative measure.
2. Mean_duration_by_history captures how different credit history types correlate with typical loan terms, potentially revealing risk patterns where certain histories are associated with longer/shorter repayment periods.
3. Housing_property_interaction combines two stability indicators that may have synergistic effects on credit risk, as property ownership might have different implications depending on housing situation.
