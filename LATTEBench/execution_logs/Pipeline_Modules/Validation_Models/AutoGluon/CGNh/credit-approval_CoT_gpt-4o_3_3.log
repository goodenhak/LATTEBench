2025-08-26 08:37:38,039 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<AgeDebtWeighted\><multiply><Age><Debt><BalancesAgeWithDebtToCaptureFinancialStress\>
   - Reasoning: This feature highlights the financial burden on individuals by considering the interaction between age and debt levels. Younger individuals with high debt may represent a different risk profile compared to older individuals with similar debt levels.

2. \<IncomeStability\><divide><YearsEmployed><Income><MeasuresStabilityByComparingEmploymentDurationToIncome\>
   - Reasoning: By comparing the number of years employed to the income, this feature gives insight into the stability of an individual's employment relative to their income. A low ratio could suggest instability, potentially impacting creditworthiness.

3. \<CreditScoreNormalized\><zscore><CreditScore><StandardizesCreditScoreToAdjustForSampleVariation\>
   - Reasoning: Utilizing Z-score normalization on the credit score helps in adjusting for any sample variation and allows the model to leverage standardized scores, enabling better comparison across individuals.

2025-08-26 08:41:09,775 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operations:

1. <IncomeNormalized><zscore><Income><StandardizesIncomeToAdjustForSampleVariation>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing the income can adjust for sample variations and possibly reveal underlying patterns related to income's influence on credit card application success. This feature might help the model to better learn relationships that are not immediately obvious when comparing incomes on their raw scale.

2. <DebtToEmployedYearsRatio><divide><Debt><YearsEmployed><EvaluatesDebtRelativeToEmploymentExperienceForBetterRiskAssessment>
   - Reasoning: An individual's debt in relation to their years of employment can be a strong indicator of financial responsibility and stability, which are critical factors in determining creditworthiness. This ratio can help highlight those who've been employed for longer yet maintain relatively lower levels of debt, signaling potentially higher creditworthiness.

3. <GenderMarriedCross><cross><Gender><Married><ExaminesInteractionBetweenGenderAndMaritalStatusInfluencingCreditApplications>
   - Reasoning: The combination of gender and marital status might have an interaction effect that influences credit card application success. Understanding this interaction could improve the model's ability to differentiate between individuals with varying levels of intrinsic and potential financial stability paths.

   Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the financial risk associated with having a bank account by multiplying it with the DebtIncomeRatio, as being a bank customer can influence financial behavior and access to credit.

2. <IncomePriorDefaultInteraction><multiply><Income><PriorDefault><ExploresInteractionBetweenIncomeLevelAndPriorDefaultsOnCreditApproval>  
   Reasoning: This feature examines the interaction between income levels and prior defaults, potentially influencing credit approval, as individuals with prior defaults and higher income might be assessed differently in credit risk evaluations.

2025-08-26 08:43:15,007 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <AgeIncomeRatio><ratio><Age><Income><Evaluatesfinancialmaturityandbuyingpower>
   - Reasoning: By creating a ratio between age and income, we aim to capture the balance between financial maturity (typically higher age) and buying power (typically higher income). This could help assess an individual's financial independence and creditworthiness.

2. <EmploymentCreditScoreCross><cross><Employed><CreditScore><Examinesinteractionbetweenemploymentstatusandcreditscoretohighlightriskandcreditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By crossing employment status with credit score, this feature can capture interaction effects that might reflect additional nuances related to financial stability and risk assessment, potentially improving our model’s predictive capability.

3. <IncomeEthnicityCross><cross><Income><Ethnicity><Analyzesimpactofincomeleveloncreditworthinessacrossdifferentethnicgroups>
   - Reasoning: This new feature assesses how income levels affect creditworthiness across various ethnic groups, enabling us to uncover differences in credit card application success that might be influenced by demographic factors and improving the model’s fairness and accuracy.

   Reasoning: This feature could highlight the role of past defaults combined with current income levels in affecting credit card application success, by examining whether those who defaulted previously at certain income levels have higher or lower success rates.

2. <AgeMarriedInteraction><cross><Age><Married><Analyzestheinteractionbetweenageandmaritalstatusontheprobabilityofcreditapproval>

   Reasoning: Analyzing age alongside marital status may help uncover patterns where certain age groups coupled with being married or single have different credit approval rates. Age often affects financial stability, while marital status might influence financial obligations and spending patterns.

3. <DebtCreditScoreInteraction><multiply><Debt><CreditScore><Capturesfinancialburdenrelativecreditratinghighlightingpotentialrisklevels>

   Reasoning: This feature aims to understand how outstanding debt levels in conjunction with one's credit score impact the likelihood of credit card approval. It can give insights into how well a customer manages their debts relative to their creditworthiness, helping to identify potentially risky applicants.

   - Reasoning: Integrating Debt and Employed status can potentially highlight the financial burden associated with being unemployed and crushing debt, or conversely, the positive association between employment and debt management.

2. \<IncomeAgeGroup\><bin>\<Income\>\<Age\>\<Groupstheagebasedonincomelevelstoexplorefinancialmaturity\>  
   - Reasoning: Binning Age based on Income levels might capture the economic life stages effectively, such as young high earners or older low earners, which might affect credit card application success.

3. \<MarriedCitizenCross\><cross>\<Married\>\<Citizen\>\<Examineshowmaritalstatusandcitizenshipinfluencecreditapplicationsoutcome\>  
   - Reasoning: Combining Married and Citizen might reveal interaction effects that differentiate risk profiles between various marital statuses and citizenship forms, potentially impacting credit approval decisions.
