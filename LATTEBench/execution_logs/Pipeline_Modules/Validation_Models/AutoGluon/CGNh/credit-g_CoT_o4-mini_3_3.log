3. <credit_amount_binned><bin><credit_amount><BinnedCreditAmount>

Reasoning:
- Aggregating average monthly payment by credit history captures systematic differences in instalment behavior across credit‐risk categories.
- Computing the standard deviation of duration per purpose highlights how lending terms vary by credit motive, potentially separating low‐ and high‐risk profiles.
- Binning the (skewed) credit amount creates a categorical proxy that can model non‐linear impacts of loan size on default probability.
