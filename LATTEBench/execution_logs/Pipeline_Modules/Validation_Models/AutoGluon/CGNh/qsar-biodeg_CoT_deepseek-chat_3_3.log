   Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms could capture the balance between these heteroatoms, which are often involved in biodegradation processes. Since both are numerical, a ratio is appropriate and might reveal interactions not captured by the individual features.

2. <nHDon_nO_plus_nN><plus><nHDon><nO><nN><Sum of hydrogen bond donors and oxygen and nitrogen atoms, as all can participate in H-bonding which affects biodegradability.>
   Reasoning: nHDon already counts N and O atoms that are H-bond donors, but adding the total nO and nN might capture additional context about the molecular environment. This aggregate feature could better represent the overall potential for hydrogen bonding, a key factor in biodegradation.

3. <C_percent_squared><square><C%><Squared carbon percentage to capture non-linear effects of carbon content on biodegradability.>
   Reasoning: The percentage of carbon atoms (C%) has a mean around 37% and a wide range (0-60.7). Squaring this feature could help model potential quadratic relationships, as very high or low carbon content might have disproportionate effects on biodegradability.

2025-08-25 21:32:59,569 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN><plus><nO><nN><Sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms, which may indicate total heteroatom content affecting biodegradability.>
   Reasoning: The sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (nO and nN) could capture the overall presence of heteroatoms, which are known to influence biodegradability. This aggregate feature might provide a more robust signal than individual counts.

2. <C_percent_times_nCp><multiply><C%><nCp><Interaction between carbon percentage and terminal primary carbon atoms, potentially indicating molecular branching and carbon content effects.>
   Reasoning: Multiplying carbon percentage (C%) by the number of terminal primary carbons (nCp) creates an interaction term that could capture synergistic effects between overall carbon content and molecular structure, which are both important for biodegradability.

3. <SdO_zscore><zscore><SdO><Z-score normalized sum of dO E-states to standardize the oxygen electronic state contribution.>
   Reasoning: Applying z-score normalization to SdO (Sum of dO E-states) helps in scaling this feature, which has a high standard deviation (11.6464), making it more suitable for models sensitive to feature scales, like logistic regression or neural networks.

   - Reasoning: Both oxygen atoms and hydrogen bond donors (N and O) are involved in hydrogen bonding, which can affect molecular interactions and biodegradability. Multiplying these features captures their synergistic effect.

2. <C_percent_sqrt><sqrt><C%><Square root of carbon percentage to reduce skewness and capture non-linear relationships with biodegradability.>
   - Reasoning: The carbon percentage (C%) has a wide range (0-60.7) and may have non-linear effects on biodegradability. Applying a square root transformation can help normalize the distribution and reveal underlying patterns.

3. <SdO_plus_SdssC><plus><SdO><SdssC><Sum of oxygen and carbon E-states, representing total electronic state contribution from these atoms.>
   - Reasoning: E-state descriptors (SdO and SdssC) encode electronic information that influences molecular reactivity. Summing them provides a combined measure of electronic effects from oxygen and carbon atoms, which may be relevant for biodegradation processes.

2025-08-25 21:42:09,013 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and the rejected features, I need to create features that capture meaningful chemical interactions and structural properties that could influence biodegradability. The rejected features had low importance, so I need to focus on more chemically relevant interactions.

1. <O_N_heteroatom_ratio><ratio><nO><nN><Ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms, important for understanding electron distribution and biodegradation potential since oxygen-rich compounds often degrade differently than nitrogen-rich ones.>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen is chemically significant as these heteroatoms play different roles in biodegradation pathways. Oxygen-rich compounds might be more readily oxidized, while nitrogen-rich compounds might have different degradation patterns.

2. <carbon_electronegativity_interaction><multiply><C%><Me><Interaction between carbon percentage and mean electronegativity, capturing how electron distribution affects molecular stability and biodegradability.>
   - Reasoning: Carbon content combined with electronegativity can indicate electron density distribution, which influences how susceptible a molecule is to enzymatic attack during biodegradation.

3. <oxygen_estate_normalized><zscore><SdO><Standardized sum of dO E-states to compare oxygen electronic contributions across molecules on a common scale.>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the oxygen E-states helps account for scale differences and makes this electronic property more comparable across diverse molecular structures, potentially revealing patterns in biodegradability.

These features focus on chemically meaningful interactions (heteroatom balance, electron distribution, and standardized electronic properties) that are likely to have stronger predictive power for biodegradability classification.

2025-08-25 21:44:52,988 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_to_nN_ratio><ratio><nO><nN><Ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms, which may indicate different biodegradation pathways due to heteroatom composition.>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms could be important since oxygen-rich compounds (like alcohols, carboxylic acids) are often more biodegradable than nitrogen-rich compounds (like amines, nitro groups). This captures the balance between these two important heteroatoms.

2. <C_percent_electronegativity><multiply><C%><Me><Interaction between carbon percentage and mean electronegativity, representing how electron distribution affects molecular stability and biodegradability.>
   - Reasoning: Carbon percentage alone might not capture electronic effects. Multiplying with mean electronegativity creates an interaction term that represents how electron-rich the carbon framework is, which could influence how enzymes interact with the molecule during biodegradation.

3. <oxygen_estate_normalized><zscore><SdO><Standardized sum of dO E-states to compare oxygen electronic contributions across molecules on a common scale, helping identify compounds with unusually high or low oxygen reactivity.>
   - Reasoning: The sum of dO E-states (SdO) has a wide range (0-71) with high standard deviation. Z-score normalization will help put this feature on a common scale, making it easier for models to learn patterns related to oxygen electronic properties.

2025-08-25 21:50:22,963 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and the rejected features, I can see that previous attempts focused on heteroatom ratios, carbon-electronegativity interactions, and E-state normalizations. The features that were rejected had very low feature importance scores (close to 0), suggesting they didn't provide meaningful predictive power.

Let me propose 3 new feature engineering approaches that focus on different molecular properties:

1. Molecular complexity and branching: Compounds with more complex structures and branching tend to be less biodegradable. We can create features that capture this complexity.
   
2. Electronic state interactions: Instead of just normalizing E-states, let's create interactions between different E-state components to capture electronic environment effects.

3. Topological descriptor combinations: Many features are topological descriptors - combining them might reveal structural patterns related to biodegradability.

Here are my 3 proposed feature engineering steps:

1. <molecular_complexity_index><multiply><nCIR><LOC><Product of circuit count and lopping centric index to capture molecular complexity and branching, which often correlates with reduced biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Both nCIR (number of circuits) and LOC (lopping centric index) measure molecular complexity. Their product could better capture the overall structural complexity that makes compounds resistant to biodegradation.

2. <electronic_state_imbalance><subtract><SdO><SdssC><Difference between oxygen and carbon E-states, representing the electronic environment imbalance that may affect molecular reactivity and biodegradation pathways>
   - Reasoning: The balance between oxygen and carbon electronic states could indicate how readily a compound might undergo oxidation or other biodegradation processes. This is more informative than just normalizing individual E-states.

3. <topological_electronic_interaction><multiply><SpMax_L><Me><Interaction between the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix and mean electronegativity, capturing how electronic properties influence molecular topology in relation to biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: SpMax_L is a key topological descriptor, and Me represents electronic properties. Their interaction might reveal how electronic environment affects molecular shape in ways relevant to biodegradation.

3. <oxygen_estate_normalized><zscore><SdO><Standardized sum of dO E-states to compare oxygen electronic contributions across molecules on a common scale, helping identify compounds with unusually high or low oxygen reactivity.>

Reasoning:
1. nO_nN_heteroatom_ratio: Oxygen-rich compounds often degrade differently than nitrogen-rich ones due to different metabolic pathways. This ratio captures this important balance that wasn't adequately represented in previous attempts.

2. carbon_electronegativity_interaction: The interaction between carbon content (C%) and electronegativity (Me) could reveal how electron distribution affects molecular stability - a key factor in biodegradability that wasn't captured by considering these features separately.

3. oxygen_estate_normalized: Standardizing the sum of dO E-states (SdO) helps identify compounds with extreme oxygen electronic contributions, which could indicate unusual reactivity patterns affecting biodegradation. The z-score transformation makes this feature more interpretable for machine learning models.

These features target different aspects of molecular properties: heteroatom composition, electronic properties, and standardized electronic state contributions, providing complementary information for the biodegradability classification task.

2025-08-25 21:56:21,003 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_nN_ratio_squared><square><nO_nN_ratio><Squared ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms to capture non-linear relationships in heteroatom balance that may affect biodegradability pathways>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen atoms has been explored, but squaring this ratio could reveal quadratic relationships where extreme values (very high or very low ratios) have disproportionate effects on biodegradability.

2. <electronegativity_ionization_interaction><multiply><Me><Mi><Interaction between mean electronegativity and mean ionization potential, capturing combined electronic effects that influence molecular stability and reactivity during biodegradation>
   - Reasoning: Both Me and Mi are scaled electronic properties that individually describe electron distribution. Their interaction may reveal synergistic effects on molecular properties relevant to biodegradation.

3. <topological_complexity_index><multiply><nCIR><SpMax_A><Product of circuit count and leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix to quantify molecular complexity through both cyclic structure and topological connectivity>
   - Reasoning: nCIR measures cyclic complexity while SpMax_A captures topological connectivity. Their product may better represent overall molecular complexity which often correlates with biodegradation resistance.
