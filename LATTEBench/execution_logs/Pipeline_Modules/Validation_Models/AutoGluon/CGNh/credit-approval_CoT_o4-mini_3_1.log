2025-08-26 08:57:06,493 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three next‐step feature ideas:

1. <IndustryDefaultRate><groupbythenmean><Industry><PriorDefault><Mean prior default rate per industry>  
   Reasoning: captures industry‐level risk propensities—some sectors may have systematically higher default rates.  

2. <ScoreIndustryRatio><ratio><CreditScore><IndustryCreditScoreMean><Credit score relative to industry mean>  
   Reasoning: measures how an individual’s credit quality deviates from their peers in the same industry.  

3. <CitizenEncoded><label_encode><Citizen><Encoded citizenship status>  
   Reasoning: converts categorical citizenship into numeric codes so the model can learn differing patterns by citizenship type.
