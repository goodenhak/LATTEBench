2025-08-26 09:32:19,924 - INFO - LLM Output: To capture remaining nonlinearities, reduce skew and incorporate group‐level approval patterns, we can:

1. Stabilize income’s heavy right skew so that each additional dollar has diminishing impact on approval odds.  
2. Standardize debt to center it and make its scale comparable across applicants.  
3. Leverage citizenship’s historical approval rates to encode group‐level behavioral differences.
