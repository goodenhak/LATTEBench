   Reasoning: Converting categorical 'checking_status' to numerical via label encoding allows linear models to utilize this important feature which likely has a strong relationship with credit approval.

2. <credit_amount_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio of credit amount to installment commitment as debt burden indicator>
   Reasoning: This creates a debt-to-income ratio feature which is a fundamental metric in credit scoring. Higher ratios indicate greater financial burden and higher risk of default.

3. <age_group><bin><age><Binned age into groups for non-linear relationship capture with credit approval>
   Reasoning: Age often has a non-linear relationship with credit risk. Binning allows the model to capture patterns where very young and very old applicants might have different risk profiles compared to middle-aged applicants.

2025-08-25 11:39:29,726 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <checking_status_encoded><label_encode><checking_status><Encoded checking_status to numerical for better model handling>
   Reasoning: Label encoding the checking_status categorical variable converts it to a numerical format that many machine learning models can handle more effectively. The status of the checking account is likely a strong indicator of financial stability and creditworthiness.

2. <credit_amount_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio of credit amount to installment commitment as debt burden indicator>
   Reasoning: This creates a debt-to-income ratio feature by dividing the credit amount by the installment commitment percentage. This ratio is a fundamental metric in credit scoring, representing the borrower's ability to handle the requested credit relative to their disposable income.

3. <age_group><bin><age><Binned age into groups for non-linear relationship capture with credit approval>
   Reasoning: Age often has a non-linear relationship with credit risk. Younger applicants may be higher risk due to limited credit history, while very old applicants may have different risk profiles. Binning allows the model to capture these patterns more effectively than using raw age.

2025-08-25 11:40:55,573 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <checking_status_encoded><label_encode><checking_status><Encoded checking_status to numerical for better model handling>
   - Reasoning: Label encoding converts categorical checking_status into numerical values, allowing linear models to better interpret the ordinal relationship between categories (e.g., no checking < <0 < 0<=X<200 < >=200 might indicate increasing financial stability).

2. <credit_amount_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio of credit amount to installment commitment as debt burden indicator>
   - Reasoning: This creates a debt burden metric. A higher ratio indicates the credit amount is large relative to disposable income, which might increase default risk. Installment_commitment represents % of disposable income, so dividing credit_amount by it approximates income-adjusted debt load.

3. <age_group><bin><age><Binned age into groups for non-linear relationship capture with credit approval>
   - Reasoning: Age often has a non-linear relationship with credit risk (e.g., very young and very old might be riskier). Binning captures these patterns better than raw age for models like logistic regression.

2025-08-25 11:42:29,811 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_per_month><divide><credit_amount><duration><Monthly credit amount to assess affordability>
   - Reasoning: Dividing the total credit amount by the loan duration gives a monthly payment estimate, which helps evaluate whether the borrower can handle the monthly financial burden. This is a strong indicator of credit risk.

2. <employment_status_risk><label_encode><employment><Encoded employment status to numerical based on risk level (unemployed=highest risk)>
   - Reasoning: Converting the employment categories to numerical values based on stability (e.g., unemployed=0, <1=1, 1<=X<4=2, 4<=X<7=3, >=7=4) captures the risk associated with job instability. More stable employment should correlate with higher credit approval.

3. <savings_to_credit_ratio><divide><savings_status_encoded><credit_amount><Ratio of encoded savings status to credit amount to measure financial buffer>
   - Reasoning: First encode savings_status numerically (e.g., no known savings=0, <100=1, 100<=X<500=2, 500<=X<1000=3, >=1000=4), then divide by credit amount. This indicates if savings are sufficient relative to the loan size, which is a key factor in credit decisions.

   Reasoning: This feature combines the affordability measure (credit_amount_per_month) with savings capacity (encoded savings_status) to create a ratio that indicates whether the monthly payment is substantial relative to the applicant's savings. A higher ratio suggests greater financial strain, which might increase default risk.

   Reasoning: Longer loan durations amplify the risk associated with unstable employment. By multiplying duration (months) by the employment risk score, we create a feature that accounts for both the length of the commitment and the applicant's employment stability, which should be predictive of creditworthiness.

3. <age_credit_amount_interaction><multiply><age><credit_amount><Interaction between age and credit amount to capture life stage financial behavior>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants with large credit amounts might be riskier due to less financial experience, while older applicants with similar amounts might be more stable. This interaction term helps the model capture these non-linear relationships that individual features might miss.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the raw monthly burden of the credit (without considering income percentage), which might be a more direct affordability measure than credit_amount_per_month. It could help the model better distinguish between long-term small payments and short-term large payments.

2. <employment_age_interaction><multiply><employment_status_risk><age><Interaction between employment risk and age to capture career stage risk profile>
   Reasoning: Employment risk might affect different age groups differently (e.g., unemployment is riskier for older applicants with fewer job prospects). This interaction could reveal nuanced patterns that the individual features alone might miss.

3. <savings_credit_ratio><divide><credit_amount><savings_status><label_encode><Ratio of credit amount to encoded savings status to measure credit request relative to savings capacity>
   Reasoning: Savings status indicates financial stability. Comparing credit amount to savings (encoded numerically) could show if someone is requesting credit beyond their means. The label_encode ensures proper numerical representation of savings categories.

   Reasoning: Younger applicants with high employment risk (unemployed) may represent different risk profiles than older unemployed applicants. This interaction captures non-linear relationships between age and employment status.

3. <savings_credit_ratio><divide><credit_amount><savings_status><label_encode><Ratio of credit amount to encoded savings status to measure credit request relative to savings capacity>
   Reasoning: Converting savings_status to numerical via label encoding allows creating a meaningful ratio that measures how much credit is being requested relative to the applicant's savings capacity, which is a strong indicator of financial stability.

   Reasoning: This feature combines the monthly credit payment with the installment commitment percentage to create a more comprehensive measure of monthly financial burden. This could better capture affordability constraints that influence credit approval decisions.

2. <employment_status_risk_times_age><multiply><employment_status_risk><age><Interaction between employment risk and age to capture risk profile across different life stages>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants with high employment risk might be riskier than older applicants with the same risk level. This interaction term captures the compounded effect of employment instability at different life stages, which could be predictive of creditworthiness.

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings account status to numerical values based on financial stability>
   Reasoning: Converting the categorical savings_status to numerical values through label encoding (likely ordered from lowest to highest savings) will allow linear models to better capture the ordinal relationship between savings levels and credit approval probability.

   Reasoning: This feature combines the monthly credit amount with the installment commitment (percentage of disposable income) to create a more direct measure of affordability. A higher ratio indicates greater financial strain, which should be predictive of credit denial.

2. <employment_age_risk_interaction><multiply><employment_status_risk><age><Interaction between employment risk and age to capture how risk profiles change with life stage>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants with high employment risk might be riskier than older applicants with the same risk level. This multiplicative interaction captures non-linear relationships between employment stability and age that could improve predictive power.

3. <savings_status_risk_score><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded savings status as numerical risk score (no savings=highest risk)>
   Reasoning: Converting the categorical savings_status to a numerical risk score (e.g., no known savings=4, <100=3, 100<=X<500=2, 500<=X<1000=1, >=1000=0) provides a more meaningful representation of financial stability that can be directly used by models.

   Reasoning: This feature multiplies the monthly credit amount by the duration to estimate the total financial obligation, which could be a strong predictor of default risk as larger total commitments may be harder to repay.

2. <checking_status_risk_score><label_encode><checking_status><Encoded checking status as numerical risk score (no checking=highest risk, >=200=lowest risk)>
   Reasoning: Converting the categorical checking_status to a numerical risk score based on financial stability (e.g., no checking = 4, <0 = 3, 0<=X<200 = 2, >=200 = 1) could help the model better capture the relationship between checking account status and creditworthiness.

3. <credit_utilization_ratio><divide><credit_amount><savings_status_risk_score><Ratio of credit amount to savings risk score to measure borrowing relative to savings safety net>
   Reasoning: This ratio assesses how much credit is being requested relative to the applicant's savings safety net (as measured by the risk score). Higher ratios may indicate over-leverage and higher default risk.
