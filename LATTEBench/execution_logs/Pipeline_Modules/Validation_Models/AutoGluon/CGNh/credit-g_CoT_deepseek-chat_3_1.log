   Reasoning: This feature captures the monthly repayment amount (credit_amount divided by duration in months), which is a direct indicator of the borrower's debt burden. A higher ratio may indicate higher risk of default, as it requires larger monthly payments relative to the loan amount.

2. <employment_age_interaction><cross><employment><age><Interaction between employment status and age to capture combined effect on creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Younger borrowers with stable employment may have different risk profiles than older borrowers with the same employment status. This interaction feature can capture non-linear relationships between age, employment stability, and credit risk that individual features might miss.

3. <savings_to_credit_ratio><ratio><savings_status><credit_amount><Ratio of savings status (encoded numerically) to credit amount, measuring financial buffer>
   Reasoning: First convert savings_status to numerical using label encoding, then create a ratio with credit_amount. This measures the borrower's financial cushion relative to the loan size - those with higher savings relative to the loan amount may be less risky.

2025-08-25 11:12:42,089 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_history_duration_interaction><cross><credit_history><duration><Interaction between credit history and loan duration to capture risk profile over time>
   Reasoning: Combining credit history (which indicates past repayment behavior) with loan duration can reveal how risk changes with time for different credit histories. For example, a long duration with a critical credit history might be riskier than a short duration with the same history.

2. <savings_age_ratio><ratio><savings_status><age><Ratio of savings status (encoded numerically) to age, indicating financial maturity and stability>
   Reasoning: Savings status (when label encoded) divided by age can approximate savings per year of life, which may correlate with financial responsibility. Older individuals with higher savings are likely more creditworthy.

3. <property_credit_interaction><cross><property_magnitude><credit_amount><Interaction between property magnitude and credit amount to assess collateral adequacy>
   Reasoning: Property type (e.g., real estate) might serve as collateral. Cross with credit amount can show if the loan is appropriately backed (e.g., high credit with real estate is safer than with no property).

   - Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a high standard deviation relative to its mean, indicating right-skewness. Applying a log transformation can normalize the distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of outliers.

2. <age_employment_interaction><cross><age><employment><Interaction between age and employment status to capture combined effect on income stability>
   - Reasoning: While employment_age_interaction exists, creating a direct cross between raw age and employment might capture different patterns. Age and employment status together can indicate career stage and income stability, which are important factors in creditworthiness assessment.

3. <savings_checking_interaction><cross><savings_status><checking_status><Interaction between savings and checking account status for comprehensive financial health assessment>
   - Reasoning: Both savings and checking accounts reflect an applicant's financial management. Their interaction might reveal patterns that individually they don't capture, such as someone with good savings but poor checking habits (or vice versa) indicating specific financial behaviors.

3. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings account status for comprehensive financial health assessment>

Reasoning:
1. The credit_amount feature has a high standard deviation (2873.98) relative to its mean (3289.64), indicating significant skewness. Applying a square root transformation will help normalize the distribution and make the feature more suitable for linear models while reducing the influence of extreme values.

2. Age and employment status are both important indicators of financial stability. Creating an interaction term between these features can capture non-linear relationships where the effect of age on creditworthiness depends on employment status (e.g., older unemployed individuals vs. younger employed individuals).

3. Checking and savings account status are both indicators of financial health and liquidity. Their interaction may reveal patterns that individual features cannot capture, such as someone with both poor checking and savings status being higher risk than someone with only one poor account status.

   - Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has high skewness (mean=3289, std=2873, Q3=3926) with a long right tail. Applying log transformation can normalize the distribution, making it easier for models to learn patterns and reducing the influence of outliers.

2. <age_employment_interaction><cross><age><employment><Interaction between age and employment status to capture combined effect on income stability and creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: While we already have employment_age_interaction, it's categorical and may not capture the full continuous relationship. Creating a numerical interaction (age × employment encoded numerically) can provide a more nuanced feature that captures how the combination of age and employment duration affects credit risk.

3. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings account status for comprehensive financial health assessment>
   - Reasoning: Checking and savings accounts represent different aspects of financial stability. Their interaction may reveal patterns not captured by individual features (e.g., someone with good checking but no savings vs. someone with poor checking but substantial savings). This could provide valuable signals for creditworthiness assessment.

   - Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has high variance (Std = 2873.9759) and is right-skewed (Mean = 3289.6 > Median = 2302.5). Applying log transformation can normalize the distribution and make the model less sensitive to extreme credit values, potentially improving prediction stability.

2. <age_employment_interaction><cross><age><employment><Interaction between age and employment status to capture combined effect on income stability and creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: While we have an employment_age_interaction feature, creating a direct cross between raw age and employment categories might capture different patterns. Age and employment status together provide stronger signals about financial stability than either feature alone, as older individuals with stable employment are generally better credit risks.

3. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings account status for comprehensive financial health assessment>
   - Reasoning: Both checking and savings accounts indicate financial stability. The interaction between these two financial indicators could reveal synergistic effects - for example, someone with both good checking and savings status is likely a much better credit risk than what either feature alone would suggest. This captures the combined financial health picture.

   - Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a high standard deviation (2873.98) relative to its mean (3289.64), indicating significant right skew. Applying a log transformation can normalize the distribution, making it easier for linear models to learn and reducing the influence of outliers.

2. <age_employment_interaction><cross><age><employment><Interaction between age and employment status to capture combined effect on income stability and creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: While employment_age_interaction exists, it's categorical and may not capture nuanced relationships. A numerical interaction between age (continuous) and employment (encoded as ordinal) could better represent how income stability (proxied by employment duration) changes with age, which is crucial for credit assessment.

3. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction between checking and savings account status for comprehensive financial health assessment>
   - Reasoning: Both checking and savings status are strong indicators of financial stability. Their interaction may reveal synergistic effects (e.g., poor checking but good savings vs. poor both) that individually encoded features might miss, providing a more holistic view of the applicant's financial health.

   Reasoning: This ratio captures the actual monthly payment amount relative to the borrower's disposable income commitment, which is a more direct measure of repayment capacity than the credit-to-duration ratio alone. It combines credit amount with installment commitment to assess affordability.

2. <age_credit_interaction><cross><age><credit_amount><Interaction between age and credit amount to capture risk profile differences across life stages>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants with large credit amounts may represent higher risk than older applicants with similar amounts. This interaction captures non-linear relationships between age and credit amount that could impact creditworthiness assessment.

3. <employment_residence_interaction><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment stability and residence stability for comprehensive stability assessment>
   Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Their interaction may reveal stronger patterns - applicants stable in both employment and residence likely represent lower risk than those unstable in both areas.

   - Reasoning: This creates a ratio that represents the monthly credit payment amount relative to the installment commitment percentage. A higher ratio indicates a heavier debt burden relative to income, which could be a strong predictor of credit default risk.

2. <age_credit_interaction><cross><age><credit_amount><Interaction between age and credit amount to capture risk profile differences across life stages>
   - Reasoning: Younger applicants with large credit amounts might represent higher risk due to limited financial history, while older applicants with similar amounts might be more stable. This interaction captures these non-linear relationships that individual features might miss.

3. <employment_residence_interaction><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment stability and residence stability for comprehensive stability assessment>
   - Reasoning: Both employment duration and residence duration are indicators of stability. Applicants with stable employment AND stable residence are likely better credit risks than those with instability in either area. This interaction captures the combined stability effect.
