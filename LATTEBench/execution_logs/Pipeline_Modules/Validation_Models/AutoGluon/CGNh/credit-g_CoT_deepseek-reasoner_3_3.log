3. <age_by_employment><groupbythenmean><employment><age><Mean age per employment category, capturing life stage patterns>

Reasoning:
1. Crossing checking and savings status creates interaction terms that may reveal non-linear patterns in financial stability better than individual features.
2. Monthly burden ratio directly relates to repayment capacity - a key factor in credit decisions that isn't explicitly captured in original features.
3. Grouping age by employment reveals typical age patterns within employment categories, which may correlate with income stability and creditworthiness.

   Reasoning: Certain purposes (e.g., business vs. car) may have different risk profiles depending on credit history. This interaction could reveal purpose-specific risk patterns that aren't captured by either feature alone.

2. <credit_to_existing_ratio><divide><credit_amount><existing_credits><Ratio of new credit amount to number of existing credits, indicating relative debt burden>
   Reasoning: The absolute credit amount matters less than its proportion to existing obligations. This ratio helps normalize the new credit by the borrower's current debt load at the bank.

3. <property_job><cross><property_magnitude><job><Combines property ownership and job type to assess stability through asset-employment interactions>
   Reasoning: The protective effect of property ownership may vary across job types (e.g., real estate with skilled job vs. no property with unskilled work). This captures joint effects of collateral and income stability.

Reasoning:
1. credit_history and employment are both strong categorical risk indicators - their combination may reveal nuanced risk patterns (e.g., critical credit with unstable employment vs good credit with stable employment)
2. credit_amount normalized by age helps contextualize loan size relative to life stage - younger applicants with large loans may represent higher risk
3. Grouping credit amounts by purpose provides baseline comparison - loans significantly larger than average for their purpose may indicate higher risk

Reasoning:
1. debt_burden_ratio directly measures how much new debt is being taken relative to current obligations, which is a strong risk indicator not captured in existing features
2. personal_employment_cross creates interaction terms between marital/gender status and employment stability - two key demographic factors that likely have non-linear combined effects on creditworthiness
3. age_existing_credits_cross captures how credit behavior changes across life stages (binned age) while accounting for current credit load (binned existing credits), addressing both lifecycle and debt capacity aspects

3. <property_credit_history_cross><cross><property_magnitude><credit_history><Combines property ownership and credit history to assess risk through asset-backed repayment behavior patterns>

Reasoning:
1. Employment duration and savings status both indicate financial stability. Their combination may reveal nuanced patterns (e.g., long employment with low savings vs short employment with high savings) that individually don't capture risk fully.

2. This ratio captures how quickly someone is managing their credit obligations relative to the new loan term. A high ratio (many existing credits relative to duration) might indicate overextension risk.

3. Property ownership often indicates financial stability, while credit history shows repayment behavior. Their interaction could reveal whether assets correlate with better repayment across different credit history categories.
