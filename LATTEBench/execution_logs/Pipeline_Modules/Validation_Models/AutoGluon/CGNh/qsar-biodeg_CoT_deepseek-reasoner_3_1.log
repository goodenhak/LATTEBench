Reasoning:
1. The nN_div_nO ratio shows extreme skew (std ~790k) - a log transform helps normalize distribution while preserving the ratio's biological significance regarding functional group balance.
2. Me and Mi are fundamental electronic descriptors; their product may capture synergistic electronic effects that influence molecular reactivity in biodegradation pathways.
3. Halogen atoms (nX) strongly impact biodegradability; grouping by halogen count and averaging oxygen content reveals structural patterns where halogen presence correlates with oxygen availability.

2025-08-26 01:50:48,441 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <abs_SdssC><abs><SdssC><Absolute value of sum of dssC E-states to capture magnitude of electronic influence, regardless of direction>
   - Reasoning: SdssC has negative values (range [-5.256, 3.12]), and taking the absolute value could better represent the strength of electronic effects for biodegradation prediction, as magnitude may matter more than sign.

2. <groupbythenmean_nN_nO><groupbythenmean><nN><nO><Mean oxygen atoms grouped by nitrogen count, revealing oxygen availability patterns relative to nitrogen content>
   - Reasoning: Nitrogen and oxygen often participate in functional groups affecting biodegradability. Grouping by nitrogen count and averaging oxygen atoms may uncover trends where nitrogen-rich compounds have systematic differences in oxygen content, potentially informative for classification.

3. <nO_div_C%><ratio><nO><C%><Ratio of oxygen atoms to carbon percentage, indicating oxygenation degree relative to carbon content>
   - Reasoning: Carbon percentage (C%) reflects molecular composition, and normalizing oxygen count by this percentage could highlight compounds with high oxygen relative to carbon backbone, potentially correlating with biodegradability due to oxidative processes.
