2. Binning age into quartiles captures nonlinear life‐stage effects (e.g., very young vs. middle‐aged vs. older applicants) without assuming a linear age impact.
3. Crossing job and purpose creates interaction categories reflecting how different occupations tend to borrow for different reasons, which may signal distinct risk profiles.
