2025-08-26 08:18:35,559 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the specified operations, aiming to improve the model's performance:

1. <CreditAgeRatio><divide><CreditScore><Age><Measures the proportion of a person's age relative to their credit score, potentially indicating credit reliability>
   - Reasoning: This feature calculates the ratio of credit score to age. A higher credit score relative to age might indicate financial responsibility and maturity, which could be predictive of credit card application success.

2. <BankMarriedCross><cross><BankCustomer><Married><Captures the interaction between bank customer status and marital status, potentially highlighting combined financial and social stability>
   - Reasoning: By capturing the intersection of bank customer status and marital status, this feature can highlight individuals who are both financially and socially stable, potentially increasing their likelihood of credit card approval.

3. <YearsEmployedNormal><zscore><YearsEmployed><Normalizes the years employed using z-score for consistent scaling>
   - Reasoning: Z-score normalization of years employed can help standardize the variability in employment duration, making it easier for the model to interpret and compare across different samples, potentially revealing patterns related to employment stability and success in credit card applications.

2025-08-26 08:28:52,922 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Based on the data and previous feature engineering attempts, here are three potential next steps for generating new features to improve predictions. These are aimed at capturing unique interactions and transformations that could add more predictive power to the model:

1. <DebtCreditInteraction><cross><Debt><CreditScore><Creates a feature capturing the interaction between existing debt levels and credit score, potentially revealing how debt management affects creditworthiness.>

   - Reasoning: By analyzing the interaction between a person's debt level and their credit score, this feature may uncover patterns in financial behavior that impact credit card application success.

2. <MarriedCitizenshipCross><cross><Married><Citizen><Generates a feature combining marital status with citizenship, potentially revealing how these socio-demographic factors interact and influence credit card application outcomes.>

   - Reasoning: The intersection of marital status and citizenship may impact financial stability and access to credit differently, making this a valuable feature for prediction tasks in credit card applications.

3. <EmploymentIncomeStability><divide><YearsEmployed><Income><Calculates the ratio of years employed to income, potentially indicating economic independence and financial growth, which might correlate with creditworthiness.>

   - Reasoning: This feature measures how employment duration relates to income levels, providing insights into an individual's economic stability and growth. Longer employment with relatively higher income could indicate a stable financial background. 

These new features aim to provide insights into the interactions and relationships between different financial and demographic characteristics, which might be influential in determining credit card application success.
