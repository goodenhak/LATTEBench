2025-08-26 03:45:13,178 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtToIncomeRatio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio of debt to income, which may indicate financial stress and affect credit card approval>
   Reasoning: Debt and Income are both numerical features. Their ratio can provide a normalized measure of debt burden relative to income, which is a strong predictor of creditworthiness. High debt-to-income ratios often lead to loan application rejections.

2. <EmployedAndBankCustomer><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between employment status and bank customer status, as both are important for credit approval>
   Reasoning: Employed and BankCustomer are binary features. Their interaction might reveal patterns where having both employment and a bank account increases approval chances more than either alone. This captures synergistic effects between financial stability indicators.

3. <CreditScoreScaled><zscore><CreditScore><Z-score normalized credit score to handle its skewed distribution and improve model performance>
   Reasoning: CreditScore has a highly skewed distribution (Q1=0, Median=0, Q3=2.75, Mean=2.4) with many zeros. Applying z-score normalization will help make this feature more normally distributed, which often improves model performance for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

2025-08-26 03:46:47,748 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtToIncomeRatio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio of debt to income, which may indicate financial stress and affect credit card approval>
   Reasoning: This creates a fundamental financial health indicator. A high debt-to-income ratio is often a red flag for lenders as it suggests the applicant may struggle to make additional payments. This feature directly addresses the creditworthiness assessment task.

2. <EmployedAndBankCustomer><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between employment status and bank customer status, as both are important for credit approval>
   Reasoning: Employment status and existing banking relationships are both strong predictors of creditworthiness. Their interaction could reveal synergistic effects - for example, being both employed and having a bank account might be much more favorable than just one of these factors alone.

3. <CreditScoreScaled><zscore><CreditScore><Z-score normalized credit score to handle its skewed distribution and improve model performance>
   Reasoning: The CreditScore feature has a highly skewed distribution (Q1=0, Median=0, Q3=2.75, Mean=2.4), with most values clustered near zero. Z-score normalization will help handle this skewness and make the feature more suitable for linear models or distance-based algorithms, potentially improving model performance.

2025-08-26 03:48:24,867 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <AgeSquared><square><Age><Squared age to capture non-linear relationships with credit card approval>
   Reasoning: Age may have a non-linear relationship with creditworthiness. Younger and older applicants might be riskier, while middle-aged applicants are more stable. Squaring age helps capture this potential quadratic relationship.

2. <EmployedToYearsEmployedRatio><ratio><Employed><YearsEmployed><Ratio of employment status to years employed, indicating stability of employment history>
   Reasoning: The combination of current employment status and years employed provides a more complete picture of job stability. This ratio could be particularly informative since employed individuals with longer tenure are likely better credit risks.

3. <IncomeLogTransformed><log><Income><Log-transformed income to handle extreme skewness and make the distribution more normal>
   Reasoning: Income has an extremely skewed distribution (mean=1135.93, but Q3=433 and max=100000). Log transformation helps normalize this distribution and makes the feature more suitable for linear models, while still preserving the relative differences in income levels.

Note: These features address different aspects of the data:
- AgeSquared: Captures non-linear age effects
- EmployedToYearsEmployedRatio: Combines employment status with experience
- IncomeLogTransformed: Handles the severe right-skew in income data

All three operations use valid numerical transformations that should improve model performance without creating division by zero issues or other mathematical problems.

2025-08-26 03:49:55,228 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <AgeGroup><bin><Age><Binned age into groups to capture non-linear effects on credit card approval>
   Reasoning: Age shows a wide range (13.75-74.83) and may have non-linear relationships with credit approval. Binning can help capture different risk profiles across age groups (e.g., young adults, middle-aged, seniors).

2. <DebtToIncomeRatio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio of debt to income, a key financial metric that lenders use to assess repayment capacity>
   Reasoning: Both Debt and Income are important financial indicators. Their ratio is a standard credit risk measure - high ratios indicate financial stress and may negatively impact approval chances. This was rejected previously but might work better with proper handling of zero/negative income.

3. <EmploymentStability><groupbythenmean><Employed><YearsEmployed><Average years employed for employment status groups, indicating stability patterns>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has high variability (0-28.5 years). Grouping by employment status and calculating mean years employed can reveal stability patterns - employed individuals with longer tenure might be more creditworthy.

   Reasoning: Age and Debt are both numerical features that may have an interactive effect on credit card approval. Older applicants with high debt might be viewed differently than younger applicants with the same debt level. A cross feature can capture this non-linear relationship that a linear model might miss.

2. <IncomeToCreditScoreRatio><ratio><Income><CreditScore><Ratio of income to credit score, indicating the income backing per unit of creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Both Income and CreditScore are important financial indicators. This ratio creates a new metric that shows how much income supports the reported credit score. A high ratio might indicate strong repayment capacity relative to credit history, which could be favorable for approval.

3. <EmploymentStatusStability><groupbythenmean><Employed><YearsEmployed><Average years employed by employment status group, revealing stability patterns among employed vs unemployed applicants>
   Reasoning: This feature groups by employment status and calculates the average years employed within each group. It can reveal that employed applicants tend to have more stable employment histories (longer average tenure) compared to unemployed applicants, which could be an important predictor of creditworthiness beyond just the binary employment status.

2025-08-26 03:55:12,723 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeSqrtTransformed><sqrt><Income><Square root transformation of income to reduce skewness and handle extreme values, making the distribution more normal for modeling>
   Reasoning: The Income feature has a very high standard deviation (5956.47) compared to its median (5.0), indicating extreme right skewness. Square root transformation is effective for reducing the impact of extreme values while preserving the original data structure better than log transformation (which might fail for zero values).

2. <EmploymentDurationStability><groupbythenstd><Employed><YearsEmployed><Standard deviation of years employed by employment status group, measuring consistency of employment history which is important for credit assessment>
   Reasoning: The relationship between employment status and years employed could reveal important patterns. Employed individuals with stable long-term employment (low std) might be more creditworthy than those with volatile employment history (high std), even if currently employed.

3. <AgeDebtIncomeInteraction><cross><Age><Debt><Income><Three-way interaction between age, debt and income, capturing complex relationships where older individuals with high debt but sufficient income might have different approval patterns than younger applicants with similar profiles>
   Reasoning: Age, debt, and income are three critical financial indicators that likely interact in complex ways. Older applicants with higher debt might be more approved if they have high income, while younger applicants with the same profile might be viewed as overleveraged.

   Reasoning: Income is extremely right-skewed (mean=1135.93, Q3=433, max=100000). Log transformation is a standard technique to handle such skewness, but since there are zeros (Q1=0, median=5), we use log(1+x) to avoid undefined values. This can help linear models better capture the relationship with the target.

2. <DebtToIncomeRatio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio of debt to income, a key financial metric that indicates debt burden and repayment capacity which is crucial for credit approval decisions>
   Reasoning: Lenders commonly use debt-to-income ratio to assess creditworthiness. This feature combines two important financial indicators (debt and income) into a single meaningful metric that could have a strong predictive power for credit card approval.

3. <EmploymentStability><groupbythenstd><Employed><YearsEmployed><Standard deviation of years employed within employment status groups, measuring consistency of work history which is important for credit assessment>
   Reasoning: Employment stability is a key factor in credit decisions. By calculating the standard deviation of years employed for employed vs unemployed groups, we can create a feature that captures the variability in employment history, which might be predictive of credit risk.

   Reasoning: Creating an interaction between Income and Debt can capture how their combined effect influences credit card approval. High debt might be less concerning with high income, but problematic with low income.

2. <EmployedPriorDefaultInteraction><cross><Employed><PriorDefault><Interaction between employment status and prior default history, as employed individuals with no defaults might be much more likely approved than unemployed with defaults>
   Reasoning: Employment status and default history are both critical factors. Their interaction may reveal synergistic effects that are stronger than either feature alone for predicting approval.

3. <YearsEmployedStability><groupbythenstd><Employed><YearsEmployed><Standard deviation of years employed within employment status groups, measuring consistency of work history which is highly relevant for credit assessment>
   Reasoning: This feature was previously rejected but with a different operator (groupbythenmean). Using groupbythenstd instead might better capture employment stability patterns, which lenders value.

   Reasoning: The interaction between income and debt is likely important for credit decisions, but the effect might not be linear. Squaring this interaction could capture more complex relationships where extremely high or low values have disproportionate effects on approval probability.

2. <EmploymentStabilityIndex><groupbythenmean><Employed><YearsEmployed><Average years employed by employment status group, creating an index that measures typical employment duration stability which is crucial for creditworthiness assessment>
   Reasoning: Rather than using standard deviation (which was rejected), using the mean years employed by employment status group provides a different perspective on employment stability. Employed individuals with longer average tenure might be viewed more favorably than those with sporadic employment history.

3. <CreditScoreIncomeRatioLog><log><CreditScoreIncomeRatio><Log transformation of the ratio between credit score and income to handle skewness and create a more normally distributed feature that represents creditworthiness relative to income>
   Reasoning: The ratio of credit score to income could be highly skewed, and log transformation helps normalize the distribution. This feature captures how much creditworthiness (score) someone has relative to their income level, which is a key consideration for lenders.

2025-08-26 04:06:32,216 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeDebtRatio><ratio><Income><Debt><Ratio of income to debt, which provides a direct measure of financial capacity to handle additional credit obligations and is a key metric in credit decisions>
   Reasoning: While debt-to-income ratio is common, income-to-debt ratio might be more intuitive and could better capture financial capacity. This ratio directly measures how much income is available per unit of debt, which is crucial for assessing repayment ability.

2. <EmployedBankCustomerInteraction><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between employment status and bank customer status, as having both employment and an existing banking relationship significantly increases creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: The combination of being employed AND having a bank account likely indicates much stronger financial stability than either feature alone. This interaction could capture a particularly creditworthy segment that might be missed when considering these features separately.

3. <YearsEmployedStabilityIndex><groupbythenstd><Employed><YearsEmployed><Standard deviation of years employed within employment status groups, measuring consistency of work history which is highly relevant for credit assessment as stable employment indicates reliable income>
   Reasoning: Previous groupby operations using mean were rejected, but standard deviation might provide different insights. This measures employment stability - applicants with low standard deviation within their employment group have more consistent work history, which lenders value highly for credit decisions.
