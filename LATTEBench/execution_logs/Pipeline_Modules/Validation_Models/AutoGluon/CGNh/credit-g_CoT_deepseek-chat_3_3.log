2025-08-25 11:59:25,020 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_duration_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Ratio of credit amount to loan duration, indicating the monthly burden if repaid linearly.>
   Reasoning: This feature combines the credit amount and duration to create a measure of the monthly repayment amount, which is directly related to the borrower's ability to repay. A higher ratio indicates a heavier monthly burden, potentially increasing default risk.

2. <checking_status_credit_history_cross><cross><checking_status><credit_history><Interaction between checking account status and credit history, capturing combined financial stability.>
   Reasoning: The combination of checking account status (liquidity) and credit history (past repayment behavior) provides a more comprehensive view of financial health than either feature alone. This interaction can reveal patterns like no checking with critical history being extremely high risk.

3. <age_binned><bin><age><5><Age grouped into 5-year bins to capture non-linear effects on creditworthiness.>
   Reasoning: Age often has a non-linear relationship with credit risk (e.g., very young and very old applicants might be riskier). Binning helps the model capture these patterns without assuming linearity, and 5-year bins provide a good balance between granularity and generalization.

   Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between the loan amount and the borrower's existing financial obligations. A high ratio might indicate a riskier loan that consumes a larger portion of disposable income, potentially affecting repayment ability.

2. <savings_status_employment_cross><cross><savings_status><employment><Interaction between savings status and employment stability, capturing combined financial security.>
   Reasoning: Employment stability and savings are both strong indicators of financial health. Their interaction could reveal nuanced patterns (e.g., unemployed with high savings vs. employed with no savings) that individually might not capture risk as effectively.

3. <duration_binned><bin><duration><5><Loan duration grouped into bins to capture non-linear relationships with default risk.>
   Reasoning: While duration is numerical, its relationship with credit risk might not be linear. Very short-term loans (e.g., <12 months) might be for emergencies, while very long-term loans (e.g., >48 months) might carry higher risk due to economic uncertainty over time. Binning helps model these non-linear effects.

   Reasoning: This ratio captures the relative burden of the loan compared to the borrower's disposable income commitment, which is a strong indicator of repayment capacity. Lower ratios suggest better ability to repay.

2. <savings_status_property_cross><cross><savings_status><property_magnitude><Interaction between savings status and property ownership, capturing combined asset strength.>

3. <duration_age_ratio><ratio><duration><age><Ratio of loan duration to borrower age, capturing life stage appropriateness of loan term.>
   Reasoning: This ratio helps assess whether the loan duration is appropriate for the borrower's life stage. Very long loans for older borrowers or very short loans for younger borrowers might indicate higher risk.

2025-08-25 12:04:24,635 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to handle skewness and reduce the impact of extreme values.>
   - Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a high standard deviation relative to its mean (Std=2769.8, Mean=3170.7), indicating right-skewness. Applying a log transformation can normalize the distribution, making it easier for linear models to learn and reducing the influence of outliers.

2. <employment_residence_since_cross><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment stability and residence stability, capturing combined lifestyle stability.>
   - Reasoning: Both employment (years at current job) and residence_since (years at current residence) are indicators of stability. Cross-tabulating these categorical features may reveal combined patterns that affect creditworthiness, such as individuals with both long employment and residence being lower risk.

3. <age_squared><square><age><Squared age term to capture potential non-linear relationships with credit risk, such as middle-aged applicants being most creditworthy.>
   - Reasoning: Age often has a U-shaped relationship with credit risk (very young and very old may be higher risk). Squaring age allows a quadratic term to be included in linear models, enabling them to fit this non-linearity without requiring binning.

2025-08-25 12:07:12,297 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the current feature set and the task of credit approval prediction, I can identify several opportunities to create more informative features:

1. Credit burden relative to age: While we have credit_amount_duration_ratio, we should also consider the credit amount relative to the borrower's age, as older individuals might handle larger debts differently.

2. Employment stability interaction: Combining employment duration with residence stability could indicate overall life stability, which is important for creditworthiness.

3. Income-adjusted credit metrics: We need to normalize credit-related metrics by income commitment to better assess affordability.

Here are 3 potential feature engineering steps:

1. <credit_amount_age_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><age><Ratio of credit amount to borrower age, indicating debt burden relative to life stage and earning potential.>
   - Reasoning: This captures whether the loan size is appropriate for the borrower's life stage. Younger borrowers with large loans relative to age might be riskier.

2. <employment_residence_stability><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment duration and residence stability, capturing overall lifestyle and financial stability.>
   - Reasoning: Long-term employment combined with stable residence indicates reliability and lower risk of default.

3. <monthly_payment_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount_duration_ratio><installment_commitment><Ratio of estimated monthly payment to income commitment, measuring actual payment burden affordability.>
   - Reasoning: This directly measures what percentage of disposable income would be consumed by the loan payment, a key affordability metric.

2025-08-25 12:10:00,427 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_sqrt><sqrt><credit_amount><Square root of credit amount to reduce skewness and handle extreme values, making the distribution more normal for linear models.>
   Reasoning: The credit_amount feature has a high standard deviation relative to its mean (2769.8 vs 3170.7), indicating significant right skew. Applying a square root transformation can help normalize the distribution and reduce the influence of extremely large loan amounts, which may improve model performance.

2. <employment_duration_cross><cross><employment><duration><Interaction between employment stability and loan duration, capturing whether stable employment supports longer repayment periods.>
   Reasoning: Employment stability (employment) and loan duration (duration) are both important factors for credit risk assessment. Their interaction could reveal patterns like: those with unstable employment (<1 year) taking long-duration loans might be higher risk, while those with stable employment (≥7 years) with medium-duration loans might be lower risk.

3. <existing_credits_ratio><ratio><existing_credits><num_dependents><Ratio of existing credits to number of dependents, measuring credit obligations relative to financial responsibilities.>
   Reasoning: Both existing_credits and num_dependents represent financial burdens. Someone with many dependents but few existing credits might be different from someone with few dependents but many credits. This ratio could capture the balance between credit obligations and family financial responsibilities.

2025-08-25 12:13:02,361 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <existing_credits_duration_ratio><ratio><existing_credits><duration><Ratio of existing credits to loan duration, measuring credit density over time which may indicate repayment capacity.>
   Reasoning: This feature combines the number of existing credits with the loan duration to create a measure of credit density. A higher ratio might indicate a borrower is taking on multiple credits in a short period, which could signal financial stress and higher default risk.

2. <credit_history_employment_cross><cross><credit_history><employment><Interaction between credit history and employment stability, capturing combined reliability in financial commitments and income stability.>
   Reasoning: Both credit history and employment status are strong individual predictors. Their interaction could reveal nuanced patterns - for example, someone with excellent credit history but unstable employment might have different risk than someone with stable employment but poor credit history.

3. <credit_amount_zscore><zscore><credit_amount><Z-score normalized credit amount to identify outliers and standardize the scale for better model performance.>
   Reasoning: While we already have credit_amount_sqrt to handle skewness, z-score normalization can further help models sensitive to feature scales (like linear models) by identifying extreme values that might be influential points or potential fraud indicators.

These features were chosen because:
1. They combine different aspects of the data (credit obligations, financial history, and loan characteristics)
2. They address both numerical scaling issues and categorical interactions
3. They capture potential non-linear relationships and outlier effects
4. They're likely to provide additional predictive power beyond the existing features

2025-08-25 12:15:52,894 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to further reduce skewness and handle extreme values, complementing the square root transformation for better linear model performance.>
   Reasoning: While credit_amount_sqrt helps with skewness, applying a log transformation can provide an even stronger normalization effect for highly skewed financial amounts, making the distribution more symmetric and improving model performance with linear assumptions.

2. <employment_residence_stability><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment duration and residence stability, capturing overall lifestyle and financial stability which are both important indicators of creditworthiness.>
   Reasoning: Both employment stability (years employed) and residence stability (years at current address) are strong individual predictors of financial responsibility. Their interaction may reveal synergistic effects where stable employment combined with stable residence indicates particularly low risk.

3. <monthly_payment_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount_duration_ratio><installment_commitment><Ratio of estimated monthly payment (from duration ratio) to income commitment, measuring actual payment burden affordability relative to disposable income.>
   Reasoning: This builds on the existing credit_amount_duration_ratio (which estimates monthly payment) by comparing it to the installment commitment (percentage of disposable income), creating a direct measure of payment burden affordability that should be highly predictive of default risk.

2025-08-25 12:18:43,163 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to further reduce skewness and handle extreme values, complementing the square root transformation for better linear model performance.>
   Reasoning: While credit_amount_sqrt helps with skewness, log transformation can be even more effective for highly skewed financial data like credit amounts. This creates a more normal distribution that works better with linear models and distance-based algorithms, while also reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. <employment_residence_stability><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment duration and residence stability, capturing overall lifestyle and financial stability which are both important indicators of creditworthiness.>
   Reasoning: Both employment stability (years employed) and residence stability (years at current address) are strong individual predictors of creditworthiness. Their interaction may reveal even stronger patterns - for example, someone with both long employment AND long residence at the same address represents a highly stable applicant likely to receive credit.

3. <monthly_payment_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount_duration_ratio><installment_commitment><Ratio of estimated monthly payment (from duration ratio) to income commitment, measuring actual payment burden affordability relative to disposable income.>
   Reasoning: This combines two powerful existing features - the monthly burden estimate (credit_amount_duration_ratio) and the income commitment percentage. This directly measures whether the estimated monthly payment is affordable given the applicant's disposable income, which is a crucial factor in credit approval decisions.

2025-08-25 12:21:33,240 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm of credit amount to further reduce skewness and handle extreme values, complementing the square root transformation for better linear model performance.>
   - Reasoning: While we already have credit_amount_sqrt, a log transformation can provide an even stronger normalization effect for highly skewed financial data like credit amounts. This can help linear models better capture relationships without being dominated by extreme values.

2. <employment_residence_stability><cross><employment><residence_since><Interaction between employment duration and residence stability, capturing overall lifestyle and financial stability which are both important indicators of creditworthiness.>
   - Reasoning: Both employment stability (years at current job) and residence stability (years at current address) are strong individual predictors of creditworthiness. Their interaction may reveal synergistic effects - someone with stability in both areas is likely more reliable than someone stable in only one area.

3. <monthly_payment_income_ratio><ratio><credit_amount_duration_ratio><installment_commitment><Ratio of estimated monthly payment (from duration ratio) to income commitment, measuring actual payment burden affordability relative to disposable income.>
   - Reasoning: This combines our existing credit_amount_duration_ratio (monthly payment estimate) with installment_commitment (percentage of disposable income). This directly measures whether the estimated monthly payment is affordable given the borrower's income commitment, which is a crucial factor in credit approval decisions.
