   Reasoning: Both oxygen and nitrogen atoms can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might influence biodegradation. Summing them could capture the total potential for hydrogen bond donation/acceptance.

2. <C_percent_times_nCp><multiply><C%><nCp><Interaction between carbon percentage and number of terminal primary carbons, possibly indicating chain length and biodegradability>
   Reasoning: The percentage of carbon atoms combined with the number of terminal primary carbons might indicate molecular size and branching, which are factors in biodegradation.

3. <SdO_zscore><zscore><SdO><Standardized sum of dO E-states to normalize its distribution for better model performance>
   Reasoning: SdO has a wide range (0 to 71.167) and high standard deviation (12.2463). Standardizing it could help models that assume normalized features.

2025-08-25 20:27:11,270 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN_sqrt><sqrt><nO_plus_nN><Square root of oxygen and nitrogen atom sum to reduce skewness and handle non-linear relationships>
   Reasoning: The sum of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (nO_plus_nN) has a range of [0,15] with mean 2.54 and std 2.18, indicating right skewness. Applying square root transformation can normalize the distribution and potentially reveal non-linear patterns that linear models might miss, while preserving the hydrogen bonding correlation with biodegradability.

2. <C_percent_times_nCp_log><log><C_percent_times_nCp><Log transform of carbon percentage times terminal carbons to handle extreme values and multiplicative effects>
   Reasoning: The interaction feature C_percent_times_nCp has an extremely wide range [0,907.2] with high standard deviation (77.95), suggesting the presence of outliers and exponential relationships. Logarithmic transformation can compress the scale, reduce the influence of extreme values, and potentially linearize relationships with the target variable.

3. <nHDon_plus_nO_plus_nN><plus><nHDon><nO_plus_nN><Combined count of hydrogen bond donors and oxygen/nitrogen atoms for enhanced hydrogen bonding potential indicator>
   Reasoning: nHDon specifically counts hydrogen bond donors (N and O atoms), while nO_plus_nN counts all oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Combining these features creates a more comprehensive measure of hydrogen bonding capacity, which is strongly correlated with biodegradability as hydrogen bonding affects molecular interactions with biological systems.

2025-08-25 20:32:32,197 - INFO - LLM Output: Looking at the dataset and the accepted/rejected features, I can see that interactions between oxygen/nitrogen features and carbon-related features are proving valuable. The accepted features show that combining oxygen/nitrogen counts and carbon percentage with terminal carbons is beneficial for biodegradability prediction. Here are 3 potential next steps:

1. <nO_ratio_C_percent><divide><nO><C%><Ratio of oxygen atoms to carbon percentage, indicating oxygenation level relative to carbon content which may affect biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of oxygen to carbon content could be a strong indicator of biodegradability, as more oxygenated compounds are often more biodegradable. This captures the balance between oxidation state and carbon backbone.

2. <nHDon_times_nO><multiply><nHDon><nO><Interaction between hydrogen bond donors and oxygen atoms, potentially indicating hydrogen bonding capacity and solubility effects>
   - Reasoning: Hydrogen bond donors and oxygen atoms both contribute to hydrogen bonding potential. Their multiplicative interaction might better capture the compound's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which correlates with water solubility and biodegradability.

3. <LOC_sqrt><sqrt><LOC><Square root of Lopping centric index to reduce right-skewness and capture non-linear relationships with molecular branching>
   - Reasoning: The Lopping centric index (LOC) has a range [0.0, 4.491] with mean 1.3693, indicating some right-skewness. Square root transformation can normalize the distribution and help linear models capture its relationship with biodegradability more effectively.

2025-08-25 20:36:15,842 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_ratio_nN><divide><nN><C%><Ratio of nitrogen atoms to carbon percentage, indicating nitrogen content relative to carbon which may affect biodegradation pathways>
   - Reasoning: Nitrogen content relative to carbon could be important for biodegradability as nitrogen-containing compounds often have different degradation pathways. This ratio might capture the nitrogen enrichment effect better than absolute counts.

2. <nHM_times_nX><multiply><nHM><nX><Interaction between heavy atoms and halogen atoms, potentially indicating molecular complexity and halogen substitution effects on biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Heavy atoms represent molecular size/complexity, while halogens often decrease biodegradability. Their interaction might capture synergistic effects where larger halogenated molecules are particularly resistant to degradation.

3. <SdO_ratio_nO><divide><SdO><nO><Average dO E-state per oxygen atom, indicating the electronic environment and reactivity of oxygen atoms which may influence biodegradation>
   - Reasoning: This normalizes the SdO (sum of dO E-states) by the number of oxygen atoms, giving the average electronic state per oxygen. This could better capture oxygen reactivity than the total sum, especially for molecules with varying oxygen counts.

Reasoning:
1. The nO_plus_nN feature shows a range of [0,15] with mean 2.54 and std 2.18, indicating right-skewness. Applying a square root transformation will normalize the distribution and capture non-linear relationships with the target variable, potentially improving model performance for gradient-based algorithms.

2. C_percent_times_nCp has extreme values (range [0,907.2]) with high standard deviation (77.95), suggesting multiplicative effects. A log transform will compress the scale, handle outliers, and make the relationship with biodegradability more linear while preserving the interaction effect between carbon percentage and terminal carbons.

3. Creating a ratio between hydrogen bond donors and oxygen atoms could reveal important structural patterns. Since both features relate to molecular polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity, their ratio might indicate specific molecular configurations that influence biodegradability more effectively than either feature alone.

2025-08-25 20:43:46,959 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN_ratio_C_percent><divide><nO_plus_nN><C%><Ratio of oxygen and nitrogen atom sum to carbon percentage, indicating overall heteroatom content relative to carbon backbone which may influence biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: Combines the beneficial nO_plus_nN feature with carbon percentage to create a normalized measure of heteroatom density. This could better capture the balance between biodegradation-enhancing elements (O, N) and the carbon backbone that needs to be broken down.

2. <nHDon_plus_nO><plus><nHDon><nO><Sum of hydrogen bond donors and oxygen atoms, capturing both hydrogen bonding capacity and oxygen content in a single feature>
   - Reasoning: Creates a composite feature that combines hydrogen bond donors (which facilitate microbial attachment) with oxygen atoms (which indicate oxygenation and potential degradation sites). This may better represent the molecular properties that favor biodegradation than either feature alone.

3. <C_percent_times_nCp_sqrt><sqrt><C_percent_times_nCp><Square root of carbon percentage times terminal carbons to reduce extreme values while preserving the interaction effect on chain length and biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: The log transform (C_percent_times_nCp_log) was accepted but has extreme negative values. A square root transform provides a similar variance-stabilizing effect but with a more gradual transformation that might work better for the many zero values in this feature.

Reasoning:
1. nO_plus_nN_ratio_C_percent: This creates a normalized measure of heteroatom content relative to carbon backbone. Biodegradability often correlates with the presence of oxygen/nitrogen atoms relative to carbon content, as higher ratios may indicate more biodegradable functional groups. This could capture patterns that individual oxygen/nitrogen counts or carbon percentage alone might miss.

2. nHDon_plus_nO: Combines hydrogen bond donors and oxygen atoms into a single feature that captures both hydrogen bonding capacity and oxygen content. This could be more predictive than the interaction term (nHDon_times_nO) since it's additive rather than multiplicative, potentially capturing linear relationships better with certain models.

3. C_percent_times_nCp_sqrt: Applies square root transformation to the interaction term to reduce the impact of extreme values while preserving the relationship between carbon percentage and terminal carbons. This might work better than the log transform for values near zero, avoiding the negative infinity issue seen in the log transform.

2025-08-25 20:53:44,997 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_plus_nN_ratio_C_percent><divide><nO_plus_nN><C%><Ratio of oxygen and nitrogen atom sum to carbon percentage, indicating overall heteroatom content relative to carbon backbone which may influence biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the total heteroatom count (O+N) with carbon percentage, creating a measure of heteroatom density relative to the carbon backbone. Higher values indicate more oxygen/nitrogen atoms per carbon unit, which could enhance biodegradability through increased polarity and potential metabolic pathways.

2. <nHDon_plus_nO><plus><nHDon><nO><Sum of hydrogen bond donors and oxygen atoms, capturing both hydrogen bonding capacity and oxygen content in a single feature>
   - Reasoning: This simple sum aggregates two key properties related to solubility and hydrogen bonding. Both nHDon and nO individually contribute to biodegradability, and their combined effect might capture synergistic interactions that improve model performance.

3. <C_percent_times_nCp_sqrt><sqrt><C_percent_times_nCp><Square root of carbon percentage times terminal carbons to reduce extreme values while preserving the interaction effect on chain length and biodegradability>
   - Reasoning: The existing C_percent_times_nCp feature has extreme values (range [0, 907.2]) that might distort linear models. Applying a square root transformation reduces skewness while maintaining the multiplicative relationship between carbon percentage and terminal carbons, which indicates chain length effects.
