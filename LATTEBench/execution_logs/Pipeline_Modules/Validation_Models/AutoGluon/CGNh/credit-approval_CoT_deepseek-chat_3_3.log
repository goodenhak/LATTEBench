2025-08-26 07:30:25,223 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <YearsEmployedGroup><bin><YearsEmployed><Binned years employed to capture non-linear relationships with credit approval>
   Reasoning: YearsEmployed has a highly skewed distribution (median=1.0, mean=2.23, Q3=2.625) with many zeros. Binning will help capture non-linear patterns where short vs long employment histories may have different impacts on approval.

2. <CreditScoreToIncomeRatio><divide><CreditScore><Income><Ratio of credit score to income, which may indicate creditworthiness relative to earning capacity>
   Reasoning: Both CreditScore and Income are important financial indicators. Their ratio could reveal patterns where high credit scores with low income (or vice versa) have different approval outcomes than expected from either feature alone.

3. <PriorDefaultAndEmployed><cross><PriorDefault><Employed><Interaction between prior default status and current employment, as both factors significantly impact creditworthiness>
   Reasoning: Prior default and current employment status are both strong predictors. Their interaction could reveal that employed individuals with prior defaults have different approval rates than unemployed individuals with clean records.

2025-08-26 07:32:07,192 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <DebtToIncomeRatioZScore><zscore><DebtToIncomeRatio><Standardized DebtToIncomeRatio to handle outliers and improve model convergence>
   Reasoning: DebtToIncomeRatio has an extremely high range and standard deviation, indicating severe outliers. Applying z-score normalization can help mitigate the impact of these outliers, making the feature more normally distributed and improving the performance of linear models or distance-based algorithms.

2. <IncomeLog><log><Income><Log-transformed Income to handle skewness and reduce the effect of extreme values>
   Reasoning: Income has a very high range (0 to 100000) and a mean (1217) much lower than its maximum, indicating a right-skewed distribution with outliers. Log transformation can compress the scale, making the distribution more symmetric and reducing the influence of extreme high incomes, which should help the model better capture the relationship between income and credit approval.

3. <IndustryTargetEnc><target_encoding><Industry><Target encoding for Industry to capture the relationship between job sector and credit approval success>
   Reasoning: Industry is a high-cardinality categorical feature (14 categories). Target encoding can transform it into a numerical value representing the mean approval rate for each industry, which may be more informative than one-hot encoding for tree-based models and can help reduce dimensionality while preserving predictive power.

2025-08-26 07:33:16,039 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <AgeSquared><square><Age><Squared age to capture potential non-linear effects on credit approval>
   Reasoning: Age may have a quadratic relationship with creditworthiness, where both very young and very old applicants might be perceived differently. Squaring age can help capture this potential non-linearity that might not be fully captured by the existing AgeGroup bins.

2. <EmployedToYearsEmployedRatio><divide><YearsEmployed><Employed><Ratio of years employed to employment status, indicating stability for employed individuals>
   Reasoning: For employed individuals, the ratio of years employed to employment status (which is 1 when employed) represents their tenure. This could be a stronger indicator of job stability than years employed alone, especially when combined with current employment status.

3. <CreditScoreDebtInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><Debt><Interaction between credit score and debt to capture how debt burden affects creditworthiness assessment>
   Reasoning: The relationship between credit score and debt burden might be important - a high credit score with high debt might be different from a high score with low debt. This multiplicative interaction can help capture this joint effect on approval likelihood.

2025-08-26 07:35:31,150 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeSquared><square><Income><Squared income to capture non-linear effects and amplify income differences for credit assessment>
   Reasoning: Income is a crucial factor in credit approval, and squaring it can help capture non-linear relationships where higher incomes might have disproportionately positive effects on approval chances.

2. <EmployedToIncomeRatio><divide><YearsEmployed><Income><Ratio of employment duration to income, indicating career progression and earning stability>
   Reasoning: This combines employment duration with income level to create a feature that represents career trajectory, which could be a strong indicator of financial stability and creditworthiness.

3. <CreditScoreAgeInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><AgeSquared><Interaction between credit score and squared age to capture how creditworthiness assessment varies across different life stages>
   Reasoning: Credit score importance might vary with age (e.g., younger applicants with good scores vs older applicants), and this interaction captures potential non-linear age effects on credit evaluation.

2025-08-26 07:38:12,893 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeStability><divide><Income><YearsEmployed><Ratio of income to years employed, indicating earning consistency and career progression>
   Reasoning: This feature could capture how efficiently someone converts their work experience into income, which might indicate career success and financial stability - both important factors for creditworthiness.

2. <CreditScoreToDebtRatio><divide><CreditScore><Debt><Ratio of credit score to debt, measuring creditworthiness relative to debt burden>
   Reasoning: This interaction could reveal how much creditworthiness someone maintains despite their debt level. A high ratio suggests good credit management skills, while a low ratio might indicate over-leveraging.

3. <EmploymentStability><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Composite measure of employment stability combining current employment status with duration>
   Reasoning: This feature weights employment duration by current employment status, giving higher values to those who are both currently employed and have longer tenure, which strongly signals stability to lenders.

These features focus on creating meaningful ratios and interactions that capture financial stability patterns and credit management behaviors that are directly relevant to credit card approval decisions.

2025-08-26 07:39:50,191 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <CreditScoreIncomeInteraction><multiply><CreditScore><Income><Interaction between credit score and income to capture combined effect on creditworthiness assessment>
   Reasoning: CreditScore and Income are both important indicators of financial health. Their multiplicative interaction may reveal synergistic effects where high income amplifies the positive impact of good credit (or vice versa), which could be predictive of approval success.

2. <EmployedBankCustomerInteraction><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between employment status and bank customer status to capture combined effect on financial stability>
   Reasoning: Both employment and existing banking relationships are strong positive signals for creditworthiness. Their cross feature (creating categories like employed_with_account, employed_no_account, etc.) may reveal subgroups with distinct approval patterns that aren't captured by the individual features alone.

3. <DebtToIncomeRatioLog><log><DebtToIncomeRatio><Log-transformed DebtToIncomeRatio to handle extreme skewness and make the distribution more normal>
   Reasoning: DebtToIncomeRatio has extreme outliers (range up to 19,000,000) with a highly skewed distribution (mean >> median). Log transformation can compress the scale while preserving ordinal relationships, making it more suitable for linear models and improving convergence.

2025-08-26 07:42:39,094 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeStabilityIndex><divide><Income><YearsEmployed><Ratio of income to years employed, indicating earning consistency and career progression, which may signal financial stability to lenders>
   Reasoning: This creates a measure of how much income someone earns per year of employment. Higher values could indicate strong career progression or high-value skills, both positive signals for creditworthiness. This differs from rejected features by focusing specifically on income stability rather than employment duration alone.

2. <CreditScoreScaledByIncome><multiply><CreditScore><Income><Product of credit score and income to capture their combined effect on creditworthiness, where both high scores and high income are favorable>
   Reasoning: This interaction feature multiplies two strong positive indicators of creditworthiness. Unlike the rejected CreditScoreIncomeInteraction (which had a negative score), this approach scales the credit score by income magnitude, creating a feature that rewards applicants with both good credit and high earnings.

3. <EmploymentBankStatus><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between employment status and banking relationship, as employed individuals with existing bank accounts may represent lower risk>
   Reasoning: This creates categorical combinations of employment and banking status. Both features individually show strong patterns (Employed mean=0.44, BankCustomer mean=0.76), and their interaction may reveal subgroups with particularly high or low approval rates that aren't captured by the individual features alone.

These features address different aspects of creditworthiness: income stability, the combined effect of credit score and income, and the interaction between employment and banking relationships - all relevant factors for credit card approval decisions.

2025-08-26 07:43:56,298 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeStability><divide><Income><YearsEmployed><Ratio of income to years employed, indicating earning consistency and career progression, which may signal financial stability to lenders>
   Reasoning: This feature captures how much income a person earns per year of employment. A higher ratio suggests strong earning power relative to experience, which could indicate financial stability and better creditworthiness. This addresses the skewness in both Income and YearsEmployed by creating a more meaningful composite metric.

2. <CreditScoreToDebtRatio><divide><CreditScore><Debt><Ratio of credit score to debt, measuring creditworthiness relative to debt burden>
   Reasoning: This ratio balances a person's creditworthiness (CreditScore) against their existing debt burden. A high ratio indicates good credit relative to debt, which should be favorable for credit card approval. This creates a more nuanced feature than using CreditScore or Debt alone.

3. <EmploymentBankInteraction><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between employment status and bank customer status, as both employed individuals and existing bank customers typically represent lower risk profiles>
   Reasoning: Employment status and banking relationship are both strong indicators of financial stability. Their interaction may reveal synergistic effects - employed bank customers likely represent the lowest risk, while unemployed non-customers represent the highest risk. This categorical interaction can capture non-linear relationships that individual features might miss.

   Reasoning: This feature captures whether an applicant's income is stable relative to their employment duration. A high ratio suggests strong earning power and career progression, which are positive indicators for creditworthiness. This addresses the high variance in Income and YearsEmployed by creating a more stable metric.

2. <CreditScoreToDebtRatio><divide><CreditScore><Debt><Ratio of credit score to debt, measuring creditworthiness relative to debt burden>
   Reasoning: This combines two critical factors - credit score and debt - into a single metric that indicates how much creditworthiness an applicant has relative to their debt load. A higher ratio suggests better ability to manage additional credit, which should be predictive of approval success.

3. <EmploymentBankInteraction><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between employment status and bank customer status, as both employed individuals and existing bank customers typically represent lower risk profiles>
   Reasoning: Both employment and existing banking relationships are strong indicators of financial stability. This interaction feature captures the combined effect - employed bank customers likely represent the lowest risk, while unemployed non-customers represent the highest risk, with mixed cases in between.
