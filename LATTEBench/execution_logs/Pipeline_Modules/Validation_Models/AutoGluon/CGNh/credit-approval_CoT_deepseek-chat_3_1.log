   Reasoning: This feature combines credit score and income, two important factors in credit decisions. A higher ratio suggests better creditworthiness relative to income, which could be predictive of approval success.

2. <EmployedPriorDefaultCross><cross><Employed><PriorDefault><Interaction between employment status and prior default history to capture combined effect on approval>
   Reasoning: The combination of employment status and prior default history likely has a strong interactive effect on credit card approval. Employed individuals with no prior defaults should have much higher approval rates than other combinations.

3. <YearsEmployedGroupMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><YearsEmployed><Mean years employed by industry, indicating industry stability which may affect credit approval>
   Reasoning: Different industries have different employment stability patterns. This feature captures the typical employment duration in each industry, which could be indicative of income stability and thus creditworthiness.

2025-08-26 03:20:37,995 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <AgeSquared><square><Age><Squared age to capture non-linear effects on creditworthiness beyond simple binning>
   Reasoning: While AgeGroup captures binned age categories, squaring age creates a continuous non-linear feature that may better capture the relationship between age and credit approval probability, particularly since creditworthiness often increases with age but may plateau or decline in later years.

2. <IncomeToDebtRatio><ratio><Income><Debt><Ratio of Income to Debt, providing an alternative perspective on financial health compared to DebtToIncomeRatio>
   Reasoning: The existing DebtToIncomeRatio has extreme outliers (range up to 26M) which might cause modeling issues. IncomeToDebtRatio would have a more reasonable range while still capturing the relationship between income and debt obligations, which is crucial for credit assessment.

3. <IndustryStabilityScore><groupbythenstd><Industry><YearsEmployed><Standard deviation of years employed by industry, measuring employment stability within industries which affects credit risk>
   Reasoning: While YearsEmployedGroupMean captures average employment duration by industry, the standard deviation would measure employment stability within each industry. Industries with low standard deviation (stable employment) might indicate lower credit risk, while high variability might indicate seasonal or unstable work patterns.

   Reasoning: The Income feature has a very high standard deviation (3391.39) compared to its median (5.0), indicating extreme right skewness. Applying a log transformation can help normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of outliers on the prediction.

2. <AgeDebtInteraction><multiply><Age><Debt><Interaction between Age and Debt to capture how debt burden affects different age groups differently in credit approval>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants might handle debt differently than older applicants. This interaction term can help the model learn these age-specific debt effects that wouldn't be captured by considering age and debt separately.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, indicating industry-specific creditworthiness patterns that may affect approval decisions>
   Reasoning: Different industries may have systematically different credit profiles. Calculating the average credit score by industry can reveal these patterns and provide contextual information about an applicant's credit score relative to their industry peers.

2025-08-26 03:26:02,917 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeLog><log><Income><Logarithm of Income to handle extreme skewness and create a more normal distribution for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The Income feature has an extremely high standard deviation (3391) compared to its median (5), indicating severe right-skewness with many outliers. Log transformation is a standard technique to handle such skewed financial data, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme values.

2. <AgeDebtInteraction><multiply><Age><Debt><Interaction between Age and Debt to capture how debt burden affects different age groups differently in credit approval decisions>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants may struggle more with debt repayment than older, more established applicants. This interaction term can help the model learn age-dependent effects of debt burden, which could be important for credit approval decisions.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, indicating industry-specific creditworthiness patterns that may affect approval decisions>
   Reasoning: Different industries may have systematically different credit behaviors. This feature captures industry-level credit trends that could be predictive of individual creditworthiness beyond personal characteristics.

1. IncomeLog: Income has extreme skewness (range 0-51,100, mean 797, std 3391) with many zeros. Log transformation handles this skewness, creates a more normal distribution, and helps models better capture income's relationship with credit approval without being dominated by outliers.

2. AgeDebtInteraction: Age and Debt both influence creditworthiness, but their combined effect might be non-additive. Older applicants with high debt might be riskier than younger ones with similar debt levels. This interaction captures these nuanced relationships that individual features might miss.

3. IndustryCreditScoreMean: Different industries have varying income stability and risk profiles. Calculating mean credit scores by industry provides industry-specific benchmarks that help contextualize individual credit scores relative to their professional peers, potentially revealing stronger predictive signals than raw credit scores alone.

These features address data quality issues (Income skewness), capture interactive effects (Age × Debt), and provide contextual benchmarks (industry-specific credit norms) - all valuable for improving credit card approval prediction.

2025-08-26 03:31:08,489 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeLog><log><Income><Logarithm of Income to handle extreme skewness and create a more normal distribution for better model performance>
   Reasoning: The Income feature has an extremely high standard deviation (3391.3944) compared to its mean (797.4082), indicating severe right skewness. Log transformation can normalize this distribution, making it easier for models to learn patterns and reducing the influence of extreme outliers.

2. <AgeDebtInteraction><multiply><Age><Debt><Interaction between Age and Debt to capture how debt burden affects different age groups differently in credit approval decisions>
   Reasoning: Younger individuals may handle debt differently than older, more established individuals. This interaction term can help capture the combined effect of age and debt level on credit card approval, which might not be captured by considering them separately.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, indicating industry-specific creditworthiness patterns that may affect approval decisions>
   Reasoning: Different industries may have systematic differences in creditworthiness. This feature captures the industry-level pattern of credit scores, which could be predictive of individual approval outcomes beyond just the individual's own credit score.

2025-08-26 03:33:45,127 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeLog><log><Income><Logarithm of Income to handle extreme skewness and create a more normal distribution for better model performance>
   - Reasoning: The Income feature has an extremely high standard deviation (3391.3944) compared to its median (5.0), indicating severe right-skewness with many outliers. Applying a log transformation can normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the influence of extreme values.

2. <AgeDebtInteraction><multiply><Age><Debt><Interaction between Age and Debt to capture how debt burden affects different age groups differently in credit approval decisions>
   - Reasoning: Younger individuals might handle debt differently than older, more established applicants. This multiplicative interaction term can help the model capture non-linear, age-dependent effects of debt on credit card approval that aren't captured by either feature alone.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, indicating industry-specific creditworthiness patterns that may affect approval decisions>
   - Reasoning: Different industries may have systematic differences in creditworthiness. This feature aggregates credit score information at the industry level, providing a contextual benchmark that could be more informative than individual credit scores alone for predicting approval outcomes.

2025-08-26 03:38:53,832 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <IncomeLog><log><Income><Logarithm of Income to handle extreme skewness and reduce the impact of outliers, creating a more normal distribution for better model performance>
   - Reasoning: The Income feature has an extremely high standard deviation (3391.39) compared to its median (5.0), indicating severe right skewness with many outliers. Applying a log transformation will help normalize this distribution, making it more suitable for linear models and reducing the undue influence of extreme values on the prediction.

2. <AgeDebtInteraction><multiply><Age><Debt><Interaction between Age and Debt to capture how debt burden affects different age groups differently in credit approval decisions>
   - Reasoning: Younger individuals might handle debt differently than older, more established individuals. This interaction term can help the model capture non-additive effects where the impact of debt on credit card approval varies by age, potentially revealing that debt is more concerning for certain age groups.

3. <IndustryCreditScoreMean><groupbythenmean><Industry><CreditScore><Mean credit score by industry, indicating industry-specific creditworthiness patterns that may affect approval decisions>
   - Reasoning: Different industries may have systematically different credit profiles. This feature captures the average creditworthiness within each industry sector, which could be an important signal beyond individual credit scores. For example, people in Financials might have higher average credit scores than those in other industries.
