   - Reasoning: Income has extremely high variance (std=3391 >> mean=797). Log transformation reduces skewness and helps models better capture income effects.

2. <Employed_CreditScore_Interaction><multiply><Employed><CreditScore><Interaction between employment status and credit score>
   - Reasoning: Employment status likely moderates the effect of credit score on approval. This interaction captures how credit score impacts change when applicant is employed.

3. <Industry_Income_Avg><groupbythenmean><Industry><Income><Average income by industry sector>
   - Reasoning: Different industries have different income patterns. Group averages provide contextual information about an applicant's economic segment beyond raw income.

Reasoning:  
1. Debt-to-Income is a crucial financial metric for credit decisions. Adding 1 to Income prevents division by zero while preserving ratio interpretation.
2. Age likely has non-linear effects on creditworthiness (e.g., young vs middle-aged vs seniors). Binning captures these patterns better than linear assumptions.
3. Target encoding for Industry converts categorical values into meaningful numerical values based on historical approval rates, which could reveal industry-specific risk patterns.

Reasoning:
1. CreditScore has high skewness (std=5.0964) with many zeros (median=0). Log transformation helps normalize distribution while handling zeros through +1 adjustment.
2. Combining PriorDefault and Employed through cross product creates meaningful interaction terms that may better capture risk profiles than individual features alone.
3. Grouping Income by Ethnicity can reveal demographic patterns that might be predictive of creditworthiness, complementing existing industry-based groupings.

Reasoning:
1. CreditScore shows extreme skewness (Q1=0, Q3=3, Mean=2.45) with many zeros. Binning helps capture non-linear thresholds where score impacts approval differently
2. Ethnicity is categorical but hasn't been effectively utilized. Target encoding provides numerical representation while preserving predictive power
3. PriorDefault and Employed are both binary flags whose combination may indicate different risk profiles than either feature alone

<Ethnicity_Debt_Mean><groupbythenmean><Ethnicity><Debt><Average debt by ethnicity group to capture demographic borrowing patterns without target encoding>

Reasoning:
1. CreditScore has extreme skew (std=5.1 > mean=2.46) - sqrt transformation handles skew better than log for zero-heavy data while maintaining interpretability
2. PriorDefault and Employed are both binary features - cross product creates meaningful interaction terms that capture compounded risk factors (e.g., unemployed with prior default = highest risk)
3. Ethnicity shows potential patterns but target encoding was rejected - groupwise debt means capture demographic financial behavior without direct target leakage
