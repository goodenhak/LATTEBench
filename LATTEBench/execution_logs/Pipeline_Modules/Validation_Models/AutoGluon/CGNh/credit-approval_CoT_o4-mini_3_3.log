2025-08-26 09:51:24,750 - INFO - LLM Output: Below are three feature‐engineering ideas aimed at capturing age‐based credit patterns, financial leverage, and the moderating effect of employment on credit scores:

1. Mean Credit Score by Age Group  
   Reasoning: Different age cohorts may have systematically different credit histories. Aggregating credit score at the age‐group level can reveal these patterns.

2. Debt‐to‐Income Ratio  
   Reasoning: While we already have Income/Debt, the inverse (Debt/Income) directly measures an applicant’s financial leverage and relative debt burden.

3. Employment‐Weighted Credit Score  
   Reasoning: Holding a job likely changes how much weight we place on a given credit score. Multiplying credit score by employment status accentuates creditworthiness for employed applicants.
