1. \<credit_age_wealth_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<age\>\<Ratio of credit amount to the age, providing insight into the financial pressure at different life stages and potential future earning capacity\>

   Reasoning: This feature captures the burden of credit relative to an applicant's age, providing insights into how much credit a person takes compared to their age, reflecting potential long-term financial commitment and maturity.

2. \<employment_check_cross\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<checking_status\>\<Interaction between employment status and checking account status to evaluate the combined impact on financial stability and the ability to manage short-term finances\>

   Reasoning: This feature examines how different employment statuses combined with checking account statuses could impact an individual's financial stability and creditworthiness, providing a more nuanced understanding of financial management capability.

3. \<savings_installment_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<savings_status\>\<installment_commitment\>\<Ratio of savings status to installment commitment, illustrating the proportion of savings relative to monthly financial obligations\>

   Reasoning: By examining the relationship between savings and monthly installments, this feature provides insight into the cushioning effect of savings against ongoing financial commitments, reflecting on the potential stress in meeting monthly obligations.

2025-08-25 12:58:08,228 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible feature engineering steps using the specified operators. These steps aim to improve the model's performance by creating features that capture essential aspects of creditworthiness and financial stability.

1. Crossing Credit History and Checking Status: 
   - This captures the relationship between an applicant's historical credit behavior and their current liquidity, revealing financial stability.
   html
   <credit_history_checking_cross><cross><credit_history><checking_status><Interaction between credit history and checking account status to assess historical behavior and current liquidity>
   

2. Ratio of Credit Amount to Savings: 
   - This ratio demonstrates the financial burden of a credit amount relative to savings, providing insights into the applicant's repayment capacity and financial management.
   html
   <credit_savings_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><savings_status><Ratio of credit amount to savings status to evaluate financial burden>
   

3. Label Encoding of Personal Status: 
   - Encoding the personal status can provide numerical significance to social factors like marriage or dependency, influencing financial obligations and stability.
   html
   <personal_status_encoded><label_encode><personal_status><Numerical encoding of personal status to capture socio-economic influence on creditworthiness>
   
   
These features are designed to enrich the data, helping the model identify patterns related to credit approval more accurately. Each step leverages interactions or transformations that highlight potential financial behaviors or pressures that may correlate with credit decisions.

2025-08-25 12:59:28,914 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the operations:

1. <credit_instalment_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio of credit amount to installment commitment to capture the burden of credit relative to income and potential financial strain>

   * Reasoning: This feature helps understand how a credit amount relates to the individual's monthly financial commitment, indicating their ability to manage financial obligations in the context of their overall income.

2. <age_savings_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Numerical encoding of savings status to assess the impact of savings on financial stability and creditworthiness in terms of age>

   * Reasoning: By numerically encoding the savings status, we can quantify its relationship with other features such as age. Understanding how different savings categories differ in terms of credit risk relative to age can be beneficial.

3. <employment_property_cross><cross><employment><property_magnitude><Interaction between employment status and property ownership to evaluate the combined impact on financial stability and asset management>

   * Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between employment status and property ownership, which may have a significant bearing on an individual's overall financial health and asset management ability. It can provide additional context for evaluating credit risk.

2025-08-25 13:01:57,176 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_residence_cross><cross><credit_history><residence_since><Interaction between credit history and duration of residence to assess historical financial behavior and residential stability>
   
   Reasoning: The stability of residence might correlate with creditworthiness, especially in the context of one's credit history. Combining these two features can provide insights into whether a stable living situation impacts payment behavior or credit approval likelihood.

2. <credit_amount_savings_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><age_savings_encoded><Ratio of credit amount to age-adjusted savings status to assess potential financial risk against savings management capability>

   Reasoning: The credit amount, in relation to savings indicated by age, could provide insights into financial risk. Higher credit requests relative to limited savings might suggest a higher credit risk, especially if the applicant is younger. This feature could aid in identifying those at risk of over-leveraging.

3. <employment_credit_combined><cross><employment><purpose><Interaction between employment status and credit purpose to evaluate how employment affects the necessity or risk of particular credit purposes>

   Reasoning: Understanding if certain employment types correlate with specific credit purposes may provide insights into employment stability and credit necessity or risk. For instance, employed individuals might apply for loans differently compared to unemployed individuals, potentially impacting risk assessments.

2025-08-25 13:03:45,562 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <employment_savings_cross><cross><employment><savings_status><Interaction between employment status and savings account status to assess how employment duration interacts with savings level for creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Combining employment status with savings status can provide insight into how financial stability (in terms of savings) interacts with job duration or stability. This may help assess the applicant's ability to handle financial burdens over time.

2. <credit_amount_installment_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio of credit amount to installment commitment, capturing credit burden relative to income and providing a measure of monthly financial pressure>
   - Reasoning: This feature quantifies the burden that the credit installment represents in relation to the credit amount requested. It can help identify applicants who may struggle to manage high installment amounts compared to their total requested credit, indicating potential financial strain.

3. <employed_dependents_cross><cross><employment><num_dependents><Interaction between employment status and number of dependents to evaluate how employment stability interacts with financial obligations towards dependents>
   - Reasoning: Employment stability combined with the number of dependents can provide insights into the applicant's capability to meet financial commitments, factoring in the added responsibility of dependents. This may directly impact creditworthiness and the risk of default.

2025-08-25 13:05:02,973 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<loan_amount_logarithm\>\<log\>\<credit_amount\>\<Logarithmic transformation of credit amount to reduce skewness and emphasize relative differences in credit size>
  
   Reasoning: The credit amount often has a skewed distribution, which can impact prediction quality. Applying a logarithmic transformation can help normalize the distribution, making the data more suitable for linear models.

2. \<employ_savings_interaction\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<savings_status\>\<Interaction between employment status and savings account status to assess the combined impact on financial stability and credit management>

   Reasoning: By combining employment and savings statuses, we examine how different employment durations interact with levels of savings, which can provide additional insights into the applicant's creditworthiness. Different combinations might reveal high- or low-risk groups.

3. \<payment_plan_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<other_payment_plans\>\<Numerical encoding of other installment plans to quantify the impact of different payment arrangements on credit decision outcomes>

   Reasoning: Encoding categorical features like 'other_payment_plans' can help machine learning models better capture the potential impact of various installment plans on creditworthiness. This quantifies the influence of choosing a particular payment method on financial behavior.
