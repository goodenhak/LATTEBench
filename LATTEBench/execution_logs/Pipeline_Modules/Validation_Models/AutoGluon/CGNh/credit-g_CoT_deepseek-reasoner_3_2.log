2025-08-25 15:47:04,388 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <age_binned_label><label_encode><age_binned><Label encoded age bins to capture non-linear effects of age on credit decisions>
   Reasoning: Age shows a wide range (19-75) with potential non-linear impacts on creditworthiness. Binning and label encoding can help the model capture these patterns without assuming linearity.

2. <credit_per_age><divide><credit_amount><age><Ratio of credit amount to age, indicating credit burden relative to life stage>
   Reasoning: Younger applicants with high credit amounts may be riskier. This ratio combines two fundamental numerical features to create a meaningful risk indicator.

3. <personal_status_housing_cross><cross><personal_status><housing><Interaction between personal status and housing situation, as both are important socio-economic factors>
   Reasoning: Marital status and housing type (own/rent/free) likely have combined effects on financial stability. A cross feature captures these interactions better than treating them separately.

These steps focus on creating interpretable features that address potential non-linearities and interactions between key demographic and financial variables, which are often important in credit scoring models.

To improve the model's performance for predicting credit approval, I propose three new features that capture non-linear relationships, interactions between risk and loan characteristics, and grouped summaries based on employment status. These features are designed to provide additional signals that may not be fully captured by existing features.

1. Age Binning: Age is likely to have a non-linear relationship with credit approval, as very young or old individuals may exhibit different risk profiles. Binning age into categories allows the model to capture these effects without assuming linearity.
2. Purpose-Credit Interaction: The purpose target encoding reflects the risk associated with the loan purpose, and credit amount indicates the loan size. Multiplying these combines risk and size into a single feature, potentially enhancing predictive power.
3. Mean Duration by Employment: Employment status influences creditworthiness, and loan duration may vary by employment group. This feature summarizes typical loan terms per employment category, which could correlate with approval likelihood.

### Proposed Features in Format

1. <age_bin><bin><age><Binned age into categories to capture non-linear age effects>
2. <purpose_credit_interaction><multiply><purpose_target><credit_amount><Interaction between purpose target encoding and credit amount to combine purpose risk with loan size>
3. <mean_duration_by_employment><groupbythenmean><employment><duration><Mean duration of credit by employment status, indicating typical loan term based on employment>

3. <payment_intensity><divide><monthly_payment><duration><Monthly payment intensity relative to loan duration>

Reasoning:
1. Age shows non-linear relationships with credit risk. Sigmoid transformation captures threshold effects where risk peaks in middle age and decreases at both extremes, complementing existing linear age representation.
2. Square root transform handles credit amount skewness differently than log, potentially capturing relationships at lower credit ranges more effectively while maintaining interpretability.
3. Payment intensity (monthly payment divided by duration) measures payment burden concentration - higher values indicate more compressed repayment schedules which may correlate with different risk profiles than separate payment/duration features.
