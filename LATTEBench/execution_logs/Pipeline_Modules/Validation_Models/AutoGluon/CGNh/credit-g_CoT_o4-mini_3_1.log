Reasoning:  
- Monthly payment rate captures borrower’s per-period burden (credit amount spread over duration).  
- Ratio of requested amount to historical average for the same credit history highlights outliers.  
- Binning duration into categories can model non‐linear risk patterns across short/medium/long loans.
