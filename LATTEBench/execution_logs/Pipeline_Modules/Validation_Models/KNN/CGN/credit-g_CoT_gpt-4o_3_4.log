2025-11-11 12:50:46,367 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, let's propose three steps:

1. <credit_amount_sqrt><sqrt><credit_amount><Square_root_of_credit_amount>
   Reasoning: Applying a square root transformation to the credit_amount may help normalize its distribution, thereby potentially improving model performance.

2. <employment_duration_ratio><ratio><employment><duration><Ratio_of_employment_to_duration>
   Reasoning: Creating a ratio between employment (categorical, converted to numerical) and duration can be informative of the stability and length of employment relative to the loan duration. This could impact creditworthiness judgments.

3. <checking_status_credit_history><cross><checking_status><credit_history><Interaction_between_checking_status_and_credit_history>
   Reasoning: Interaction between checking account status and credit history can provide detailed insight into financial behavior and credit management, useful for predicting credit approval probability.

2025-11-11 12:50:55,737 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential steps for feature engineering:

1. <age_experience_cross><cross><age><employment_label_encoded><Interaction_between_age_and_employment_to_categorize_experience_level>
   - Reasoning: Interactions between age and employment can capture nuanced information about the experience level of the applicant, which might impact their creditworthiness.

2. <credit_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment_to_gauge_credit_burden_on_income>
   - Reasoning: Calculating a ratio of credit amount to installment commitment can provide insights into the relative burden of credit on the applicant’s income, which is a crucial factor in determining their ability to manage additional credit.

3. <savings_status_encoded><label_encode><savings_status><Encoded_numeric_representation_of_savings_status>
   - Reasoning: Encoding the savings status can help the model understand the effect of savings without losing the ordinal information, which could be significant in credit eligibility assessment.
