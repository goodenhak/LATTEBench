2025-11-11 12:54:48,423 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<duration_zscore\>\<zscore\>\<duration\>\<Z-score normalized duration to assess relative credit term length\>  
   - Justification: Z-score normalization can help standardize the duration feature, making it easier for the model to learn patterns across different scales of credit duration.

2. \<credit_risk_score\>\<label_encode\>\<credit_history\>\<Encoded credit history to quantify credit risk\>  
   - Justification: Converting categorical credit history into a numerical representation may help the model better evaluate the level of risk associated with the applicant’s past credit performance.

3. \<employment_duration_combined\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<duration\>\<Combined employment status and credit duration to capture potential creditworthiness based on employment history\>  
   - Justification: Combining employment status with the duration of the credit could provide insights into an applicant's creditworthiness, as stable employment may correlate with an ability to maintain credit commitments over time.

   Reasoning: This operation leverages feature interaction between credit duration and savings history, potentially revealing hidden patterns that affect credit risk assessment.

2. <credit_savings_duration_ratio><ratio><duration><savings_history_combined><Ratio_between_credit_duration_and_savings_status_to_capture_relative_risk>
   
   Reasoning: This ratio can highlight how the duration of the credit may influence risk relative to the individual's savings status, offering a nuanced view into credit risk dynamics.

3. <wealth_index><plus><checking_status><savings_status><Aggregate_financial_information_to_create_a_wealth_index_for_creditworthiness_assessment>
   
   Reasoning: Combining checking and savings statuses into a single index may provide a better overall representation of an individual's financial situation, potentially improving credit predictions.
