   *Reasoning:* Combining employment status with savings account status might highlight financial stability, which can be crucial for assessing creditworthiness.

2. \<age_property_magnitude_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<age\>\<property_magnitude\>\<relationship_between_age_and_property_to_identify_financial_maturity\>

   *Reasoning:* The ratio of age to property magnitude can give insights into financial maturity—older individuals with more substantial property might be more stable and responsible borrowers.

3. \<credit_amount_commitment\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<installment_commitment\>\<credit_amount_relative_to_installment_commitment\>

   *Reasoning:* Evaluating the ratio of credit amount to installment commitment can help detect situations where large loans might overly strain disposable income, indicating risk.

1. <credit_history_label><label_encode><credit_history><numerical_representation_of_credit_history_for_better_handling_in_model>  
   *Reasoning*: Converting the categorical credit history feature into a numerical form can help machine learning models capture the order and significance of different credit history states, providing more insight into creditworthiness.

2. <employment_duration_ratio><divide><duration_employment_cross><residence_since><ratio_of_employment_to_residence_for_insight_into_stability>  
   *Reasoning*: Calculating the ratio between the duration of employment and current residence can provide insights into the applicant's stability. A higher ratio could indicate a more stable occupation relative to living situation, possibly impacting credit decisions.

3. <total_commitment_ratio><plus><installment_commitment><existing_credits><total_financial_commitments_as_percentage_of_income>  
   *Reasoning*: Adding the installment commitment percentage to the number of existing credits provides a measure of an individual's total financial obligations relative to income. It can indicate the overall financial burden and impact the credit decision.
