   - This feature represents the amount of credit requested per month of the credit duration. A higher ratio might indicate a higher risk or urgency for credit.

2. \<employment_stability\>cross\<employment\>\<residence_since\>\<employment_and_residence_cross_feature\>
   - By combining employment and duration of residence, we can get an indicator of stability. Longer employment combined with longer residence could denote financial stability.

3. \<property_purpose_cross\>cross\<property_magnitude\>\<purpose\>\<property_and_purpose_cross_feature\>
   - This feature captures the relationship between the type of property owned and the purpose of the credit. Certain combinations might indicate higher or lower credit risk trends.

   - Reasoning: Different purposes might have different typical durations associated with them. Creating an interaction between purpose and duration can help capture these patterns, providing the model with more context-specific information.

2. \<credit_savings_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<savings_status\>\<ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings\>  
   - Reasoning: This feature represents the relation between the amount of credit requested and the individual's savings status. This can indicate the financial behavior of individuals in terms of risk assessment, where higher ratios might indicate more risk.

3. \<credit_history_encoded\>\<label_encode\>\<credit_history\>\<encoded_credit_history_values\>  
   - Reasoning: Label encoding the credit history can transform categorical data into numerical format, preserving ordinal information. This helps in improving the predictive power as the sequential nature of credit history (e.g., 'all paid' being better than 'critical/other existing credit') is captured numerically.

3. <purpose_credit_amount_interaction><cross><purpose><credit_amount><Interaction_between_credit_purpose_and_amount>

Explanation of the steps:

1. employment_duration_ratio: By examining the ratio of employment duration to credit duration, we can gain insights into how stable the individual's income might be compared to the commitment period for the credit. Longer employment relative to credit duration might indicate greater stability and a higher likelihood of managing credit effectively.

2. credit_amount_installment_ratio: Analyzing the proportion of credit amount to installment commitment provides a view of the individual's credit burden relative to their disposable income. A higher ratio might indicate a heavy burden, which could impact the likelihood of receiving a credit positively or negatively based on other factors.

3. purpose_credit_amount_interaction: Interactions between categorical and numerical features can often uncover hidden patterns. By crossing the purpose of credit with the credit amount, we may capture how different purposes align with varying amounts, potentially affecting credit approval chances.

   * Reasoning: This feature reflects the intensity of the credit requested per month. A higher ratio may suggest higher risk, as the borrower wants more credit over a similar period, indicating potential liquidity stress. 

2. \<age_employment_experience\>\<plus\>\<label_encode(employment)\>\<age\>\<Combined measure of age and employment experience\>
   * Reasoning: By combining age with employment, we have an indicator of financial stability and income potential. Older individuals with significant employment experience may pose lower credit risk.

3. \<credit_history_checking\>\<cross\>\<label_encode(credit_history)\>\<label_encode(checking_status)\>\<Interaction of credit history and checking account status\>
   * Reasoning: The interaction of credit history and checking account status can reveal nuanced creditworthiness details. For example, someone with a good credit history but a negative balance in their checking account might still be a risk. Interactions can better capture such subtleties.

   Reasoning: Binning the age feature can help group loan applicants into broader age categories to capture patterns in credit approval based on age groups.

2. \<credit_duration_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<credit_amount\>\<duration\>\<Credit_amount_to_duration_ratio\>  
   Reasoning: The ratio of credit amount to duration can help in understanding the borrower's repayment capacity relative to the loan size and the period, as higher ratios might indicate higher risk.

3. \<credit_history_employment_cross\>\<cross\>\<credit_history\>\<employment\>\<Interaction_between_credit_history_and_employment_status\>  
   Reasoning: Understanding the interaction between a person's credit history and their employment status can provide insights into creditworthiness, since stable employment and good credit history might lead to higher credit approval chances.

2025-11-11 13:01:31,470 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 1364, 'completion_tokens': 229, 'total_tokens': 1593}
2025-11-11 13:01:31,470 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <employment_label><label_encode><employment><Convert_employment_to_numerical_values>
   - Reasoning: By converting categorical features like employment into numerical values through label encoding, we allow the model to recognize ordinal relationships, which can be beneficial for improving its predictive capabilities. Employment duration might be positively correlated with creditworthiness.

2. <checking_property_cross><cross><checking_status><property_magnitude><Combine_checking_account_status_and_property_type>
   - Reasoning: The combination of checking_status and property_magnitude could provide insights into the financial stability and asset ownership of individuals, which could influence their credit approval chances. This cross-feature may capture complex interactions between financial reserves and property holdings.

3. <age_zscore><zscore><age><Standardize_age_with_zscore>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing age using z-score normalization can help in centering the data around the mean and making it unitless. This is useful for ensuring that age is on a comparable scale to other numerical features, potentially improving model performance by minimizing scale differences.

   - Reasoning: By crossing the checking property and employment status, we can create a feature that potentially uncovers interactions between financial stability and job security. This could reveal insights in predicting credit approval patterns.

2. <credit_amount_duration_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Understand_the_relationship_between_credit_amount_and_loan_duration_to_predict_approval_chances>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of credit amount to duration may reflect the client's ability to manage and repay their loan within the given term. A high ratio might indicate an overly ambitious credit request, which could impact approval odds.

3. <age_employment_product><multiply><age><employment_label><Evaluate_combined_influence_of_age_and_employment_years_on_credit_decision>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying age with employment_label allows the exploration of the joint influence of a person’s maturity and employment stability on credit outcomes. This product could unveil age-based financial behavior in relation to employment duration influencing credit risk.
