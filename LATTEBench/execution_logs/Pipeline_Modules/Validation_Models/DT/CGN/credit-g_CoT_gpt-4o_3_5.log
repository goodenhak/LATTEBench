   Reasoning: By combining age_zscore and property_magnitude, we can analyze how a person's relative age in the population range interacts with their property ownership status in contributing to credit decisions.

2. <duration_credit_amount_ratio><ratio><duration><credit_amount><Determining_the_ratio_of_duration_to_credit_amount_to_understand_credit_term_vs_amount_risk>

   Reasoning: The ratio of duration to credit amount could help in understanding if longer credit terms are associated with higher credit amounts, potentially serving as an indicator of credit risk.

3. <job_credit_history_interaction><cross><job><credit_history><Interaction_of_job_and_credit_history_to_evaluate_employment_and_credit_risk>

   Reasoning: By crossing job and credit_history, the feature captures how employment status interacts with past credit performance, helping to predict future credit behavior.

   Reasoning: Categorical features can sometimes be more predictive when transformed into numerical form, as this allows for their relationships to be more readily captured by models that rely on numerical computations.

2. \<age_scaled\>\<minmax\>\<age\>\<Scaled age feature\>

   Reasoning: Normalizing or scaling numerical features like age can improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms, making it easier for them to learn relationships between input features and the target variable, especially if the model is sensitive to feature magnitude.

3. \<credit_history_foreign_worker_cross\>\<cross\>\<credit_history\>\<foreign_worker\>\<Interaction feature between credit history and foreign worker status to capture any joint effect on creditworthiness\>

   Reasoning: Cross features can capture interactions between two categorical features, which might provide additional predictive power if certain combinations of categories have a different impact on credit receipt than each category individually.

2025-11-11 13:06:30,275 - INFO - LLM Output: Here's a set of three possible steps for generating additional features using the given operators:

1. <duration_age_ratio><ratio><duration><age><Explore_relationship_between_loan_duration_and_borrower_age_to_improve_risk_assessment>

   Reasoning: The relationship between loan duration and the borrower's age could impact credit risk. By exploring their ratio, we might discover patterns where certain age-duration combinations are linked to higher or lower credit risk.

2. <property_job_cross><cross><property_magnitude><job><Capture_interaction_between_property_owned_and_job_type_to_better_assess_financial_stability>

   Reasoning: The type of property owned and the borrower's job type can be crucial indicators of creditworthiness. Cross-features can help capture potential interactions between these categories, offering insights into financial stability and credit risk.

3. <age_residence_elapse><elapsed_time><age><residence_since><Calculate_elapsed_age_since_residence_start_to_identify_stability_patterns>

   Reasoning: The time since a borrower started their residence can indicate stability. By calculating the elapsed time since residence start, we can evaluate how long they've been stable at a given address from a certain age, which could relate to creditworthiness and risk behavior.
