3. <credit_history_encoded><label_encode><credit_history><NumericalRepresentationOfCreditHistory>

Explanation:
1. Converting the categorical 'checking_status' into numerical form could help the model understand the ordinal nature or distinct categories of checking account status, which may correlate with credit risk.
2. Concatenating 'job' and 'employment' creates a new combined feature that captures the interplay between a person's job type and employment duration, possibly revealing unique profiles related to creditworthiness.
3. Similarly, converting 'credit_history' to a numerical format potentially aids in capturing the ordinal categories or distinct types of credit history. This might be crucial for understanding the historical behavior of credit usage, which is often a strong predictor of future credit dependability.

2025-11-11 12:59:39,039 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps for generating new features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_amount_zscore><zscore><credit_amount><Z-score_standardized_credit_amount>  
   Reasoning: By applying a z-score standardization to credit_amount, the model can better capture anomalies or outliers, and facilitate comparison across different scales which may improve predictions based on the amount of credit requested.

2. <employment_label><label_encode><employment><Numerical_representation_of_employment_category>  
   Reasoning: Converting the employment categorical variable to a numerical form through label encoding allows the model to quantify different employment categories, potentially making it easier to differentiate risk profiles based on employment status.

3. <checking_savings_cross><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Combined_checking_and_savings_status>  
   Reasoning: Crossing checking_status and savings_status can create a combined profile of an applicant's liquid financial state, providing a nuanced view that might reveal important patterns about creditworthiness that are not evident when considering these features independently.

These feature engineering steps aim to refine and add depth to the existing feature set, offering more diverse insights into each applicant's financial behavior and characteristics, which should help the model's ability to predict credit decisions more accurately.

2. <credit_savings_status><cross><credit_amount><savings_status><interaction_of_credit_and_savings_status>
   
   Reasoning: Create an interaction term between credit_amount and savings_status to capture the combined effect of requested credit and existing savings on the likelihood of receiving credit.

3. <credit_amount_scaled><minmax><credit_amount><credit_amount_scaled_between_0_and_1>
   
   Reasoning: Scale the credit_amount feature to a range of 0 to 1 to facilitate better numerical stability during model training and improve model performance by ensuring the feature is on a similar scale to others.
