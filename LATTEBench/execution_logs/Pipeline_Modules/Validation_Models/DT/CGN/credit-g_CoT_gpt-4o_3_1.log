You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, no checking, >=200, 0<=X<200]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [250, 18424], Q1 = 1393.0, Median = 2302.5, Q3 = 3926.0, Mean = 3289.6367, Std = 2873.9759
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [used car, radio/tv, new car, business, furniture/equipment, repairs, other, education, retraining, domestic appliance]
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [all paid, existing paid, critical/other existing credit, delayed previously, no credits/all paid]
- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9983, Std = 1.1182
- property_cross_housing: Interaction_of_property_magnitude_and_housing_to_capture_additional_information_on_financial_stability (categorical), categories = [car_rent, life insurance_own, real estate_own, life insurance_rent, car_own, no known property_for free, no known property_own, real estate_rent, no known property_rent, life insurance_for free, car_for free, real estate_for free]
