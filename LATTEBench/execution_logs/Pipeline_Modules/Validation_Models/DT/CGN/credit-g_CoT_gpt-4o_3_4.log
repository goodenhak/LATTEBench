   Reasoning: Combining credit history and checking status can provide more insight into an individual's financial stability and payment behavior, which is critical for assessing credit risk.

2. \<employment_purpose_encoded\>label_encode\<employment_purpose_cross\>\<Encodes_employment_and_credit_purpose_interaction_as_a_numerical_feature\>

   Reasoning: Encoding this categorical feature into a numerical one could help the model better utilize it, as numerical relationships between different interactions might reveal patterns not evident in the categorical form.

3. \<installment_burden\>multiply\<installment_commitment\>\<credit_installment_ratio\>\<Determines_how_installment_commitment_relates_to_credit_payment_capacity\>

   Reasoning: Multiplying the installment commitment by the credit installment ratio can quantify the burden of credit repayment relative to the customer's income commitment, giving insights into their ability to manage credit payments efficiently.

2025-11-11 13:04:17,571 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<checking_status_encoded\><label_encode\><checking_status\>\<Encoded\numerical\version\of\checking_status,\to\capture\ordinal\information\for\analysis\>
   
   Reasoning: Encoding categorical variables such as 'checking_status' can help incorporate the ordinal nature into models that work better with numerical input, like linear models or distance-based algorithms.

2. \<credit_to_income_ratio\><divide\><credit_amount\><installment_commitment\>\<A\normalized\measure\of\the\credit\amount\relative\to\installment\commitment,\providing\insight\into\repayment\easiness\>

   Reasoning: This feature captures the credit amount relative to the percentage of disposable income, which can be critical for assessing the ease or risk of repayment.

3. \<age_employment_interaction\><cross\><age\><employment\>\<To\capture\interactions\between\age\and\employment,\since\older\individuals\might\have\more\stable\employment\records,\affecting\credit\worthiness\>

   Reasoning: Interactions between age and employment can uncover relationships suggesting stability in employment, possibly influencing the likelihood of receiving credit.
