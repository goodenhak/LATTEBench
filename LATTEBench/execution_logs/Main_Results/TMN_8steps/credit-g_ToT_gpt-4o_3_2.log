You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, no checking, 0<=X<200, >=200]

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, no checking, 0<=X<200, >=200]
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, 500<=X<1000, no known savings, 100<=X<500, >=1000]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [339, 18424], Q1 = 1388.75, Median = 2339.5, Q3 = 3960.75, Mean = 3304.7150, Std = 2810.4781
- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 72], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 20.9267, Std = 11.9942
- credit_amount_per_duration: credit_amount_per_month_feature (numerical), range = [24.055554219135875, 2482.666252888958], Q1 = 87.3357097116329, Median = 131.91457756164095, Q3 = 212.70832557964437, Mean = 171.9924, Std = 171.3701
- norm_duration: standardized_duration_feature (numerical), range = [-1.4112365566456375, 4.258165915896901], Q1 = -0.7442480304641625, Median = -0.2440066358280562, Q3 = 0.2562347588080501, Mean = 0.0000, Std = 1.0000
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [radio/tv, new car, used car, education, business, furniture/equipment, other, repairs, domestic appliance, retraining]
- existing_credits: Number of existing credits at this bank (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 1.3850, Std = 0.5452
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [all paid, critical/other existing credit, existing paid, no credits/all paid, delayed previously]
- residence_since: Present residence since X years (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.8033, Std = 1.1285
- credit_duration_interaction: Interaction_feature_between_credit_amount_and_duration (categorical), categories = [1546_24, 1459_15, ..., 1048_10]
- num_dependents: Number of people being liable to provide maintenance for (numerical), range = [1, 2], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 1.1433, Std = 0.3507
- personal_status: Personal status (married, single,...) and sex (categorical), categories = [male single, female div/dep/mar, male mar/wid, male div/sep]
- other_parties: Other debtors / guarantors (categorical), categories = [guarantor, none, co applicant]
- property_magnitude: Property (e.g. real estate) (categorical), categories = [car, real estate, life insurance, no known property]
- employment_encoded: Encoded_numerical_representation_of_employment_status (numerical), range = [0, 4], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 3.0, Mean = 1.4817, Std = 1.3587

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
