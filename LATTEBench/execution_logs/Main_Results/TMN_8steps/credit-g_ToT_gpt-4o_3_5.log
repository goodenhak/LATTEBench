Devise the best possible solution for the task:
Possible next three steps:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 60], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 20.6050, Std = 11.9566
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [276, 18424], Q1 = 1346.75, Median = 2264.0, Q3 = 3777.75, Mean = 3166.3933, Std = 2756.3158
- job: Job (categorical), categories = [skilled, unemp/unskilled non res, unskilled resident, high qualif/self emp/mgmt]
- property_magnitude: Property (e.g. real estate) (categorical), categories = [car, life insurance, no known property, real estate]
- residence_since: Present residence since X years (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.8817, Std = 1.1134
- other_parties: Other debtors / guarantors (categorical), categories = [none, guarantor, co applicant]
- age: Age in years (numerical), range = [19, 74], Q1 = 27.0, Median = 33.5, Q3 = 42.0, Mean = 35.8917, Std = 11.4752
- employment: Present employment, in number of years. (categorical), categories = [4<=X<7, >=7, unemployed, 1<=X<4, <1]
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [existing paid, critical/other existing credit, no credits/all paid, all paid, delayed previously]
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, >=1000, no known savings, 100<=X<500, 500<=X<1000]
- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9617, Std = 1.1086

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
