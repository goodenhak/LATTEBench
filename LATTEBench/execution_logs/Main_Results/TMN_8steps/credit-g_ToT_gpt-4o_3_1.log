Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, no checking, >=200, 0<=X<200]
- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 60], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 21.1717, Std = 11.9703
- credit_purpose_cross: Combination_of_credit_purpose_and_credit_history (categorical), categories = [used car_all paid, radio/tv_existing paid, ..., used car_no credits/all paid]
- other_payment_plans: Other installment plans (banks, stores) (categorical), categories = [bank, none, stores]
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [used car, radio/tv, new car, business, furniture/equipment, repairs, other, education, retraining, domestic appliance]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [250, 18424], Q1 = 1393.0, Median = 2302.5, Q3 = 3926.0, Mean = 3289.6367, Std = 2873.9759
- credit_amount_log: Log_transformed_credit_amount (numerical), range = [5.521460921862246, 9.821409441554795], Q1 = 7.23921497449768, Median = 7.741750744985567, Q3 = 8.275364643349928, Mean = 7.7959, Std = 0.7706
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, no known savings, 100<=X<500, >=1000, 500<=X<1000]
- own_telephone: Telephone (categorical), categories = [none, yes]
- housing: Housing (rent, own,...) (categorical), categories = [rent, own, for free]
- num_dependents: Number of people being liable to provide maintenance for (numerical), range = [1, 2], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 1.1600, Std = 0.3669
- employment_label: Encoded_employment_status (numerical), range = [0, 4], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 3.0, Mean = 1.5067, Std = 1.3588
- credit_amount_x_duration: Ratio of credit_amount to duration as a proxy for credit pressure over time (numerical), range = [24.055554219135875, 2482.666252888958], Q1 = 86.31943245447718, Median = 130.74165468069555, Q3 = 201.01457369564284, Mean = 168.3365, Std = 174.1715
- credit_history_encoded: Encoded_credit_history (numerical), range = [0, 4], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 3.0, Mean = 2.2450, Std = 1.0473

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
