2025-09-21 17:08:48,933 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Age_Binned><bin><Age><Binned_version_of_age>
   - Reasoning: Creating bins from continuous numerical features like age can help capture age groups that might be more likely to be successful in applying for a credit card, thus improving model performance.

2. <Employment_Industry_Cross><cross><Employed><Industry><Interaction_of_employment_status_with_industry>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between employment status and industry could highlight sectors that provide stable employment, making applicants more likely to succeed in credit applications. Cross features often capture complex relationships between categorical values.

3. <Income_to_Age_Ratio><ratio><Income><Age><Ratio_of_income_to_age>
   - Reasoning: This feature calculates the ratio of income to age, which may indicate financial maturity and increase predictive power for credit card application success. Applicants with higher income relative to their age might be viewed more favorably in terms of creditworthiness.

2025-09-21 17:08:53,223 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Debt_to_Income_Ratio><divide><Debt><Income><Ratio_of_debt_to_income>
   - Reasoning: While the existing feature 'Income_to_Debt_Ratio' captures the relationship between these two variables, having the complementary 'Debt_to_Income_Ratio' could provide additional insights, especially if some credit decisions are more heavily influenced by debt levels relative to income.

2. <Age_YearsEmployed_Interaction><multiply><Age><YearsEmployed><Interaction_of_age_and_years_employed>
   - Reasoning: Combining age with years employed could reveal dynamics of maturity in the workforce, capturing profiles of individuals who have more stable employment histories. This might be positively correlated with credit card application success due to economic stability.

3. <PriorDefault_Married_Concat><concat><PriorDefault><Married><Concatenation_of_prior_default_and_marital_status>
   - Reasoning: By examining the combined effect of having prior defaults and marital status, we could reveal patterns of fiscal behavior or stability. This feature might help identify individuals who, despite a history of defaults, have a different credit behavior due to marital status.

2025-09-21 17:08:58,571 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the given operators, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <YearsEmployed_Age_Ratio><divide><YearsEmployed><Age><Ratio_of_years_employed_to_age>
   - Reasoning: By creating a ratio of years employed to age, we can capture a person's stability and experience relative to their age. This might highlight individuals who are more settled in their careers at a younger age, which could correlate with financial reliability and hence an increased likelihood of credit card application success.

2. <Employed_Married_Interaction><cross><Employed><Married><Interaction_of_employment_and_marital_status>
   - Reasoning: Cross the employment status with marital status to capture an interaction effect that could influence creditworthiness. For instance, being married and employed might suggest a more stable financial situation than either attribute alone, potentially affecting the likelihood of being approved for a credit card.

3. <Income_by_Citizen_Avg><groupbythenmean><Citizen><Income><Average_income_within_citizenship_status>
   - Reasoning: Using groupbythenmean with the Citizen feature can provide insights into how income varies across different citizenship statuses. This can identify patterns in income levels related to citizenship that might be relevant to credit card application success, for example, differences in economic stability.

By creating a feature representing the ratio of debt to age, you obtain a measure of financial burden relative to life stage. This could highlight individuals either living beyond their means or who have accumulated little debt relative to their age, potentially impacting creditworthiness.

2. \<Employed_Ethnicity_Interaction\> \<cross\> \<Employed\> \<Ethnicity\> \<Interaction_of_employment_status_with_ethnicity\>  
Employment status and ethnicity can have multifaceted influences on credit applications due to economic and social factors. Combining them into an interaction term might capture nuanced effectual patterns aiding deeper insights into demographic impact on credit card success.

3. \<Income_to_YearsEmployed\> \<ratio\> \<Income\> \<YearsEmployed\> \<Income_relative_to_years_employed\>  
This feature provides insight into income stability and growth over employment duration. It can distinguish between high-income earners with short employment spans and those with consistent earnings over time, hinting at earning capacity rather than just income level.

2025-09-21 17:09:06,455 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Gender_Married_Interaction>cross<Gender><Married><Interaction_of_gender_and_marital_status>
   - Reasoning: Combining gender with marital status could provide insights into demographic trends that influence credit card application success rates. People of certain gender-marital combinations might have distinct credit behavior patterns.

2. <Scaled_Income>minmax<Income><Min_max_scaled_version_of_income>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the income feature can help the model treat income values more consistently, improving its capacity to identify patterns related to financial stability and credit card application success.

3. <Debt_to_CreditScore_Ratio>ratio<Debt><CreditScore><Ratio_of_debt_to_creditscore>
   - Reasoning: Creating a feature that directly compares debt to credit score provides a measure related to financial risk, potentially illuminating dependencies between outstanding debts and creditworthiness that can influence credit card application outcomes.
