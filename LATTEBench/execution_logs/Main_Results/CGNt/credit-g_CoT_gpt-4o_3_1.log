2025-09-02 15:08:50,630 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps that might improve the model's performance by capturing additional relevant information from the dataset:

1. <credit_history_slash_purpose_cross><cross><credit_history><purpose><Interaction between credit history and purpose to capture nuanced behavioral patterns in credit utilization>
   - Reasoning: Both credit history and purpose provide insight into a person's credit behavior and intended use of the loan. By capturing their interaction, we might discover specific types that are less or more likely to default, revealing new patterns and improving prediction performance.

2. <age_income_ratio><divide><age><installment_commitment><Age to installment commitment ratio indicating financial burden relative to age>
   - Reasoning: This new feature will provide a sense of the financial responsibility that someone has relative to their age. Younger individuals with high installment commitments relative to their peers might be at a higher risk for credit issues, hence this can capture age-related financial strain.

3. <employment_duration_interaction><multiply><employment_and_savings_status><duration><Interaction between employment-savings status and credit duration to assess long-term financial stability>
   - Reasoning: Employment and savings status gives an economic standing overview, while the credit duration reflects long-term financial decisions. Multiplying these captures the interaction of economic stability over a desired period, allowing insights into whether prolonged engagements with a bank align well with their economic status.
