2025-09-21 15:43:23,717 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 2068, 'completion_tokens': 220, 'total_tokens': 2288}
2025-09-21 15:43:23,717 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <age_category><bin><age><Categorizing age groups for credit risk profiling>
   - Reasoning: By segmenting age into categories (e.g., young, middle-aged, senior), we can better assess risk based on age-related behavioral and financial stability differences. Categorical age groupings could refine model predictions by capturing nuances related to life stages.

2. <income_to_savings_ratio><divide><credit_amount><checking_status><Ratio of credit amount to checking account status for financial insight>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines credit amount and checking status to provide a deeper understanding of the applicant's financial situation. Higher ratios could indicate financial stress, affecting creditworthiness, while lower ratios might suggest adequate financial reserves.

3. <employment_duration_score><label_encode><employment><Numerical encoding of employment duration for quantitative analysis>
   - Reasoning: Converting employment status into a numerical score allows for quantitative analysis, focusing more on employment stability, which is crucial for predicting a person's ability to repay credit. This transformation facilitates interactions with other numerical variables like credit amount and duration.

2025-09-21 15:43:38,254 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <credit_amount_duration_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio of credit amount to duration for financial commitment assessment>
   - Reasoning: By calculating the ratio of the credit amount to its duration, this feature pinpoints the monthly financial commitment imposed on the applicant. This helps understanding the applicant's financial capability, potentially leading to better credit risk prediction.

2. <age_savings_interaction><cross><age><savings_status><Interaction between age and savings status for enhanced credit profiling>
   - Reasoning: Combining age and savings status can provide insights into the applicant's financial maturity and savings habits. Younger applicants with high savings might be less risky, whereas older applicants with no or low savings might be riskier, impacting credit decisions.

3. <employment_credit_history_cross><cross><employment><credit_history><Cross feature of employment and credit history for nuanced creditworthiness insight>
   - Reasoning: Integrating employment status with credit history could reveal patterns related to job stability and past credit behavior, facilitating better assessment of the applicant's reliability and future interaction with credit obligations.

2025-09-21 15:43:42,429 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <employment_savings_label><label_encode><employment_savings_interaction><Numerical encoding for combined employment and savings status>
   - Reasoning: Label encoding the interaction between employment duration and savings status could provide a more nuanced view of an individual's financial stability, aiding the model in better credit prediction.
   
2. <total_credit_duration_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><duration><Ratio of total credit amount to duration for financial assessment>
   - Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of credit amount to duration gives an insight into the financial commitment associated with each credit, helping the model assess risk based on how burdensome the credit might be relative to the borrower's ability to repay.

3. <age_savings_interaction><cross><age_category><savings_status><Combination of age category and savings status for enhanced credit risk profiling>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the age category with savings status, capturing age-related financial habits and potential savings capacity, which can be crucial in determining creditworthiness.
