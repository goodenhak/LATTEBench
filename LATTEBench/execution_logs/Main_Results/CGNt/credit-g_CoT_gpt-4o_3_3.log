3. <age_employment_enc><label_encode><age_employment_interaction><encoded_version_of_age_employment_interaction>

Reasoning:

1. Duration to Credit Amount Ratio: By creating the <duration_credit_amount_ratio>, we capture how much time a person needs to pay back a given amount of credit. This can reveal financial habits, such as whether they're requesting a large amount of credit compared to the term of repayment, which can be indicative of risk.

2. Credit History and Property Combination: Credit history provides context about an individual's past credit behaviors. Combining it with property magnitude through <credit_history_property_combination> helps us understand how past credit behaviors are potentially mitigated or exacerbated by existing properties, illuminating risk tolerance.

3. Age and Employment Interaction Encoding: Converting the <age_employment_interaction> to a numerical format using <age_employment_enc> can improve machine learning models as they tend to handle numerical data better. This could capture more granular interactions between age and employment status.

2025-09-02 15:13:30,981 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operations, with the goal of improving the downstream model's performance:

1. <duration_credit_amount_ratio><divide><duration><credit_amount><ratio_of_duration_to_credit_amount>  
   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of the duration to the credit amount might uncover the borrower's propensity to take on longer loans relative to the amount they are borrowing. A high ratio could indicate a higher risk propensity or financial instability.

2. <credit_history_property_magnitude_interaction><cross><credit_history><property_magnitude><interaction_between_credit_history_and_property>
   Reasoning: By creating an interaction between credit history and property magnitude, we can capture complex relationships that might indicate the borrower's ability or likelihood to manage credit responsibly. Property ownership combined with credit history could provide insights into creditworthiness.

3. <age_employment_and_savings_interaction><cross><age_employment_interaction><savings_status><interaction_between_age_employment_and_savings>
   Reasoning: Analyzing the interaction between age-employment interaction and savings status could reveal insights into overall financial health or stability. It's possible that certain combinations of employment duration and savings categories are more predictive of creditworthiness than others.

These steps introduce new combinations and interactions of existing features that might capture latent variables, improving model discrimination in predicting credit approval outcomes.

   Reasoning: By taking the reciprocal of the loan duration, we emphasize loans with shorter durations, which can affect the likelihood of receiving a loan. Short-term loans might correlate with different approval conditions compared to longer-term loans, potentially impacting decision-making.

2. <age_employment_dependants_ratio><ratio><age_employment_interaction><num_dependents><Ratio_of_age_and_employment_interaction_to_number_of_dependents>

   Reasoning: The interaction between age and employment can be crucial in understanding creditworthiness, especially in relation to dependents. This ratio can highlight whether younger or less experienced individuals with fewer dependents have a different likelihood of receiving credit compared to older, more experienced individuals.

3. <credit_history_property><cross><credit_history><property_magnitude><Cross_of_credit_history_and_property_to_capture_combined_financial_stability>

   Reasoning: Combining credit history with property magnitude can reveal a comprehensive view of a person's financial stability and assets. This cross-feature can capture scenarios where individuals with substantial property might have more favorable credit histories, impacting credit approval likelihood.

This feature can provide insight into the credit burden on the applicant relative to the loan period, potentially influencing the likelihood of credit approval.

2. <credit_history_sav_status_combination><cross><credit_history><savings_status><combined_credit_history_and_savings_status>  
   This feature combines credit history with savings status, providing a nuanced view of an applicant's financial behavior and stability. By considering both the history of credit payments and current savings, this feature could better predict creditworthiness.

3. <num_dependents_ratio><ratio><num_dependents><age_employment_interaction><dependents_to_age_employment_interaction_ratio>  
   The interaction between the number of dependents and age/employment status could offer insight into the financial dependability and maturity of an applicant. This feature represents how the number of dependents scales with the applicant's age and employment stability, which could impact credit decisions.

   Reasoning: Encoding the credit_history categorical variable into numerical format could help the model better understand the patterns and relationships in the data.

2. <property_purpose_cross><cross><property_magnitude><purpose><crossed_feature_of_property_and_purpose>
   Reasoning: Creating a cross feature between property_magnitude and purpose could help capture interactions between having certain types of properties and the purpose of the credit, potentially revealing patterns important for credit decisions.

3. <normalized_credit_amount><zscore><credit_amount><z_score_normalized_credit_amount>
   Reasoning: Normalizing the credit_amount using the z-score could help in reducing the skewness in its distribution. This makes it easier for the model to learn patterns involving this feature, especially when combined with others.

   Reasoning: Convert the categorical interaction between age and employment into a numerical format, enhancing its correlation strength with other numerical features in the model.

2. <checked_savings_grouped_mean><groupbythenmean><checking_savings_status><credit_amount><average_credit_amount_for_checked_savings_status>

   Reasoning: Group credit amounts by combined checking and savings status to understand the typical credit patterns within these categories, potentially identifying high-risk or high-opportunity groups.

3. <credit_history_property_encoded><cross><credit_history><property_magnitude><crossing_credit_history_with_property_status_to_explore_combined_effect_on_credit_decision>

   Reasoning: Combine credit history with property magnitude to capture unique behavioral patterns or asset backgrounds that might significantly influence credit approval decisions.
