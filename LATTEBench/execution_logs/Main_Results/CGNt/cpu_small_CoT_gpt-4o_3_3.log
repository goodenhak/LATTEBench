2025-10-15 03:54:13,468 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features, aiming to improve the prediction model's performance by exploring different transformations and interactions between features:

1. To explore the relationship between CPU-related activities and memory interactions, create a new feature representing the interaction between system read calls and writes:
   
   <sread_swrite_interaction><multiply><sread><swrite><interaction_between_system_read_and_write_calls>
   

2. Given the potential influence of memory availability on CPU performance, normalize memory-related features to understand their relative contributions more effectively:
   
   <normalized_freemem><zscore><freemem><z-score_normalization_of_freemem>
   

3. Memory read-to-write balance might be skewed; applying a logarithm can potentially stabilize the variance in this feature:
   
   <log_iowait_ratio><log><iowait_ratio><logarithm_of_iowait_ratio_to_stabilize_variance>
   

Reasoning:

1. The interaction between sread and swrite might provide insights into how the system read and write operations relate during various system loads, indicating CPU load factors.

2. Normalizing freemem helps understand its variance and potential impact relative to other features, offering insights into how memory availability could influence CPU user mode time.

3. Applying a logarithmic transformation to iowait_ratio can help manage its wide range and high variance, potentially making it a more informative feature by reducing skewness.

2025-10-15 03:54:28,374 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the downstream model's performance, we'll focus on crafting features that capture potential interactions or non-linearities in the data. Here's a detailed proposal with explanations:

1. <memory_io_ratio_log><log><iowait_ratio><logarithm_of_iowait_ratio>  
   - Reasoning: The iowait_ratio has a wide range and high variance, as indicated by a large standard deviation (std = 12507055.0827) compared to its mean of 1437120.8818. Applying a log transformation can help reduce skewness and stabilize variance, potentially making it easier for the model to learn from the data.

2. <user_mode_correlation><ratio><sread><scall><ratio_of_system_read_calls_to_system_calls>  
   - Reasoning: The sread is a subset of scall as it counts only read-type system calls. The ratio of these could indicate the proportion of system calls dedicated to reading, which might correlate with CPU usage in user mode if read operations are user-initiated tasks.

3. <memory_pressure_indicator><subtract><freemem><freeswap><difference_between_free_memory_and_free_swap>  
   - Reasoning: The difference between available memory and swap space can be an indicator of memory pressure. If freemem is significantly lower than freeswap, it could imply memory limitations forcing reliance on swap, potentially impacting CPU operation in user mode.

These features aim to capture hidden insights or trends that could contribute to better model predictions by providing alternative presentations of the underlying activity on the Sun Sparcstation.

2025-10-15 03:54:59,451 - INFO - LLM Output: To further enhance the predictive power of the model, we can generate additional features using the available operators and existing features. Here are three potential steps:

1. Feature Interaction and Complexity:
   - By interacting certain features, we may capture complex patterns. For instance, interactions involving resource allocation metrics might highlight important behavioral traits.
   - <io_memory_ratio><ratio><lread><lwrite><ratio_of_memory_reads_to_writes>

   This feature attempts to capture the balance between memory reads and writes directly, which could be indicative of specific system loads or user activities. Understanding this dynamic may provide insights into how user-mode time is impacted by memory operations.

2. Resource Pressure Indicators:
   - Memory and swap space are critical resources in a multi-user environment. Understanding their relationship can point toward system strain.
   - <swap_memory_pressure_ratio><ratio><freeswap><freemem><ratio_of_free_swap_to_free_memory>

   By considering the ratio between free swap space and free memory, this feature aims to capture the degree of reliance on swap space over the in-memory resources. A higher ratio might suggest more intense usage conditions affecting user-mode activities.

3. System Call Efficiency:
   - Efficiency in handling system calls, as reflected by the number of system read calls to system calls, could be pivotal for system performance.
   - <system_calls_efficiency><ratio><scall><fork><system_calls_to_fork_ratio>

   Calculating the ratio of total system calls made per fork call may offer insights into process efficiency. High efficiency might yield more time in user-mode due to lesser time in system operations, aiding in performance bottleneck identification.

   Multiplying the rate of system calls (scall) with the number of system fork calls (fork) gives an indication of CPU intensity and task-switching activity, which could relate to the CPU operating in user mode. The number of forks is a classic indicator of new processes being created, which combined with system calls might be influencing CPU user mode.

3. <normalized_memory_pressure><zscore><memory_pressure_indicator><z_score_normalization_of_memory_pressure>  
   Normalizing memory_pressure_indicator using z-score might highlight instances where high or low memory pressure correlates with variations in the CPU running in user mode. This transformation will scale the values based on deviation from the mean, and could help with models sensitive to scale variations in inputs.

2025-10-15 03:55:31,408 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we can generate new features using the available operations. Here are three suggestions, each with reasoning behind the steps:

### Feature Engineering Suggestions

1. Weighted IO Operations Feature:
   - Reasoning: Both sread and swrite provide information on system read and write operations. By weighing these by their respective rchar and wchar, we can get a more nuanced view of the system's data throughput and its correlation with CPU usage.
   - <weighted_io_operations><multiply><sread><rchar><weighted_view_of_system_read_operations>
   - <weighted_io_operations><multiply><swrite><wchar><weighted_view_of_system_write_operations>

2. Memory Pressure Intensity:
   - Reasoning: The difference between free memory and free swap, captured by memory_pressure_indicator, provides information on memory availability. By applying a logarithmic transformation, we might capture exponential patterns in memory pressure more effectively, which could influence CPU usage.
   - <log_memory_pressure_intensity><log><memory_pressure_indicator><log_view_of_memory_pressure_intensity>

3. CPU Queue and Memory Interaction:
   - Reasoning: The interaction between queue size (runqsz) and memory pressure might indicate system load conditions affecting CPU usage. Creating a ratio helps in evaluating how run queue size corresponds to available memory resources.
   - <queue_memory_interaction_ratio><ratio><runqsz><freemem><interaction_of_queue_size_with_free_memory>

These features aim to capture different aspects of system operations, such as IO-weighed operations, exponential memory pressure representation, and queue-memory dynamics, potentially improving the prediction of user mode CPU portion.

2025-10-15 03:55:57,039 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the given dataset and task, we want to improve predictions related to CPU utilization by creating new features that better capture the relationships and interactions between existing features. Here are three proposed steps for feature generation:

1. <memory_pressure_ratio><ratio><freemem><freeswap><ratio_of_free_memory_to_free_swap>  
   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio between free memory and free swap can help understand how memory is being used with respect to available swap space. This can be an indicator of how balanced memory resources are, influencing CPU usage indirectly.

2. <cpu_usage_intensity><multiply><scall><exec><intensity_of_cpu_usage_based_on_system_calls_and_execs>  
   - Reasoning: Multiplying the number of system calls with exec calls might give an estimate of CPU utilization relative to how much of its resources are being used to manage executions. This can be strongly related to user mode CPU running time.

3. <memory_cpu_interaction><divide><runqsz><average_of_memory_and_cpu_interaction><dividing_run_queue_size_by_sum_of_memory_and_user_mode_interaction>  
   - Reasoning: This feature attempts to understand the interaction between process run queue size and key features related to memory and user mode interaction. Dividing run queue size by a composite measure of these elements can reflect how CPU queues interact with memory, potentially impacting user mode utilization.

These steps aim to create features that highlight key relationships and interactions that may impact CPU usage in user mode. By considering both memory utilization and CPU activity, these features can provide a deeper understanding of how system resources are being utilized and enhance prediction accuracy.

2025-10-15 03:56:26,405 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the dataset and the current top new features, we can proceed with creating additional features that could potentially improve the prediction of the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode. Below are three possible next steps for feature engineering:

1. <cpu_memory_pressure_interaction><multiply><cpu_usage_intensity><normalized_memory_pressure><interaction_between_cpu_usage_and_memory_pressure>
   - Reasoning: Combining cpu_usage_intensity with normalized_memory_pressure could capture the interaction between CPU load and memory pressure, which might affect the CPU's efficiency in handling user-mode operations.

2. <io_balance_adjusted><ratio><weighted_io_operations><iowait_ratio><io_balance_indicating_efficient_io_usage>
   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio of weighted_io_operations to iowait_ratio could provide insights into the balance of input/output operations, shedding light on how efficiently I/O is handled, which might impact CPU user-mode time.

3. <memory_usage_intensity><multiply><log_memory_pressure_intensity><user_mode_correlation><effect_of_memory_pressure_intensity_on_user_mode>
   - Reasoning: Multiplying log_memory_pressure_intensity with user_mode_correlation can reveal insights into how memory pressure and its intensity influence the CPU's time running in user mode, as increased memory pressure can divert CPU usage to system operations.

2025-10-15 03:56:57,105 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's focus on generating features that can capture interactions and meaningful transformations of the existing features, potentially improving the downstream model's performance in predicting CPU usage in user mode.

1. Feature 1: Interaction between CPU intensity and user mode correlation to gauge how CPU usage correlates with system read calls.
   - <cpu_user_mode_interaction><multiply><cpu_intensity_indicator><user_mode_correlation><interaction_between_cpu_intensity_and_user_mode_correlation>

   *Reasoning*: This feature attempts to capture whether higher CPU intensity correlates with more system calls occurring in user mode, potentially indicating user-driven processes.

2. Feature 2: Ratio of available free memory to CPU usage intensity.
   - <memory_to_cpu_intensity_ratio><ratio><freemem><cpu_usage_intensity><ratio_of_free_memory_to_cpu_usage_intensity>

   *Reasoning*: This feature evaluates if the amount of free memory could impact the intensity of CPU usage, hinting towards memory-bottlenecked processes that may affect CPU performance.

3. Feature 3: Weighted combination of IO balance adjusted by the weighted view of system read operations.
   - <weighted_io_efficiency><multiply><io_balance_adjusted><weighted_io_operations><product_of_io_balance_and_weighted_read_operations>

   *Reasoning*: A high value could indicate efficient IO usage, which might relate to more CPU resources being available for user operations. It combines balance with actual operational load for a nuanced view.

These features leverage both existing features and normalized transformations to potentially provide additional insights into the relationship between system activities and CPU usage in user mode.
