2025-10-15 03:44:43,284 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the provided operations to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <mem_io_ratio><divide><lread><freemem><Ratio_of_memory_reads_to_free_memory>
   - Reasoning: This feature could capture the relationship between memory read operations and the available memory, which might be significant if higher memory usage impacts CPU usage patterns, especially if memory reads are related to CPU-bound tasks.

2. <syscall_efficiency><divide><scall><runqsz><System_calls_per_unit_of_run_queue_size>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures how efficiently system calls are being processed relative to the size of the run queue. If CPUs running in user mode are affected by how efficiently system calls are handled, this feature might help in capturing such dynamics.

3. <io_throughput><plus><rchar><wchar><Combined_IO_throughput>
   - Reasoning: Total IO throughput might affect CPU efficiency and workload distribution. Combining read and write character counts gives a measure of total data transfer that could correlate with CPU usage in user mode tasks, offering an aggregate view of IO activity which can influence user mode processing.

2025-10-15 03:45:13,583 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the given operations, with the goal of improving the downstream model's performance:

1. <io_efficiency><divide><io_operations><io_throughput><Efficiency_of_IO_operations>  
   Reasoning: By calculating the efficiency of IO operations as the ratio of total local IO operations to combined IO throughput, we can gain insight into how effectively the system is handling IO operations relative to its throughput. This can be a significant feature for predicting CPU time in user mode, especially in a multi-user environment where IO efficiency might impact overall performance.

2. <memory_pressure><subtract><freemem><lread><Effective_memory_pressure>
   Reasoning: By subtracting memory reads from available free memory, this feature captures the net memory pressure on the system. High memory pressure due to low free memory and high memory reads can lead to increased CPU utilization time as processes compete for limited resources, affecting CPU time in user mode.

3. <system_call_ratio><divide><swrite><sread><Write_to_read_system_call_ratio>
   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of system write calls to system read calls provides a more nuanced view of the balance between write and read operations at the system call level. This feature can highlight potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in how system calls are being utilized, impacting CPU performance and consequently its time spent in user mode.

   - Reasoning: By investigating the balance between memory reads and writes, we may uncover how memory operations influence CPU usage in user mode. Since the existing top features include a memory-to-freemem ratio, this feature could serve as a complementary insight into the efficiency of memory usage.

2. <cpu_intensity><multiply><scall><exec><System_call_exec_interaction_intensity>
   - Reasoning: The combination of system calls and exec operations may highlight periods of intense CPU activity, which might relate to the CPU running in user mode more frequently. System calls and execs are highly relevant in determining user mode tasks, as they often accompany CPU-bound operations.

3. <io_efficiency><divide><io_throughput><performance_factor><Efficiency_of_IO_operations_relative_to_system_performance>
   - Reasoning: This feature intends to provide insights on how efficiently the system performs IO operations relative to its overall performance. This could indicate whether higher throughput corresponds with optimal CPU usage in user mode, evaluating the balance between throughput and overall efficiency as captured by performance factor.

2025-10-15 03:45:46,909 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps to potentially improve the model's performance:

1. \<normalized_freemem\>\<zscore\>\<freemem\>\<Normalized_memory_pages_available_to_user_processes\>
   - Reasoning: The feature freemem represents the number of memory pages available to user processes. By normalizing this feature using the z-score, we can reduce the effect of skewness and make it more comparable across different instances. This could help the model identify patterns related to memory availability more effectively.

2. \<io_efficiency_ratio\>\<divide\>\<io_operations\>\<lread\>\<Efficiency_of_IO_operations_per_memory_read\>
   - Reasoning: The io_operations feature represents the total local I/O operations, while lread is the number of reads between system and user memory. Creating a ratio of I/O operations to memory reads can provide insight into how efficiently I/O operations are being performed relative to memory reads, which might correlate with CPU usage.

3. \<interaction_factor\>\<multiply\>\<syscall_efficiency\>\<io_throughput\>\<Interaction_between_syscall_efficiency_and_io_throughput\>
   - Reasoning: By multiplying syscall_efficiency and io_throughput, we can create a feature that represents the interaction between system call efficiency and the combined I/O throughput. This interaction could highlight scenarios where high throughput combines with efficient system calls, potentially indicating higher CPU utilization for certain tasks.

2025-10-15 03:46:26,528 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To enhance the model's predictive capabilities when estimating the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode, we will aim to create innovative features that can capture the complex interactions and distributions within the data. Below are three potential feature engineering steps using the operations provided:

1. Consider memory and IO efficiency:
   - <mem_io_effectiveness><multiply><mem_io_ratio><io_operations><Interaction_between_memory_IO_ratio_and_operations>
     - Reasoning: This feature combines the efficacy of memory read efficiency (mem_io_ratio) with the total IO operations. High mem_io_ratio values along with low io_operations could indicate potential system bottlenecks, potentially affecting CPU time spent in user mode.

2. Contrast system calls and process queue size:
   - <system_load_contrast><subtract><scall><runqsz><Difference_between_system_calls_and_run_queue_size>
     - Reasoning: This feature investigates the difference between the number of system calls and the process run queue size. A large discrepancy, especially with a high number of calls but a small queue size, could imply a busy system not overwhelmed by too many queued processes, possibly correlating with user mode processing time.

3. Explore free resources influence:
   - <free_resources_allocative_pressure><divide><freemem><freeswap><Relative_ratio_of_free_memory_to_free_swap>
     - Reasoning: This feature looks at the relative availability of free memory to free swap space, indicating the pressure on memory resources. If free memory is low while swap space remains high, it may infer a memory-bound system which could impact CPU usage patterns.

By generating and analyzing these new features within a computational model, we aim to enhance the precision of predictions regarding user mode CPU utilization by better capturing the underlying system performance dynamics.

2025-10-15 03:47:02,252 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for the portion of time CPUs run in user mode, we'll explore new feature combinations using existing features, applying transformations that could potentially reveal underlying patterns or relationships. Here are three possible next steps:

1. Address Memory versus IO Balance:
   - <memory_io_balance><divide><rchar><freemem><Ratio_of_characters_read_to_free_memory>: This feature measures how intensive the character read operations are relative to the available free memory. If the system is doing a lot of read operations while memory is low, this might indicate high user-mode activity, as processes are likely being read from disk into memory.

2. Explore CPU-bound Operation Indicators:
   - <cpu_operation_intensity><multiply><exec><fork><Combined_CPU_operation_intensity>: This feature multiplies the number of system exec calls with fork calls, which might indicate how much CPU time is being spent on operations that lead to new processes being created and executed. High values could correspond to more user-mode processing.

3. Understand IO versus System Call Efficiency:
   - <io_to_syscall_efficiency><subtract><syscall_efficiency><io_operations><Difference_between_IO_operations_and_syscall_efficiency>: This feature subtracts the number of IO operations from the syscall efficiency metric. It aims to reveal whether high syscall efficiency is due to IO operations, potentially impacting CPU usage patterns in user mode.

By generating these features, the model could uncover nuanced interactions between system performance metrics and resource usage, enhancing prediction accuracy for the proportion of time CPUs run in user mode.
