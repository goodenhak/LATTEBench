   Reasoning: By combining the credit amount and installment commitment, this feature aims to capture the total liability of the individual, which can provide insights into their financial commitment and help determine their creditworthiness.

2. <risk_ratio><divide><credit_amount_duration_ratio><residence_since><borrowing_level_relative_to_residence_duration>  
   Reasoning: This feature assesses the borrowing level in relation to how long the individual has resided at their current place. Longer residence might imply stability, and the ratio could help understand if high borrowing amounts are justified given their residential stability.

3. <property_housing_interaction><cross><property_magnitude><housing><interaction_between_property_and_housing_to_identify_asset_security>  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between property ownership and housing status to evaluate the level of asset-backed security. For example, owning real estate and owning your house may indicate stronger asset security compared to renting and having no known property.

   Reasoning: Employment and savings status can both indicate a person's financial stability. Combining these features might reveal patterns that better indicate the risk level or creditworthiness of an individual.

2. \<credit_per_year\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<residence_since\>\<average_credit_amount_per_year_of_residence_to_assess_credit_usage_over_time\>

   Reasoning: Calculating the average credit amount per year of residence might give insights into how frequently and reliably an individual can handle credit over time, factoring in their stability at a location.

3. \<duration_savings_ratio\>\<divide\>\<duration\>\<savings_status\>\<ratio_of_loan_duration_to_savings_status\>

   Reasoning: By analyzing the loan duration in relation to their savings status, we might uncover how savings buffer duration impacts an individual's credit profile. Converting savings status into a numerical form, such as using ordinal labels, would be necessary here.

   - Reasoning: Understanding how employment status relates to housing status could provide insights into a person's financial stability and their likelihood of receiving credit. Encoding housing to a numerical form can help measure this.

2. <purpose_installment_cross><cross><purpose><installment_commitment><interaction_of_purpose_of_credit_and_installment_rate_to_evaluate_affordability>
   - Reasoning: Crossing purpose with installment_commitment can reveal which purposes are typically associated with high or low installment rates, potentially indicating riskier loans. This could help in assessing credit-worthiness based on purpose.

3. <savings_checking_cross><cross><savings_status><checking_status><interaction_of_savings_and_checking_status_to_evaluate_financial_liquidity>
   - Reasoning: Incorporating both savings_status and checking_status can give a more comprehensive view of a person's available cash flow. This might indicate financial prudence and predictability in managing credit.

   - Reasoning: Understanding how much credit amount one holds relative to their residence duration could provide insights into a person’s stability and long-term credit reliability. People with higher ratios may be less reliable for credit.

2. <savings_employment_cross><cross><savings_status><employment><interaction_of_savings_and_employment_to_capture_financial_standing>
   - Reasoning: By crossing savings status with employment categories, we aim to capture a nuanced view of financial liquidity and stability. This can provide valuable insight into a person’s reliability in managing credit.

3. <duration_savings_mod><mod><duration><savings_status><evaluating_duration_wrt_savings_status_to_anticipate_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Using the modulo operation, we can evaluate how the duration of credit interacts with different savings status categories. This might reveal specific patterns between shorter/longer credit durations and savings capabilities, influencing credit decisions.

   - Reasoning: Combining the credit amount duration ratio with duration itself may uncover nonlinear patterns of extended borrowing behaviors that affect credit approval probability.

2. \<housing_employment_interaction\><cross><housing><employment_label>\<interaction_of_housing_and_employment_to_captivate_stability_and_risk\>  
   - Reasoning: Cross the housing status with the employment label to capture the combined effect of housing stability and employment status, which might influence credit approval.

3. \<savings_instalment_ratio\><divide><installment_commitment><savings_status>\<understanding_installment_commitment_relative_to_savings_status\>  
   - Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of installment commitment to savings gives an idea about the financial strain and flexibility which may provide insights into the applicant's creditworthiness.

   Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_ratio has a large range and standard deviation, indicating possible outliers. Applying a z-score standardization may reduce the effect of these outliers and yield more consistent predictions related to borrowing levels across different scenarios.

2. <personal_socioeconomic_binary><bin><personal_housing_cross><binary_representation_of_personal_status_and_housing_interaction_for_socioeconomic_analytics>
   
   Reasoning: Bin the personal_housing_cross categorical interaction feature to simplify the interpretation of socio-economic status. This reduction can help the model focus on broader trends, potentially improving its ability to generalize outcomes concerning personal finances and housing.

3. <credit_amount_residence_interaction><ratio><credit_over_residence_ratio><residence_since><interaction_of_credit_amount_residence_ratio_with_duration_of_residence_to_gather_insights_on_stability>
   
   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of credit_over_residence_ratio to residence_since captures stability in credit patterns relative to the length of residence. This feature might reveal additional structural relationships between people's credit behavior and their residential stability, enhancing prediction accuracy.
