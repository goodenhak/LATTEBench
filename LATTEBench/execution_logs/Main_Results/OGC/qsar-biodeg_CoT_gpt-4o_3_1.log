1. Polarizability_Index: By combining polarizability and electronegativity metrics, this index aims to examine how molecular interactions might change the biodegradation pathways.
   
2. Cyclic_Complexity: This new metric uses insights from ring complexity in association with carbon concentration, providing an overview of structural complexity within the molecule.
   
3. Functionality_Density: This takes into account the density of groups in relation to stability, factoring in highly reactive functional components which provide key insights into biodegradation pathways.
   
4. Zscore_Normalized_C_L: Utilizing z-score normalization allows for understanding the spread of spectral data, aligning with stability metrics to better infer biodegradation.
   
5. Total_Connectivity: By integrating pseudoconnectivity indices, this feature inspects molecule-wide interactions that potentially affect environmental breakdown mechanisms.
   
6. Atomic_Variability: This feature captures atom-level variability across subsets within the dataset, which can facilitate revealing molecular features linked to biodegradability.

These features aim to capture novel interactions and systemic complexities that could provide additional insight into the biodegradation classification task. Each feature is designed to explore different biochemical properties, without relying on similar constructs from the previous attempt.

Here are some new feature ideas:

1. Logarithm Transformation of Highly Skewed Features
   - Some features might benefit from log transformation due to their skewed distributions.

2. Polynomial Interaction Terms
   - We can explore polynomial interactions between pairs of molecular descriptors that might capture complex relationships.

3. Normalized Indices Based on Selected Features
   - Index based on the most extreme descriptors to help identify unique molecular characteristics that influence biodegradability.

Let's define these new features:

python

# Logarithm transformation of the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix.
# Usefulness: Mitigate skewness in distribution for improved model performance.
df['log_SpMax_L'] = np.log1p(df['SpMax_L'])

# log_J_Dz
# Logarithm transformation of J_Dz(e) to manage skewness.
# Usefulness: Provides a more normalized input for models affected by input distribution.
df['log_J_Dz'] = np.log1p(df['J_Dz(e)'])

# nitrogen_oxygen_interaction
# Polynomial interaction between nN and nO to see combined effects on biodegradability.
# Usefulness: Molecular descriptors related to N and O have strong influences on biodegradability due to their polar nature.
df['nitrogen_oxygen_interaction'] = df['nN'] * df['nO']

df['Carbon_Percent_Reflectance'] = df['C%'] / (df['nO'] + df['nN'] + 1e-5)

python
df.drop(columns=['Electronegativity_Connectivity_Ratio',

Here's a new set of feature engineering strategies:

### Key Considerations:

1. Transformations: Introduce sine transformations to capture non-linear relationships that might be present in the molecular interactions.
2. Combining Features: Created hybrid/mixed features leveraging connectivity and complexity measures which could provide a different perspective on biodegradability.
3. Remove Less Useful Features: Removed potentially less impactful features thus reducing noise in the dataset.

Execute this set of strategies on your dataset and evaluate whether it improves the validation score. This approach aims to bring out unique combinations and transformations that may better capture the underlying patterns for the biodegradability classification task.

3. SpMax_Normalized_Variability: Analyzing the variation in eigenvalues from different matrices can elucidate discrepancies in molecular topology, potentially affecting the ease or difficulty of decomposition.

4. Hydrophobicity_Index: Hydrophobic compounds tend to have distinct molecular interactions affecting their solubility and by extension, their biodegradability. Linking hydrophobic properties to structural features helps provide insights into the likelihood of degradation.

5. Mean_Electronegativity_Ratio: By comparing different measures of electronegativity, this index provides a nuanced view of potential reactivity spikes, aiding in predicting how a molecule might interact with its surroundings.

6. Complex_Molecular_Interaction: These interactions highlight components of molecular complexity that may disclose avenues or barriers to degradation, thus supporting prediction models regarding biotic processes.

7. Sine_Structural_Complexity: Non-linear transformations like sine are beneficial in capturing hidden patterns that straightforward linear interactions won't reveal.

8. Drop redundant features: Dropping nArNO2 and nCRX3 is proposed because they convey minimal variance or overlap with other features affecting the meaningfulness of the constructed model.

python
df.drop(columns=['F01[N-N]', 'B04[C-Br]', 'nN-N', 'N-073', 'B01[C-Br]'], inplace=True)
end

By focusing on ratios, log transformations, and normalized values, we aim to capture underlying chemical dynamics that are crucial to predicting degradability more accurately. Let's validate the improvement in prediction accuracy with these added features and adjustments.

2026-01-27 18:50:04,162 - INFO - Turn 9 LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the validation score further, I'll create a new set of features based on different transformations and combinations of existing features. I'll interpret the dataset characteristics to extract relevant patterns or interactions that could lead to more accurate predictions of biodegradability.

Let's generate some alternative feature engineering ideas:

python
# Feature name
Enriched_Oxygen_Interaction_Index

# Feature description
Enhanced interaction potential by multiplying the Oxygen_Richness_Index with Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction.

# Usefulness:
Combining oxygen richness with the interaction factor creates a focus on oxygen-driven reactions with other elements, which is critical in understanding biodegradability pathways because oxygen is often a reactive site.

# Calculation
df['Enriched_Oxygen_Interaction_Index'] = df['Oxygen_Richness_Index'] * df['Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction']
end

python
# Feature name
Log_Connectivity_Difference

# Feature description
Logarithmic scale of the absolute difference between connectivity-driven indices.

# Usefulness:
Measure the deviation in connectivity pathways that could align with unique degradation behaviors across molecular structures. Large differences in connectivity can signal alternative reaction points.

# Calculation
df['Log_Connectivity_Difference'] = (df['Connectivity_Reactivity_Index'] - df['Electronegativity_Connectivity_Ratio']).apply(lambda x: np.log(abs(x) + 1))
end

python
# Feature name
Ionization_Bond_Weighted_Ratio

# Feature description
Weighted ratio of Ionization_HeavyAtom_Ratio by Carbon_Oxygen_Hydrogen_Bond_Ratio.

# Usefulness:
Provides insight into the influence of ionization levels on bonding characteristics, which are relevant in breaking chemical bonds during biodegradation.

# Calculation
df['Ionization_Bond_Weighted_Ratio'] = df['Ionization_HeavyAtom_Ratio'] * df['Carbon_Oxygen_Hydrogen_Bond_Ratio']
end

python
# Feature name
Normalized_Hydrophobicity_Ratio

# Feature description
Ratio of hydrophobicity to the sum of all mean electronegativity ratios, normalized to enhance interpretation.

# Usefulness:
Emphasizes how hydrophobic characteristics may counteract electronegativity influence, which can be critical in understanding compound interactions with surrounding environments.

# Calculation
df['Normalized_Hydrophobicity_Ratio'] = (df['Hydrophobicity_Index'] / (df['Mean_Electronegativity_Ratio'] + 1))
df['Normalized_Hydrophobicity_Ratio'] = (df['Normalized_Hydrophobicity_Ratio'] - df['Normalized_Hydrophobicity_Ratio'].mean()) / df['Normalized_Hydrophobicity_Ratio'].std()
end

python
# Feature name
Complexity_Connectivity_Coefficient

# Feature description
Coefficient derived from the ratio and difference of structural complexity and connectivity-reactivity index.

# Usefulness:
Aims to uncover novel patterns by integrating complexity and connectivity into a single coefficient, capturing nuanced interactions that are relevant to decomposition and biodegradability.

# Calculation
df['Complexity_Connectivity_Coefficient'] = (df['Structural_Complexity_Index'] / (df['Connectivity_Reactivity_Index'] + 1)) - df['SpMax_L']
end

python
df.drop(columns=['nArCOOR', 'nCIR', 'B01[C-Br]', 'N-073', 'nN-N'], inplace=True)
end

The above transformations and combinations aim to extract different elemental interactions and patterns that are not only linked to oxygen or carbon, but also consider engagement with other key molecular structures for a holistic evaluation of biodegradability potential. Let's try these ideas and see if they improve the validation score.

Explanation:

1. Reactive_Site_Impact: By multiplying intrinsic pseudoconnectivity (Psi_i_A) with the sum of electronegative states (SdO), we derive a feature that highlights potential reactive impact areas, enhancing biodegradability insights similarly to Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction.

2. Structural_Reactivity_Inverse: The reciprocal of Structural_Complexity_Index serves to highlight the inverse relation of complexity with biodegradability potential.

3. Oxygen_Nitrogen_Balance_Index: This feature emphasizes the oxygen-to-nitrogen balance, essential for characterizing reactive interactions in molecules that affect decomposition.

4. Mean_Energy_Spectrum: By averaging leading eigenvalue characteristics from Laplace and Burden matrices, we gather insights into energy stabilization related to biodegradability.

5. Electronegativity_Centering: This difference between mean atomic electronegativity and ionization highlights central tendencies in reactive potentials. 

By dropping features with potential redundancy or high variance, we aim to reduce noise in the model. The new engineered features should capture nuanced relationships facilitating analytics for better biodegradability classification.

2026-01-27 18:53:04,474 - INFO - Turn 10 LLM Output: Based on the task and previous feature generation attempts, we will explore new combinations and transformations of the existing features with the goal of improving prediction accuracy. Below, I propose several new features and modifications:

python
# Biodegradable_Predictor_Index
# Ratio of Psi_i_A to Mi, reflecting how intrinsic molecular state and ionization potential interplay in biodegradability.
# Usefulness: Captures a critical transition period molecular descriptors undergo to influence biodegradability readiness.
df['Biodegradable_Predictor_Index'] = df['Psi_i_A'] / df['Mi']

# Smart_Oxygen_Nitrogen_Interaction
# Interaction between Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction and nO adjusted by nN reflecting reactivity hotspots.
# Usefulness: Integrates the potential oxidizing and reactive capacity of molecules due to oxygen and nitrogen presence.
df['Smart_Oxygen_Nitrogen_Interaction'] = df['Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction'] * (df['nO'] / (df['nN'] + 1))

# Stability_Effectiveness_Ratio
# Stability measure from SM6_L divided by Reciprocal_Molecular_Size, evaluating how molecular size impacts stability.
# Usefulness: Targets how larger molecules' arrangements support biodegradation readiness, capturing molecular distribution effects.
df['Stability_Effectiveness_Ratio'] = df['SM6_L'] / df['Reciprocal_Molecular_Size']

# Integrated_Bond_Stability_Log
# Log transformation of Carbon_Oxygen_Hydrogen_Bond_Ratio multiplied by SpMax_B(m), considering bond oscillation effects.
# Usefulness: Evaluates stability and resonance of bonds in network structures, which are pivotal for biodegradation simulation.
df['Integrated_Bond_Stability_Log'] = np.log1p(df['Carbon_Oxygen_Hydrogen_Bond_Ratio'] * df['SpMax_B(m)'])

# Enhanced_Spectral_Diversity
# Difference between SpMax_L and SM6_L added to Logarithmic_Complexity_Normalization.
# Usefulness: Analyzes spectral diversity and related complexities, critical for modeling unpredictable chemical interactions.
df['Enhanced_Spectral_Diversity'] = (df['SpMax_L'] - df['SM6_L']) + df['Logarithmic_Complexity_Normalization']

df.drop(columns=['Ionization_HeavyAtom_Ratio', 'F01[N-N]', 'Mean_Electronegativity_Ratio'], inplace=True)
end

Explanation of dropped columns:
- Ionization_HeavyAtom_Ratio: This ratio may introduce irrelevant correlation noise within the interaction.
- F01[N-N]: Its infrequent occurrences in the dataset mean it might add little informative value in biodegradability prediction.
- Mean_Electronegativity_Ratio: The structure of naturally overlapping interactions might contribute less due to high common values around the mean, offering limited discrimination between classes.

These transformations and feature interactions aim to better capture underlying molecular processes influencing biodegradability, while removing potentially redundant or non-informative features.

### Explanation
- Square root transformation (F03[C-O]) allows focusing on mid to low frequency values by reducing the influence of extreme high values.
- Reciprocal transformation (nHDon_nO_ratio) highlights the inverse relationship of these ratios which could be crucial due to low counts of hydrogen bond donors.
- Log transformation (SdO) manages large value skews and enhances smaller, more detailed variance.
- Normalization (Structural_Complexity_Index by C%) constructs a weighted comparison between structural complexity and carbon content, tailoring complexity to molecular size.
- Ionization potential relevance to hydrophobicity suggests meaningful interaction insights by comparing ionization potential to hydrophobic properties on a log scale.
- Feature dropping gets rid of potentially redundant features or those now captured by simpler transformations, minimizing input dimensionality and noise.

We should apply these new features and transformations, run validation, and examine the score improvement to assess their utility.

3. log_Carbon_Oxygen_Hydrogen_ratio: Log transformations capture multiplicative effects and manage skewness, especially with ratios that may present extreme values due to molecular composition variances.

4. combined_SP_Hybrid_LogInteraction: Combining Sphere Packing Efficiency with Hybrid Interaction Index in a log-transformed feature could improve the understanding of how these molecular packing and interaction properties relate to biodegradability.

5. max_Electronegativity_Structural_Complexity: Comparing and taking the maximum reflects which aspect has higher influence on the molecule, crucial for determining biodegradability potential between electronegativity and structural complexity.

2026-01-27 18:55:47,780 - INFO - Turn 9 LLM Output: To enhance the prediction accuracy, let's attempt a fresh round of feature engineering. We can explore different combinations and transformations of existing features:

python
# Energy_Distribution_Index
# Combines Interaction_Log and the square root of SM6_L to assess how energy distribution affects biodegradability.
# Usefulness: Molecules with certain energy distribution patterns might be more prone to interaction and degradation.
df['Energy_Distribution_Index'] = df['Interaction_Log'] * np.sqrt(df['SM6_L'])

# Reactive_Site_Intensity
# Squares Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction and multiplies by Mean_Electronegativity_Ratio to evaluate the intensity at reactive sites.
# Usefulness: High intensity at reactive molecular sites can indicate spots where biodegradation might commence.
df['Reactive_Site_Intensity'] = np.power(df['Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction'], 2) * df['Mean_Electronegativity_Ratio']

# Connectivity_Structure_Balance
# Division of Electronegativity_Connectivity_Ratio by SpMax_Normalized_Variability to balance connectivity and structural complexity.
# Usefulness: A balanced connectivity structure might be associated with resilience or susceptibility to biodegradation.
df['Connectivity_Structure_Balance'] = df['Electronegativity_Connectivity_Ratio'] / (1 + df['SpMax_Normalized_Variability'])

# Structural_Reactivity_Index
# Product of Psi_i_A and Carbon_Oxygen_Hydrogen_Bond_Ratio to highlight structural components related to reactive potential.
# Usefulness: Reactivity linked to structural components aligns with potential pathways of biodegradation.
df['Structural_Reactivity_Index'] = df['Psi_i_A'] * df['Carbon_Oxygen_Hydrogen_Bond_Ratio']

# Hydrophobic_Interaction_Coefficient
# Multiplies Hydrophobicity_Index by Interaction_Log to examine the coefficient related to the interaction of hydrophobic molecules.
# Usefulness: Hydrophobic interactions play a significant role in biodegradation, especially in aqueous environments.
df['Hydrophobic_Interaction_Coefficient'] = df['Hydrophobicity_Index'] * df['Interaction_Log']

# Logarithmic_Reactivity_Potential
# Log transformation of F03[C-O] multiplied by SM6_L to emphasize reactivity potential hidden within molecular structure.
# Usefulness: Helps capture the logarithmic scale of reactivity potential contributing to biodegradation initiation.
df['Logarithmic_Reactivity_Potential'] = np.log1p(df['F03[C-O]']) * df['SM6_L']

# Oxygen_Density_Influence
# Ratio of Oxygen_Richness_Index to Sphere_Packing_Efficiency to evaluate the influence of oxygen density on molecular packing.
# Usefulness: High oxygen density impacts molecular structure, potentially altering the degradation mechanism.
df['Oxygen_Density_Influence'] = df['Oxygen_Richness_Index'] / (1 + df['Sphere_Packing_Efficiency'])
end

Finally, remove features that may not have contributed effectively to the predictive accuracy:

python
df.drop(columns=['SpMax_B_m_Reciprocal', 
                 'Reciprocal_Hybrid_Interaction_Index', 
                 'SM6_L_Logarithmic_Complexity_Normalization_interact'], inplace=True)
end

This approach aims to shift the feature combinations to emphasize molecular characteristics that might be more closely linked to biodegradation, potentially uncovering novel insights through these transformations.

### Feature Creation
python
# Interactivity_Index
# Combines multiple interaction-based attributes to capture holistic molecular activity.
# Usefulness: By aggregating interactions, this feature could identify compounds with potentially unique reactive behaviors.
df['Interactivity_Index'] = df['Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction'] + df['Hybrid_Interaction_Index'] + df['Adjusted_Bond_Affinities']

# Carbon_Bond_Effectiveness
# Evaluates the ratio of carbon-related bond interactions with intrinsic atom properties.
# Usefulness: Balances structure and electronegativity impacts, potentially revealing effective carbon bonds in biodegradation.
df['Carbon_Bond_Effectiveness'] = df['Carbon_Oxygen_Hydrogen_Bond_Ratio'] / (df['Me'] + df['Mi'])

# Oxygen_Nitrogen_Ratio
# Computes the ratio between the number of oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
# Usefulness: Provides insights on compounds richer in oxygen versus nitrogen, relevant for biodegradation metrics.
df['Oxygen_Nitrogen_Ratio'] = df['nO'] / (df['nN'] + 1)  # Adding 1 to avoid division by zero

# Normalized_Electronegativity_Effect
# Evaluates electronegativity combined without range influence, normalizing for direct impact.
# Usefulness: This offers a standard measure of electronegativity effects which could forecast biodegradability.
df['Normalized_Electronegativity_Effect'] = df['Electronegativity_Connectivity_Ratio'] / df['Mean_Electronegativity_Ratio']

# Psi_SM6_Interaction
# Evaluates the potential interactions between molecular connectivity and structural complexity.
# Usefulness: Connectivity and structure interactions may uncover potential areas of the molecule predisposed to breakdown.
df['Psi_SM6_Interaction'] = np.cos(df['Psi_i_A'] * df['SM6_L'])
end

### Dropping Unnecessary Columns
python
df.drop(columns=['F01[N-N]', 'B04[C-Br]', 'C-026', 'Adjusted_Bond_Affinities'], inplace=True)
# Removing columns with minimal variability or low potential to differentiate between chemical classes.
# Usefulness: Specifies which attributes contribute less to classification efficacy, thus optimizing model performance. 
end

### Adjustments and Transformations
python
# Log_Transform_Hybrid_Index
# Applies a logarithmic transformation to reduce skewness.
# Usefulness: Reducing skew and capturing relative differences, refining model input data distribution for better predictions.
df['Log_Transform_Hybrid_Index'] = np.log1p(df['Hybrid_Interaction_Index'])

# Ratio_Sphere_Packing_Efficiency
# Adjusts for size differences using ratio transformations.
# Usefulness: Captures packing variations in molecules that may influence biodegradability.
df['Ratio_Sphere_Packing_Efficiency'] = df['Sphere_Packing_Efficiency'] / df['SpMax_Normalized_Variability']
end

These features leverage molecular connectivity, composition interaction, and compound structure, helping bolster the predictive model's performance with real-world biodegradation insights. By adjusting ratios and employing logarithmic transformations, the dataset's skewness is reduced, and compound structural attributes are better integrated into the model narrative.

2026-01-27 18:56:39,284 - INFO - Turn 5 LLM Output: Based on the dataset's detailed attributes and the goal of distinguishing between ready and not ready biodegradable chemicals, we can identify potential interactions and transformations that might reveal more complex patterns within the features. Here are some ideas for feature generation that could improve the validation score:

1. Feature interaction using multiplication: Considering interactions between features can highlight synergies or conflicts in chemical properties that affect biodegradability.

2. Logarithmic transformation: Especially useful for features with a wide range or skewed distribution, to stabilize variance and normalize distributions.

3. Ratios and differences: Creating ratios or differences from chemically meaningful attributes can reveal relative strengths of molecular properties.

4. Cosine and sine transformations of angles: These can capture periodic trends or cyclic nature in some molecular configurations.

5. Exponential transformations: To accentuate the effect of certain low-magnitude features on the prediction.

Let's implement these transformations:

python
# Interaction_Combined
# Combines Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction and SM6_L to evaluate complex molecular interactions.
# Usefulness: This operation might highlight significant interactions which contribute to chemical stability and biodegradability.
df['Interaction_Combined'] = df['Carbon_Nitrogen_Oxygen_Interaction'] * df['SM6_L']

# Log_Sine_Complexity
# Log transformation applied after sine adjustment of Complex_Molecular_Interaction.
# Usefulness: Captures drastic changes and reduces skew, potentially highlighting outliers in molecular complexities.
df['Log_Sine_Complexity'] = np.log(1 + np.abs(np.sin(df['Complex_Molecular_Interaction'])))

# Ionization_to_Me_ratio
# Ratio of Ionization_HeavyAtom_Ratio to Mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity.
# Usefulness: Highlights the balance between ionization potential and electronegativity, critical for understanding reactivity.
df['Ionization_to_Me_ratio'] = df['Ionization_HeavyAtom_Ratio'] / df['Me']

# Psi_SM6_L_Difference
# Difference between Psi_i_A and SM6_L.
# Usefulness: Identifies discrepancies in indices related to molecular connectivity, indicative of structural stability.
df['Psi_SM6_L_Difference'] = df['Psi_i_A'] - df['SM6_L']

# Log_Hybrid_Interaction
# Log transformation of Hybrid_Interaction_Index to reduce skew.
# Usefulness: Captures major interaction effects in a normalized manner.
df['Log_Hybrid_Interaction'] = np.log1p(df['Hybrid_Interaction_Index'])

# Exp_Oxygen_Richness
# Exponential growth of Oxygen_Richness_Index to highlight drastic changes.
# Usefulness: Emphasizes extreme oxygen richness which might affect biodegradability.
df['Exp_Oxygen_Richness'] = np.exp(df['Oxygen_Richness_Index'] / 1e6)  # Scaling to manage extreme values

end

Additionally, to simplify the data and enhance meaningful transformations, consider dropping redundant or less informative features:

python
df.drop(columns=['Complex_Molecular_Interaction', 'Hydrophobicity_Index', 'Logarithmic_Complexity_Normalization',
                 'Mean_Electronegativity_Ratio', 'Sine_Structural_Complexity'], inplace=True)
end

These features are selected for their potential to reveal non-linear relationships and synergistic or antagonistic interactions between chemical properties. Focus is on utilizing transformations already present to extract and emphasize crucial variations relevant to biodegradability prediction. Test the impact of these features on the validation score to assess improvement.

In this approach, we focused on generating new features that could provide deeper insights into molecular characteristics impacting biodegradability. Keep an eye on interactions, ratios, and transformations that can highlight subtle nuances in the dataset.

df['Normalized_Oxygen_Hydrogen_Ratio'] = df['Oxygen_Richness_Index'] / df['carbon_oxygen_hydrogen_ratio']


4. Scaled Composite Indices:
   Use combinations and transformations to create scaled composite indices that might differentiate compound properties.

python
# Scaled_Structural_Complexity_Index
# Scale 'Structural_Complexity_Index' based on 'SpMax_B(m)'.
# Usefulness: Might distinguish structural complexity influenced by molecular mass, indicative of discernible biodegradability.
df['Scaled_Structural_Complexity_Index'] = df['Structural_Complexity_Index'] * df['SpMax_B(m)']


5. Binary Features:
   Binary features derived based on thresholds might help separate significant attributes influencing biodegradability.

python
# Is_High_Electronegativity
# Binary feature indicating high electronegativity values.
# Usefulness: Binary encoding regions with above-average electronegativity might correlate with reactivity/binding tendencies.
df['Is_High_Electronegativity'] = (df['Me'] > df['Me'].median()).astype(int)
