   - Reasoning: Encoding the 'savings_status' provides numerical representation of savings levels, potentially revealing insights into the applicant's financial stability, which might impact creditworthiness.

2. <credit_amount_per_person><divide><credit_amount><num_dependents><Credit amount adjusted for number of dependents indicating credit request intensity per individual>
   - Reasoning: Dividing 'credit_amount' by 'num_dependents' adjusts the loan request to the number of people the income must support. This can highlight the intensity of the credit requirement relative to family obligations.

3. <employment_duration_concat><concat><employment><duration><Concatenation of employment duration category and loan duration to reflect stability and economic commitment>
   - Reasoning: Concatenating 'employment' and 'duration' combines data on job stability and loan period, potentially distinguishing applicants who are more stable and committed long-term versus those less stable.

2025-10-30 15:47:19,254 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible steps to generate new features that could enhance the model's performance:

1. Create a feature representing the strength of the applicant's credit history in combination with their current employment status. This could help capture the overall financial stability of the applicant.
   
   <credit_employment_score><cross><credit_history><employment><Cross of credit history and employment status to assess financial stability>
   

2. Develop a feature that measures the affordability of the credit amount in relation to the applicant's estimated income. This feature evaluates an applicant's potential burden based on their reported income category and the requested credit amount.
   
   <affordability_ratio><divide><credit_amount><multiply><installment_commitment><employment><Ratio of credit amount to estimated monthly income reflecting potential financial burden>
   

3. Create a feature that takes into account both property ownership and residence duration to reflect the applicant's long-term financial commitments and stability.
   
   <property_residence_stability><concat><property_magnitude><residence_since><Combination of property magnitude and residence duration indicating financial stability and commitment>
   

Each of these potential new features aims to lend additional insight into the applicant's financial behavior and stability, which could improve creditworthiness predictions.

2025-10-30 15:47:38,774 - INFO - LLM Output: Below are three possible feature engineering steps that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Combining Socio-economic Status with Credit History:
   - <personal_credit_interaction><cross><personal_status><credit_history><Cross of personal status and credit history to evaluate the social and historical factors influencing creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By combining personal_status and credit_history, we can capture how an individual's personal life situations and past credit behaviors are interlinked, which might provide insights into credit approval likelihood.

2. Evaluating Long-term Stability based on Employment and Residence:
   - <employment_residence_stability><concat><employment><residence_since><Combining employment duration with residence duration to assess individual's long-term stability and commitment>
   - Reasoning: Stability in both employment and residence is often viewed favorably by credit issuers as indicators of reliability and commitment, providing a potential advantage in credit approval.

3. Correlation of Age and Credit Intensity:
   - <credit_intensity_by_age><divide><credit_amount_per_person><age><Ratio of credit amount per person to age for insight into credit request intensity in context of life stage>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of credit_amount_per_person to age captures the intensity of credit requests relative to an individual's life stage, offering insights into their financial behavior patterns and capability to handle credit at their current age.

1. \<credit_purpose_interaction\>\<cross\>\<credit_history\>\<purpose\>\<Cross of credit history and purpose to evaluate how past credit performance is related to the credit's intended use\>

   *Reasoning:* This feature captures the interaction between an individual's credit history and the intended use of the credit. Certain purposes might be more successful with particular credit histories, which could impact the credit decision process.

2. \<age_checking_status_interaction\>\<cross\>\<age\>\<checking_status\>\<Cross of age and checking account status to assess how age and financial liquidity are related\>

   *Reasoning:* This feature evaluates the relationship between an individual's age and their existing checking account status. Younger individuals might have different financial liquidity compared to older ones, which could be useful in assessing creditworthiness.

3. \<installment_credit_ratio\>\<divide\>\<installment_commitment\>\<credit_amount\>\<Ratio of installment commitment to credit amount to assess financial burden relative to credit size\>

   *Reasoning:* This feature calculates the proportion of an individual's installment commitment in relation to their requested credit amount. This ratio helps in understanding the financial burden an individual may face relative to the size of the credit they're requesting. This could be indicative of their ability to manage and repay the credit.

2025-10-30 15:47:50,944 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <age_by_duration_ratio><divide><age><duration><Ratio of age to loan duration assessing maturity in handling loans across different durations>: This feature aims to capture the borrower's maturity in handling loans in relation to the loan's duration. Older individuals may be seen as more responsible, and a balanced ratio may indicate better financial planning.

2. <employment_credit_cross><cross><employment><credit_history><Cross of employment status and credit history to evaluate financial stability concerning job tenure and past credit behavior>: Cross-referencing employment status with credit history to assess whether stable employment correlates positively with better credit behavior, providing insight into their reliability as borrowers.

3. <credit_amount_dependency_ratio><divide><credit_amount><num_dependents><Ratio of credit amount to number of dependents evaluating financial burden with regard to family size>: This feature evaluates the credit amount requested in relation to the borrower's family size, offering insight into whether they are taking on a proportional financial burden considering their household responsibilities.

These feature engineering steps are designed to capture the nuanced interactions and relationships specific to creditworthiness, leveraging both existing numerical and categorical insights in a meaningful way.

   Reasoning: The combination of personal status with employment can capture socio-economic dynamics that may influence creditworthiness, such as an individual's ability to maintain stable employment, which could impact their ability to repay a credit. 

2. \<credit_history_savings_concat\>\<concat\>\<credit_history\>\<savings_status\>\<Concatenation of credit history and savings status to assess fiscal responsibility and past payment behavior\>
   Reasoning: By combining credit history with savings status, this feature attempts to integrate past credit behavior with current savings, which could signal fiscal responsibility and improve credit prediction accuracy.

3. \<age_employment_density\>\<divide\>\<age\>\<employment\>\<Ratio of age to employment years capturing maturity and professional experience in context of age\>
   Reasoning: The ratio of age to employment duration provides a sense of maturity and accumulated professional experience in relation to age, which may correlate with financial responsibility and creditworthiness.

2025-10-30 15:48:03,715 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the available operators:

1. \<age_credit_burden_ratio\>\<divide\>\<age\>\<installment_commitment\>\<Ratio of age to installment commitment to assess maturity in handling credit repayment obligations related to age-driven financial responsibilities\>

   - Reasoning: This feature provides insight into how an individual's age relates to the burden of installment commitments. Older individuals might be better positioned to handle higher installments due to maturity and potentially higher income. This can capture potential creditworthiness differentiations associated with age.

2. \<employment_property_stability\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<property_magnitude\>\<Cross of employment status and property magnitude to assess economic stability based on job security and asset ownership\>

   - Reasoning: By evaluating employment status against property ownership, this feature can reveal aspects of financial stability and commitment. Individuals with stable employment and significant property ownership may be deemed more creditworthy.

3. \<credit_purpose_risk\>\<cross\>\<credit_history\>\<purpose\>\<Cross of credit history and credit purpose to evaluate risk associated with intended credit use in light of past credit behaviors\>

   - Reasoning: This feature attempts to quantify the risk by considering past credit performance alongside the current purpose of the requested credit. It helps to contextualize credit requests based on historical behaviors and intended usage, indicating potential risk levels associated with the proposed purpose.

2025-10-30 15:48:08,900 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps to generate features using the operations, aimed at improving the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_history_purpose_interaction><cross><credit_history><purpose><Cross of credit history and purpose to evaluate how past credit performance influences the intended use of a new credit>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between past credit behavior and the reason for the loan application. It may reveal patterns indicating certain purposes are associated with lower risk for individuals with specific credit histories.

2. <checking_status_savings_status_combination><concat><checking_status><savings_status><Combination of checking account status and savings status to assess overall liquidity impacting creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the current status of both checking and savings accounts, potentially indicating an individual's overall liquidity, which is critical in assessing the ability to repay credit.

3. <employment_residence_cross><cross><employment><residence_since><Cross of employment status and residence duration to assess stability based on job security and length of residence>
   - Reasoning: This feature evaluates the stability of an individual by considering both employment duration and how long they have lived at their residence. This could highlight consistency in lifestyle and economic conditions, affecting credit approval.

   Reasoning: This feature evaluates how much credit is needed per individual for each month of the loan. It helps to identify the intensity and sustainability of the credit demand over the loan's duration, providing insights into how manageable the loan is over time for the individual.

2. <personal_status_property_cross><cross><personal_status><property_magnitude><Cross of personal status and property magnitude to evaluate the relationship between social status and asset ownership impacting creditworthiness>

   Reasoning: By considering both personal status and property ownership, this feature aims to capture the socio-economic profile of the individual. Individuals with different statuses may have varying levels of asset ownership, which can significantly impact their credit approval likelihood.

3. <age_employment_combination><concat><age><employment><Concatenation of age and employment status to capture the combined effect of maturity and job stability on creditworthiness>

   Reasoning: The combined feature of age and employment status evaluates both maturity and job stability. Older individuals with more stable employment are often seen as lower-risk borrowers. This feature helps to capture these combined effects in assessing credit risks.

2025-10-30 15:48:26,194 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the available operations. The goal is to bring in additional insights that can potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. Credit History Weighted by Employment Stability:
   - This feature combines employment stability with credit history to assess how stable employment might influence credit outcomes.
    
   <credit_history_employment_weighted><cross><credit_history><employment><Cross of credit history and employment to reflect risk evaluation considering employment stability and past payment behavior>
   

2. Age and Credit Intensity Interaction:
   - This feature captures the interaction between age and credit amount per person, providing insights into how maturity and the intensity of credit requirements per person can affect creditworthiness.
    
   <age_credit_intensity_interaction><cross><age><credit_amount_per_person><Interaction of age and credit amount per person to assess how maturity and credit intensity relate to creditworthiness>
   

3. Duration Stability Ratio:
   - This feature evaluates the stability of the borrower's current employment duration relative to the loan duration. This assessment reflects the borrower's ability to maintain employment throughout the credit period.
    
   <employment_duration_stability_ratio><divide><duration><employment_duration_concat><Evaluating loan duration against concatenated employment duration emphasizing borrower stability throughout credit period>
   

These feature engineering steps focus on crafting unique and insightful features that can reveal deeper interrelationships in the data, enhancing the predictive power of the downstream model.

   Reasoning: This feature explores the potential correlation between a person's age, which can indicate maturity and experience in managing finances, and their housing status—whether they rent, own, or live for free. It assesses how age influences the stability implied by housing choices which may impact credit approval.

2. \<savings_installment_ratio\>\<divide\>\<encoded_savings_status\>\<installment_commitment\>\<Ratio of savings account status to installment commitment to assess financial preparedness against repayment obligations\>

   Reasoning: This feature examines the relationship between the encoded savings status, which numerically indicates a person's liquidity and financial reserve, and their installment commitment, reflecting repayment obligations. The ratio gives insight into potential stress from credit repayments relative to financial preparedness.

3. \<credit_property_interaction\>\<cross\>\<credit_history\>\<property_magnitude\>\<Cross of credit history and property magnitude to investigate how asset ownership corresponds with past credit behavior affecting credit decisions\>

   Reasoning: By crossing credit history, which provides a record of past payment behavior and financial reliability, with property magnitude, which indicates asset ownership level, this feature evaluates how financial asset position correlates with historical credit performance in the context of creditworthiness.

2025-10-30 15:48:38,508 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure! Here are three possible next steps to generate features using the provided operations that could help improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <employment_foreign_perception><cross><employment><foreign_worker><Cross of employment status and foreign worker status to evaluate how employment stability might influence perceptions of foreign workers within loan approval contexts>

   - Reasoning: By understanding the cross interaction between employment status and whether someone is a foreign worker, we can gain insights into how job security might offset any biases or perceptions related to foreign worker status, potentially influencing creditworthiness.

2. <duration_savings_stability><cross><duration><savings_status><Cross of loan duration and savings account status to reflect the potential stability inferred from savings in conjunction with the length of financial commitment requested>

   - Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between an individual's savings account status and the length of financial commitment they are looking to undertake. It can assess if those with certain savings patterns are more likely to manage longer or shorter credit periods effectively.

3. <credit_amount_age_interaction><divide><credit_amount><age><Ratio of credit amount to age to assess the financial request relative to life stage, providing a sense of financial agility or risk-taking behavior based on age>

   - Reasoning: By calculating the ratio of the credit amount to age, we estimate how the requested credit aligns with an individual's life stage. This captures whether younger individuals are prone to take larger risks or if older individuals request credits that align with their financial capacity and life experiences.

2025-10-30 15:48:45,111 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible feature engineering steps aimed at improving the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_risk_signal><cross><checking_status><credit_history><Cross of checking account status and credit history to provide insights regarding potential credit risk based on liquidity and past credit behavior>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the relationship between a person's liquidity (as indicated by their checking account status) and their previous credit behaviors. This could be a strong predictor of creditworthiness due to the assessment of both current financial state and past payment behaviors.

2. <debt_external_obligations_ratio><divide><installment_commitment><num_dependents><Ratio of installment rate to number of dependents providing insight into financial obligations relative to family responsibilities>
   - Reasoning: By relating the installment rate to the number of dependents, this feature measures financial pressures on the household, which can be an important factor in determining credit risk. A higher ratio may indicate larger commitments against available resources.

3. <employment_job_stability_indicator><cross><employment><job><Cross of employment duration and job type to assess stability and qualification level impacting economic security and creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Combining employment duration with job type could help evaluate the stability and level of qualification, which are vital factors in assessing a person's economic security. This could be a significant determinant of one's ability to meet credit obligations.

2025-10-30 15:48:52,996 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <employment_loan_commitment_stability><cross><employment><installment_commitment><Cross of employment duration and installment commitment to assess repayment capacity and stability based on employment tenure and financial obligations>  
   Reasoning: By crossing employment duration with installment commitment, we capture the interplay between job stability and financial obligations. This allows us to gauge how secure and predictable a source of income is in relation to credit repayment obligations, potentially offering insights into the borrower's capacity to manage loan commitments effectively.

2. <personal_property_cross><cross><personal_status><property_magnitude><Cross of personal status and property magnitude to evaluate the relationship between social factors and asset ownership impacting creditworthiness>  
   Reasoning: Crossing personal status with property magnitude helps identify relationships between social factors like marital status or gender and types of property owned. This interaction may reveal socio-economic patterns that affect credit risk, offering additional insights into financial stability for better credit decision-making.

3. <credit_amount_dependency_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><num_dependents><Ratio of credit amount to number of dependents evaluating financial burden with regard to family size>  
   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of the credit amount to the number of dependents provides insight into the financial burden relative to family responsibilities. This feature can reflect how the credit sought weighs against the responsibilities of supporting dependents, offering an understanding of financial strain or risk levels associated with credit repayment while maintaining family needs.

   - Reasoning: By examining the ratio of loan duration to savings status, we can infer the borrower's ability to repay over time versus their savings behavior, which might indicate risk-taking or risk aversion. This feature helps understand if longer-term loans correlate with substantial savings or vice versa.

2. <employment_credit_stability><cross><employment><credit_history><Cross of employment duration and credit history to evaluate financial stability considering job tenure and past credit behavior>
   - Reasoning: Crossing employment duration with credit history provides a nuanced view of the individual's economic stability. Longer employment duration with a favorable credit history might suggest a reliable borrower, whereas short employment tenure with problematic credit history might signal risk.

3. <age_duration_interaction><divide><age><duration><Ratio of age to loan duration to assess maturity and financial responsibility over the proposed repayment timeline>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of age to loan duration aims to evaluate whether older applicants are requesting short-term loans indicative of matured financial planning or younger applicants seeking longer-duration loans, potentially reflecting aggressive risk-taking or reliance on future earnings.

   *Reasoning:* Combining credit history with the purpose of the credit request can provide insights into how past credit behaviors relate to specific intentions for obtaining credit. This can help identify potential risk patterns or preferences for certain credit uses, which could be significant for credit approval decisions.

2. <savings_checking_combination><concat><savings_status><checking_status><Combination of savings and checking account statuses to evaluate overall liquidity and fiscal health through available current and savings assets, providing a comprehensive view of financial liquidity.>

   *Reasoning:* By combining savings and checking account statuses, we can assess an individual's liquidity more holistically, potentially offering better insights into their current financial stability and ability to manage new credit obligations.

3. <employment_housing_stability><cross><employment><housing><Cross of employment status and housing situation to assess the stability and reliability based on job security and housing arrangement, which together could significantly impact creditworthiness.>

   *Reasoning:* Job security, indicated by employment status, combined with housing stability, represented by housing situation, can serve as an indicator of overall socio-economic stability. This feature could help capture the interplay between income stability and living arrangements, which are critical for evaluating credit reliability.
