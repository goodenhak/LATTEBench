3. <marital_income><cross><Married><Income><Interaction_of_marital_status_and_income>

Explanation:

1. <age_debt_ratio><divide><Age><Debt><Ratio_of_age_to_debt>: This feature captures the ratio of a person's age to their debt. A lower ratio might indicate higher financial risk, potentially impacting credit card application success. Older individuals with lower debt might be more successful.

2. <credit_age_ratio><divide><CreditScore><Age><Credit_score_to_age_ratio>: This feature reflects the ratio of a person's credit score to their age, which may indicate financial maturity and responsibility over the years. A higher ratio might suggest a more robust financial profile, aiding in predicting credit card success.

3. <marital_income><cross><Married><Income><Interaction_of_marital_status_and_income>: This interaction feature examines the relationship between marital status and income. Married individuals with higher incomes might be more likely to succeed in their applications due to perceived financial stability.

2025-12-22 11:21:12,832 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the provided dataset features, operators, and previous accepted/rejected features, here are three potential steps for generating new features:

1. Consider Employment Status and Income Interaction:
   - <employment_income_interaction><cross><Employed><Income><Interaction_of_employment_status_and_income>
   - Rationale: The interaction of employment status with scaled income might be insightful as employed individuals usually have a more consistent income stream which could impact their credit card application success. 

2. Debt and Years Employed Ratio:
   - <debt_employment_ratio><divide><Debt><YearsEmployed><Ratio_of_debt_to_years_employed>
   - Rationale: A higher debt compared to employment duration might indicate financial instability, which could affect credit card approval. Analyzing this ratio could help in understanding this dynamic more clearly.

3. Citizenship Status Encoding:
   - <citizenship_encoded><label_encode><Citizen><Encoded_citizenship_status>
   - Rationale: Encoding categorical features like citizenship status into numerical values can help in capturing how variation in citizenship might relate to credit card approval, making it more accessible for certain modeling techniques.

These steps aim to generate features that could potentially enhance the predictive performance of the downstream task by considering interactions, ratios, and encodings that might reveal more about the individual’s likelihood of credit card application success.

2025-12-22 11:21:17,022 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <income_sqrt><sqrt><Income><Square_root_of_income>  
   Reasoning: The sqrt operator can help to stabilize the variance of the Income feature. Income is highly skewed, and taking the square root can help reduce the skewness, potentially improving the predictive power of models that assume normality or have issues with outliers.

2. <employment_credit_ratio><divide><YearsEmployed><CreditScore><Ratio_of_years_employed_to_credit_score>  
   Reasoning: Creating a ratio between YearsEmployed and CreditScore may provide insights into the relationship between stable employment and creditworthiness. A higher ratio could indicate a higher reliability in repayment capabilities despite the defaulted credit score, potentially identifying good credit card candidates.

3. <debt_industry_encoded><label_encode><Industry><Encoded_industry_for_debt_interaction>  
   Reasoning: Encoding the Industry category in conjunction with Debt might help capture the different financial profiles associated with different job sectors. This can help the model understand which industries are generally more reliable in terms of dealing with debts.

2025-12-22 11:21:22,835 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps to generate features, building on the dataset's structure and statistical insights to potentially improve the downstream credit card application prediction model:

1. Interaction of Ethnicity and Income Variance  
   The idea here is to explore whether different ethnic groups experience varying levels of income variation within their respective Zip Codes, which could affect creditworthiness or credit card application success differently. This feature aims to capture any interaction effect between a person's ethnicity and the economic variability in their environment.
   
   <ethnicity_income_variance_interaction><cross><Ethnicity><zip_income_variance><Interaction_of_ethnicity_and_zip_income_variance>
   

2. Normalized Risk Score  
   By using the prior default status and the credit score, this feature attempts to assess the inherent risk. A person with prior defaults might have a diminished standing regardless of their current credit score. Creating this feature normalizes this risk across different credit scores and default backgrounds.
   
   <normalized_risk_score><divide><CreditScore><PriorDefault><Normalized_credit_risk_based_on_prior_default>
   

3. Age Group Employment Stability  
   Employment stability across various age groups might provide insights into credit card application successes. Younger individuals might have less stable employment but more long-term potential, whereas older individuals might display more stability. This feature will attempt to segment this aspect.
   
   <age_group_employment_stability><groupbythenmean><Age><YearsEmployed><Mean_employment_years_by_age_group>
    

These features target interactions and characteristics that could influence credit card application outcomes, particularly focusing on financial stability and demographic groups, while utilizing existing feature relationships and adding context to numerical variations within the dataset.

2025-12-22 11:21:27,178 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential new feature engineering steps:

1. <income_employment_ratio><divide><Income><YearsEmployed><Income_to_years_employed_ratio>
   - Reasoning: The income to years employed ratio might provide insights into an individual's earning potential, given their work experience. This could be indicative of financial stability, which is a relevant factor in credit card application success.

2. <credit_zscore><zscore><CreditScore><Z_score_of_credit_score>
   - Reasoning: By standardizing the credit score, we can better assess an individual's credit worthiness relative to the population. This could provide significant information on their likelihood of success in credit card applications.

3. <citizenship_employment_cross><cross><Citizen><Employed><Interaction_of_citizenship_and_employment_status>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between citizenship status and employment could highlight stability or risk factors associated with the applicant's profile as different citizenship statuses might impact job security or tenure, which could influence their credit application success.

These feature engineering steps aim to improve the predictability of credit card application success by generating features that capture potentially overlooked contributing factors.

2025-12-22 11:21:32,572 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could improve the model's performance through creative combinations of the existing features:

1. ZipCode Debt Dispersion:
   - <zipcode_debt_std><groupbythenstd><ZipCode><Debt><Standard_deviation_of_debt_by_zip_code>
   - *Reasoning*: This feature calculates the standard deviation of debt levels within each zip code, capturing the financial variability and stability within areas. High variability may indicate regions with diverse financial circumstances, which could correlate with credit application success.

2. Marital Age Interaction:
   - <marital_age_interaction><cross><Married><Age><Interaction_of_marital_status_and_age>
   - *Reasoning*: By cross-referencing marital status with age, this feature may capture important socio-economic indicators that could affect credit application outcomes. Different age groups within marital statuses may present different risks or credibility levels to credit providers.

3. Employment and Citizenship Status:
   - <employment_citizenship_cross><cross><Employed><Citizen><Interaction_between_employment_and_citizenship_status>
   - *Reasoning*: This feature explores the interaction between employment status and citizenship, providing insights into stability and convenience for potential lending. For instance, employed individuals with different citizenship statuses might exhibit varying risk profiles and likelihoods of credit approval. 

These engineered features target socioeconomic, financial variability, and stability attributes that may influence credit application outcomes, aiming to enhance predictive capability through nuanced data representation.

2025-12-22 11:21:48,217 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <income_age_interaction><cross><Income><Age><Interaction_of_income_and_age>
   This feature explores the relationship between an individual's income and age, capturing variations in the ability to earn and financial maturity. Since income and age are both numerical, crossing them could help uncover patterns that differentiate successful credit card applicants based on economic stability over time.

2. <credit_debt_ratio><divide><CreditScore><Debt><Ratio_of_credit_score_to_debt>
   This feature captures the relative standing of an individual's credit score in relation to their debt. A higher ratio indicates better credit management, potentially crucial in determining creditworthiness.

3. <employment_duration_bin><bin><YearsEmployed><Employment_duration_category>
   With YearsEmployed being a numerical feature, binning it will help categorize employment stability over different terms. This feature aims to assist in predicting credit card application success by understanding how employment duration impacts credit approval likelihood, providing clarity to models on stability over job tenure.

   - Reasoning: Prior credit defaults can significantly influence the likelihood of credit card application success. Combining this with the credit score can yield insights into how past defaults interact with current credit scores, potentially revealing patterns of behavior that distinguish successful applicants.

2. <age_citizenship_interaction><cross><Age><Citizen><Interaction_of_age_and_citizenship_status>
   - Reasoning: Age and citizenship status may together impact credit card application outcomes. Older applicants might have different financial behaviors or opportunities based on their citizenship status, potentially influencing application success rates.

3. <zscore_income><zscore><Income><Z_score_of_income>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing the Income feature could help identify outliers or detect patterns that might correlate with credit card success. Since the existing features suggest income's broad range and variability, normalizing it could make it more comparable across different applicants and reveal its influence on credit card application success.

Understanding how age influences credit score might provide insights into credit worthiness and thus potentially improve predictions for credit card application success.

2. <employment_citizenship_encoded><label_encode><Citizen><Encoded_citizenship_status>: Encoding the Citizenship status as a numerical feature allows the model to consider the different citizenship types in a more nuanced way. This can be important because citizenship might affect employment stability and consequently the likelihood of credit card approval.

3. <income_zipgroup_mean><groupbythenmean><ZipCode><Income><Mean_income_by_zip_code>: Grouping income by ZipCode and taking the mean can highlight regional economic conditions that could affect credit card approval. It leverages geographic patterns to potentially identify areas with stronger economic stability, which might correlate with higher success rates in credit card applications.

2025-12-22 11:22:08,088 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Let's generate features that could potentially enhance predictive performance based on the information from the dataset. 

### Step 1: Debts relative to Income Standard Deviation

1. Reasoning: The Debt to zip_income_variance ratio may give insight into how burdensome an individual's debt is in the context of income variability in their area. Areas with high income variance might indicate socioeconomic diversity, which can affect spending habits and credit risk.

   <debt_income_variance_ratio><divide><Debt><zip_income_variance><Ratio_of_debt_to_income_variance>

### Step 2: Marital and Employment Interaction 

2. Reasoning: By examining the interaction between marital status and employment status, we can potentially identify patterns where being married and employed together could affect credit card application success differently compared to being single and employed or other combinations. 

   <marital_employment_interaction><cross><Married><Employed><Interaction_of_marital_status_and_employment_status>

### Step 3: Ethnicity and Industry Interaction

3. Reasoning: Interaction between Ethnicity and Industry might provide insights into industry-specific cultural trends, biases, or opportunities that could impact credit card success. Industries might vary in terms of diversity and opportunities for different ethnicities, thereby impacting credit access.

   <ethnicity_industry_interaction><cross><Ethnicity><Industry><Interaction_of_ethnicity_and_industry>

These steps aim to address socio-economic factors, employment stability, and diversity considerations, potentially revealing nuances impacting credit card application success.
