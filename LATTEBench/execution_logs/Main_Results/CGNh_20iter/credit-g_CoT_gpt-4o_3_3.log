   - Reasoning: Combining checking account status with savings status could reveal insights about the individual's overall financial health and liquidity, both of which are crucial factors in determining creditworthiness.

2. <age_duration_ratio><ratio><age><duration><Ratio_of_age_to_duration_to_understand_age_dependency_on_credit_duration>
   - Reasoning: Creating a ratio between age and credit duration can help to understand the relationship between the borrower's age and the length of time they need credit. This might reveal age-related risk factors that could influence credit decisions.

3. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm_of_credit_amount_to_reduce_skewness_and_handle_outliers>
   - Reasoning: Applying a logarithm transformation to the credit amount can help manage skewness and reduce the impact of outliers, potentially leading to improved model performance by normalizing the distribution of credit amounts.

2025-10-30 15:43:18,938 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating features using the available operations:

1. <checking_savings_interaction><cross><checking_status><savings_status><Interaction_between_checking_account_status_and_savings_account_status_to_capture_combined_effect_on_credit_decision>

Explanation: By creating an interaction feature between checking account status and savings account status, we can capture any potential combined effects these might have on the likelihood of receiving credit. Such interactions can sometimes reveal patterns that are not apparent when these features are considered independently.

2. <employment_duration_product><multiply><employment_label><duration><Product_of_employment_duration_and_duration_to_capture_exposure_and_stability>

Explanation: This feature multiplies the numerical encoding of employment duration by the credit duration. It aims to capture how the length of employment might influence credit duration decisions, potentially highlighting the stability of the applicant and their financial reliability over the credit term.

3. <monthly_payment_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration_as_a_proxy_for_monthly_payment_amount>

Explanation: By dividing the credit amount by the duration, we obtain a feature that approximates the monthly payment amount. This can be a critical feature as it represents the financial burden of the applicant in terms of monthly payments, a key consideration in credit decisions.

2025-10-30 15:43:33,650 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <savings_employment_cross><cross><savings_status><employment><Interaction_between_savings_status_and_employment_status_to_capture_combined_effect_on_credit_decision>  
   Reasoning: Both savings status and employment status are critical indicators of an individual's financial stability and ability to repay credit. By creating an interaction feature between these two categorical features, we can better capture their combined influence on creditworthiness.

2. <credit_amount_log><log><credit_amount><Logarithm_of_credit_amount_to_reduce_skewness_and_handle_outliers>
   Reasoning: Applying a logarithm transformation to the credit amount feature can help reduce skewness and manage any outliers present in the data. This transformation would make the variable more normally distributed, which is often beneficial for downstream predictive models.

3. <age_property_cross><cross><age_instalment_commitment_ratio><property_magnitude><Interaction_between_age_adjusted_payment_burden_and_property_magnitude_to_capture_risk_level>
   Reasoning: By creating a cross-feature between the age-adjusted installment commitment ratio and property magnitude, we can gain insights into how the property type interacts with an individual's age and financial commitment, potentially capturing differences in risk levels related to property ownership.

1. <checking_employment_interaction><cross><checking_status><employment><Capture_combined_effect_of_checking_account_status_and_employment_duration_on_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: By capturing the interaction between checking account status and employment duration, this feature may provide insights into the applicant's financial stability and capability to fulfill credit obligations, contributing to a more precise prediction.

2. <duration_installment_ratio><ratio><duration><installment_commitment><Ratio_of_loan_duration_to_installment_commitment_as_a_proxy_for_repayment_burden_over_time>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of loan duration to installment commitment could highlight how stretched or manageable a repayment schedule is relative to the applicant's capacity to meet installment obligations, offering a nuanced perspective on credit risk.

3. <property_savings_cross><cross><property_magnitude><savings_status><Interaction_between_property_and_savings_status_to_understand_combination_of_assets_and_liquidity>

2025-10-30 15:44:08,720 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the available operations, aiming to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <checking_status_payment_plan_cross><cross><checking_status><other_payment_plans><Interaction_between_checking_account_status_and_other_payment_plans_to_capture_combined_effect_on_credit_decision>
   - Reasoning: Combining the checking account status with the type of other payment plans can help capture the financial behavior of individuals, which might have an impact on their creditworthiness. For instance, someone with no checking account but with other payment plans might be an indicator of specific financial habits.

2. <credit_amortization_ratio><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_installment_commitment_as_a_proxy_for_credit_amortization_over_time>
   - Reasoning: This feature calculates the amortization ratio, indicating how the credit amount is spread across installment commitments. A higher ratio may suggest a heavier debt burden relative to income, potentially affecting credit decisions.

3. <employment_purpose_cross><cross><employment><purpose><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_purpose_of_credit_to_capture_combined_effect_on_loan_approval_decision>
   - Reasoning: The purpose of the credit in conjunction with the employment status can reveal important patterns about why individuals with certain jobs are applying for specific types of loans. This cross-feature can highlight trends such as job stability aligned with specific loan purposes, impacting the likelihood of receiving credit.

These suggestions aim to provide additional insights into individual behaviors and circumstances that could influence credit decisions, thereby potentially improving prediction accuracy in the downstream task.

2025-10-30 15:44:14,276 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate additional features that might improve the model's performance in predicting whether a person receives credit, we can apply feature engineering techniques considering the interactions between different attributes and transformations to help capture complex relationships. Here are three possible next steps:

1. <savings_credit_ratio><ratio><credit_amount><savings_status><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_savings_status_to_understand_budget_impact_on_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: A ratio between credit amount and savings status can help identify how well a person's savings can support the requested credit, potentially indicating their financial stability.

2. <employment_duration_exp><exp><employment><Exponentiate_employment_duration_for_capturing_non_linear_effect_of_work_experience_on_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Exponentiating employment duration will capture non-linear relationships, as longer employment might exponentially improve creditworthiness due to job stability.

3. <personal_dependents_cross><cross><personal_status><num_dependents><Interaction_between_personal_status_and_number_of_dependents_to_understand_family_burden_effect_on_credit_decision>
   - Reasoning: Cross-multiply personal status with the number of dependents, as the combination may affect how credit assessments consider family-related financial burdens.

2025-10-30 15:44:19,817 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering:

1. <duration_installment_ratio><ratio><duration><installment_commitment><Ratio_of_duration_to_installment_commitment_to_understand_monthly_payment_burden>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the relationship between the loan duration and installment commitment. Loans with a longer duration but lower installment commitments might indicate a lower financial burden, potentially affecting credit approval negatively. Conversely, higher installment commitments relative to duration may reflect a greater financial burden, affecting creditworthiness.

2. <credit_history_property_cross><cross><credit_history><property_magnitude><Interaction_between_credit_history_and_property_type_to_capture_asset_based_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Combining credit history with property magnitude will help capture the effect of possessing significant assets in relation to credit history. For example, someone with real estate may be perceived as more creditworthy despite a poor credit history.

3. <age_dependents_interaction><cross><age_instalment_commitment_ratio><num_dependents><Interaction_between_age_adjusted_payment_burden_and_number_of_dependents_to_accommodate_family_related_financial_burden>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interplay between the age-adjusted financial burden of installment commitments and the number of dependents. More dependents might indicate a greater family-related financial burden, which could impact credit approval, especially if the age-adjusted payment burden is high.

2025-10-30 15:44:27,411 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features, aiming to improve the predictive performance of the downstream model:

1. <property_duration_risk_cross><cross><property_magnitude><duration><Interaction_between_property_magnitude_and_loan_duration_to_capture_asset_based_risk_for_long-term_credits>  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between the type of property a person owns and the duration of the loan. Individuals with more substantial assets might be more reliable over different loan durations, adding valuable information on credit risk.

2. <employment_dependents_ratio><ratio><employment><num_dependents><Ratio_of_employment_duration_to_number_of_dependents_to_assess_financial_stability_in_supporting_dependents>  
   Reasoning: This feature evaluates financial stability and responsibility by determining how long someone has been employed relative to the number of dependents. This ratio might have implications for creditworthiness and repayment capacity, reflecting their ability to maintain financial obligations while supporting dependents.

3. <personal_savings_cross><cross><personal_status><savings_status><Interaction_between_personal_status_and_savings_status_to_capture_comprehensive_financial_profile_on_creditworthiness>  
   Reasoning: This feature synthesizes a person's personal status with their savings account status, offering a nuanced understanding of their financial background. Integrating these aspects can provide additional insight into an individual's overall financial health, potentially impacting credit decision-making.

2025-10-30 15:44:35,974 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To generate new features that may improve the model's performance, we'll consider different interactions and transformations that capture potentially non-linear and complex relationships in the data.

### 1. Interaction Between Purpose and Age-Adjusted Payment Burden
Reasoning: Understanding how the purpose of the credit interacts with the age-adjusted payment burden can provide insights into how different credit purposes affect payment behavior, adjusted for age-related income stability.

plaintext
<purpose_age_payment_cross><cross><purpose><age_instalment_commitment_ratio><Interaction_between_purpose_of_credit_and_age_adjusted_payment_burden_to_capture_credit_purpose_risks>


### 2. Standardized Credit Amount with Credit Purpose Interaction
Reasoning: By standardizing credit amounts and interacting with credit purposes, we can control for scale effects and train the model to learn relative credit amounts differently for each purpose, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

plaintext
<credit_amount_zscore><zscore><credit_amount><Standardize_credit_amount_to_have_mean_zero_and_unit_variance>
<purpose_credit_zscore_cross><cross><purpose><credit_amount_zscore><Interaction_between_standardized_credit_amount_and_purpose_of_credit>


### 3. Employment and Existing Credits Interaction
Reasoning: Understanding how employment duration interacts with the number of existing credits can offer insights into financial stability and borrower risk, given that steady income may influence the management of multiple credits.

plaintext
<employment_credits_cross><cross><employment><existing_credits><Interaction_between_employment_duration_and_number_of_existing_credits_to_capture_credit_management_stability>


Each of these features aims to capture different aspects of financial behavior and risk that might not be immediately apparent from the individual features alone, potentially improving the model's ability to differentiate between creditworthy and non-creditworthy individuals.

2025-10-30 15:44:51,619 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential next steps for generating new features using various operations to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <credit_amount_duration_log_interaction><log><credit_amount_duration_interaction><Logarithmic_transformation_of_interaction_between_credit_amount_and_duration_to_handle_outliers_and_capture_nonlinear_relationships>  
   Reasoning: The credit_amount_duration_interaction feature has a wide range and high standard deviation, suggesting that a logarithmic transformation could help mitigate outliers and skewness in the data.

2. <checking_history_property_combined><cross><checking_status><property_magnitude><Combined_effect_of_checking_account_status_and_property_magnitude_on_creditworthiness>  
   Reasoning: By crossing checking_status with property_magnitude, this feature aims to capture a combined effect of financial status indicated by the checking account and property ownership on the credit decision, providing insight into asset-based creditworthiness.

3. <age_dependents_ratio><ratio><age_instalment_commitment_ratio><num_dependents><Ratio_of_age_adjusted_payment_burden_to_number_of_dependents_to_account_for_family_related_financial_stability>  
   Reasoning: Creating a ratio between age_instalment_commitment_ratio and num_dependents can provide information about how the age-adjusted payment burden is influenced relative to the family size, potentially affecting credit approval likelihood and helping to capture the family's financial stability.

2025-10-30 15:44:57,943 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features:

1. Feature 1: Interaction between Employment Status and Installment Commitment
   - <employment_installment_cross><cross><employment><installment_commitment><Interaction_between_employment_status_and_installment_commitment_to_capture_combined_effect_on_creditworthiness>
   - *Reasoning:* This feature captures the interaction between the employment duration and the installment commitment. A person's employment stability combined with their financial commitment ratio could reflect their ability to consistently meet their installment obligations.

2. Feature 2: Combined Effect of Savings Status and Credit History
   - <savings_credit_history_cross><cross><savings_status><credit_history><Combined_effect_of_savings_status_and_credit_history_to_understand_long_term_financial_stability_and_behavior>
   - *Reasoning:* Combining savings status and credit history can capture both the liquidity and financial behavior aspects of an individual. This interaction could help in assessing the long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of an applicant.

3. Feature 3: Adjusted Monthly Payment Burden
   - <monthly_payment_ratio><divide><credit_amount><duration><Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_duration_as_a_proxy_for_monthly_payment_amount>
   - <adjusted_monthly_payment_burden><divide><monthly_payment_ratio><num_dependents><Adjusted_monthly_payment_burden_to_account_for_family_size>
   - *Reasoning:* Understanding the payment burden adjusted by the number of dependents gives a clearer picture of an individual's financial obligations relative to their household size, which is often critical in credit assessments. First, calculate a proxy for the monthly payment using credit amount and duration, then adjust this for the number of dependents to gauge real financial burden.
