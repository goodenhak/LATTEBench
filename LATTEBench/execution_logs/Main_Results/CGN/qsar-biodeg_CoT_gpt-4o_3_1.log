2025-09-02 00:26:14,273 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<nHM_exp\><exp><nHM><Exponential transformation of nHM to capture potential nonlinear effects\>  
   Reasoning: Applying an exponential transformation to nHM may help capture nonlinear relationships in the data, as nHM describes the number of heavy atoms, which can have a significant impact on the chemical properties and biodegradability.

2. \<SpMax_L_zscore\><zscore><SpMax_L><Standardized version of SpMax_L to remove the effect of scale and maintain consistency across samples\>  
   Reasoning: Applying z-score normalization helps in centering and scaling the SpMax_L feature, allowing the model to focus on the relative position of values within the dataset, which may be useful for detecting outliers or subtle variations affecting biodegradability.

3. \<SdO_ratio_nO\><ratio><SdO><nO><Ratio of SdO to nO to determine the average E-state for each oxygen atom\>  
   Reasoning: Creating a ratio of the sum of dO E-states to the number of oxygen atoms (SdO / nO) allows for the assessment of the average electronic state associated with each oxygen atom, which could play an important role in biodegradability by influencing reactivity or stability.

   Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation can help in capturing non-linear relationships, especially for features with skewed distributions such as SpMax_L. This transformation often stabilizes variance and can reveal patterns that are not apparent otherwise.

2. <nHM_categorical><bin><nHM><Categorize_nHM_into_discrete_categories>
   Reasoning: The feature 'nHM' has a range from 0 to 10, with a majority of values concentrated around 0 to 1 based on quartiles. Binning this feature into categories can help the model understand threshold effects or interactions at particular intensities of the feature.

3. <FeatureInteraction><multiply><C%><nO><Interaction_between_C_and_O_content>
   Reasoning: Interactions between features, such as the percentage of carbon atoms (C%) and the number of oxygen atoms (nO), can provide insights into the chemical composition and its potential impact on the property being predicted. Multiplying these features emphasizes cases where both elements play a significant role.

   Rationale: This feature captures the interaction between benzene carbon atoms and nitrogen atoms, which could influence the biodegradability due to their chemical relationships and tendencies to form stable structures.

2. \<heavy_atoms_log\> \<log\> \<nHM\> \<Log_transformed_number_of_heavy_atoms\>

   Explanation: Squaring the SpMax_L feature could help capture nonlinear relationships between this feature and the target as it introduces a nonlinear transformation that might be more aligned with the underlying patterns in the data. 

2. <interaction_No_O_N><multiply><nN><nO><Interaction_between_the_number_of_Nitrogen_and_Oxygen_atoms>

   Explanation: Interacting nN and nO could potentially capture complex relationships between the number of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in affecting the biodegradability class. This reflects possible synergistic effects these atoms might have on the molecular structure.

3. <normalized_C_percent><zscore><C%><Z-score_normalization_of_percentage_of_C_atoms>

   Explanation: Applying Z-score normalization to the C% feature helps to standardize it. This can help in making the feature scale-independent and could potentially improve model performance by allowing better integration with other features with different scales.

   - Reasoning: SpMax_L and HyWi_B(m) are both eigenvalue-based features that describe the molecular structure. Their product might reveal complex interactions affecting biodegradability.

2. <weighted_N_C_interaction><multiply><nN><C%><Interaction_between_number_of_Nitrogen_atoms_and_carbon_content>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between nitrogen atoms and the percentage of carbon in a molecule may influence biodegradability because both element types play critical roles in the chemical structure and properties of the compound.

3. <TI2_L_normalized><zscore><TI2_L><Z-score_normalization_of_TI2_L_to_standardize_the_feature_for_model_input>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing TI2_L can help eliminate bias introduced by the feature's range, thus ensuring it contributes fairly when combined with other features in a machine learning model. This step is essential for features with wide variance in numerical scale.
