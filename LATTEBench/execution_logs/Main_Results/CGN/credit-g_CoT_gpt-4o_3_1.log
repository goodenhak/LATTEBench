   Reasoning: Transforming the categorical 'employment' feature into a numerical format can help some algorithms better understand the data and may uncover new patterns related to employment status.

2. <total_credit_weight><plus><credit_amount><critical_credit_duration_weight><Combined_effect_of_credit_amount_and_credit_history_on_creditworthiness>  
   Reasoning: Summing the 'credit_amount' with 'critical_credit_duration_weight' can give a new perspective on the impact of both the credit amount and the credit history duration on the likelihood of receiving credit.

3. <job_duration_interaction><cross><job><duration><Interaction_between_job_type_and_duration_of_credit>  
   Reasoning: Creating an interaction feature between 'job' and 'duration' may reveal if certain job types with specific credit durations have a different likelihood of receiving credit, thus providing additional insights for the model.

1. \<savings_status_num\>\<label_encode\>\<savings_status\>\<encode_savings_status_into_numerical\>: This feature converts the categorical savings status into a numerical form, allowing better understanding and usage in numerical computations.

2. \<credit_to_income_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<employment_encoded\>\<ratio_of_credit_amount_to_employment\>: This feature calculates the ratio of credit amount to employment status, assuming employment_encoded is indicative of income level, to understand credit burden relative to employment stability.

3. \<age_amount_cross_job\>\<cross\>\<age_creditamount_ratio\>\<job\>\<interaction_of_age_credit_ratio_with_job_type\>: Cross the age to credit amount ratio with job type to capture any relationship between a person's job category and how their age and requested credit amount interact.

2025-09-01 20:58:25,784 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<employment_duration_interact\>\<cross\>\<employment\>\<duration\>\<interaction_between_employment_status_and_credit_duration\>  
   Reasoning: Interactions between employment status and duration of credit might capture variations in creditworthiness, as certain employment statuses might be more stable over longer periods.

2. \<credit_amount_savings_status_interact\>\<cross\>\<credit_amount\>\<savings_status\>\<interaction_between_credit_amount_and_savings_status\>  
   Reasoning: Understanding how credit amounts interact with savings status can capture individual financial behavior patterns, potentially indicating how savings relate to various credit sizes.

3. \<age_credit_ratio_bin\>\<bin\>\<age_creditamount_ratio\>\<binned_age_to_credit_amount_ratio_for_categorical_analysis\>  
   Reasoning: Binning the age to credit amount ratio could allow us to detect thresholds where younger vs. older individuals might differ in their credit behavior, making pattern detection easier in categorical forms.

   This feature calculates the ratio of credit duration to an encoded version of savings status. By encoding the categorical savings status and dividing by the credit duration, we can gauge the weight of savings status on the term duration, potentially highlighting different risk profiles based on savings.

2. <job_employment_concatenated><concat><job><employment_encoded><Concatenated_job_and_employment_encoding_for_credit_assessment>  
   By concatenating the job category with the encoded employment status, we create a composite feature that can reveal specific patterns related to employment longevity and job type. This helps in assessing credit applications, as certain combinations might indicate more stability and therefore lower risk.

3. <credit_amount_age_log_ratio><log><age_creditamount_ratio><Logarithm_of_age_credit_amount_ratio_to_reduce_skewness>  
   Applying a logarithmic transformation to the age to credit amount ratio can stabilize variability and reduce potential skewness in the distribution, helping the model to learn more effectively from the pattern of younger applicants requesting particular credit amounts.
