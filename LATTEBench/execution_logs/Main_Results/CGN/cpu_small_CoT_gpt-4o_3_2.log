2025-10-15 00:58:18,462 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering using the given operators:

1. \<cpu_intensity_score\>\<ratio\>\<scall\>\<sread\>\<Ratio of system calls to system read calls; a high ratio might indicate heavy CPU usage due to frequent system calls\>

2. \<memory_pressure\>\<ratio\>\<freemem\>\<lread\>\<Ratio of free memory to memory read operations; a low value might indicate high memory pressure and intensive system resource utilization\>

3. \<normalized_run_queue_size\>\<zscore\>\<runqsz\>\<Z-score normalization of the process run queue size to transform the feature into a standard score, which could help in identifying anomalies in the queue size indicative of high CPU load\>

Reasoning:

1. cpu_intensity_score: The ratio of system calls (\<scall\>) to system read calls (\<sread\>) can highlight the CPU intensity for performing operations that need system interaction. A high ratio may be indicative of a high CPU usage scenario, which could be predictive of increased CPU time in user mode.

2. memory_pressure: The ratio of free memory (\<freemem\>) to memory read operations (\<lread\>) might highlight how memory resources are being managed. If free memory is low compared to the volume of memory reads, it could imply memory pressure, affecting CPU operations and their efficiency.

3. normalized_run_queue_size: Applying Z-score normalization to the process run queue size (\<runqsz\>) helps in standardizing this feature for better downstream model performance by transforming it into a format that highlights deviations from the norm. This can identify states where the run queue size is unusually large or small, impacting CPU time usage predictions.

2025-10-15 00:58:37,576 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible next steps for generating new features to improve the downstream task of predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode, using the operations available:

1. \<io_ratio\>\<divide\>\<lread\>\<lwrite\>\<io_ratio_(lread/lwrite)\>  
   - Reasoning: The ratio between memory reads and writes (lread/lwrite) might provide insights into the system's I/O behavior. A higher ratio could indicate a scenario where the system is more read-heavy, which might correlate with certain user activities or system states, and potentially with user mode CPU times.

2. \<syscall_per_read\>\<divide\>\<scall\>\<sread\>\<ratio_of_scalls_per_sread\>  
   - Reasoning: By calculating the ratio of the number of system calls to system read calls, we could gain insights into how system calls relate to reading operations. This feature might capture specific system use patterns relevant to CPU user mode time.

3. \<cpu_usage_intensity\>\<multiply\>\<exec\>\<fork\>\<product_of_exec_and_fork_intensity\>  
   - Reasoning: The product of exec and fork intensity might reflect the load caused by creating new processes. Systems that frequently fork and execute new programs could exhibit different CPU user mode usage patterns, thus providing valuable information for prediction.

These new features aim to capture complex interactions or usage patterns that may not be immediately obvious from the raw data, thereby potentially boosting the prediction model's performance.

3. <executions_intensity><multiply><exec><fork><Intensity_of_process_creation_and_execution_activity>

Reasoning:

1. cpu_activity_ratio: This feature uses the ratio operator on system calls (scall) and system reads (sread). A higher ratio might suggest that the CPU is bound more by the system calls than by reading operations. Such an indicator could be a useful predictor for CPU utilization in user mode, given the processing overhead associated with system calls is typically more significant than individual read operations.

2. memory_efficiency: By dividing the number of free memory pages (freemem) by the number of memory reads (lread), you get a feature reflecting memory usage efficiency. Higher values indicate that the system has more free memory relative to the memory operations it performs, potentially suggesting less CPU pressure. This can be pivotal in understanding and predicting CPU usage patterns.

3. executions_intensity: The product of exec and fork operations represents the overall intensity of process creation and execution activities. A highly active process creation and management environment is likely to impact CPU usage, making this a significant potential predictor for the portion of time CPUs spend in user mode.

2025-10-15 00:59:24,248 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <cpu_intensity_ratio><ratio><scall><freemem><Ratio_of_system_calls_to_available_memory>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the intensity of system calls in relation to available memory. A higher ratio might indicate higher CPU load when memory is constrained or being actively managed.

2. <io_to_cpu_ratio><ratio><lread_plus_lwrite><scall><Ratio_of_IO_operations_to_system_calls>
   - Reasoning: This feature measures the proportion of I/O operations (reads and writes) relative to the number of system calls, which can provide insights into the workload characteristics impacting CPU usage. It combines lread and lwrite first, then compares that to scall.

3. <active_processes><subtract><runqsz><freemem><Active_process_queue_size_after_subtracting_free_memory_effects>
   - Reasoning: This feature estimates the effective load on the CPU's process queue by considering available memory, providing a more adjusted view of CPU demand. Subtracting freemem from runqsz highlights situations where limited memory may be inflating the perceived load.

2025-10-15 01:00:44,188 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! When creating new features, it's important to focus on enhancing the signal in the data that relates to the target variable, which in this case is the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode. Here are three potential feature engineering steps that could help improve model predictions:

1. \<system_load\<ratio\<scall\<freemem\<Ratio_of_system_calls_to_free_memory: The intuition here is that the number of system calls relative to the free memory characterizes system load, providing insights into how the system's state might impact CPU time in user mode.
   
2. \<io_efficiency\<ratio\<rchar\<wchar\<I/O_efficiency_ratio: This feature focuses on the relative throughput of read and write operations, which can influence CPU operations if, for example, high read volumes are indicative of CPU-intensive tasks.

3. \<normalized_lread\<zscore\<lread\<Z-scored_lread_to_normalize: Normalizing lread provides it in a form that's invariant to scale which can help the model give consistent attention to lread across its distribution, minimizing skew effects.

These feature engineering steps aim to enhance the data representation concerning the system's performance attributes and resource utilization characteristics.
