   - Reasoning: The ratio of memory reads to the available free memory can provide insight into how memory operations are affecting CPU user mode utilization. High memory access relative to available memory might indicate higher CPU usage due to memory-bound processes.

2. <total_io_calls><plus><sread><swrite><Total_system_IO_calls_per_second>
   - Reasoning: The sum of read and write system calls provides a measure of the total I/O workload on the system. A high number of I/O operations might correlate with increased CPU time in user mode because user processes often block on I/O operations.

3. <normalized_runqsz><zscore><runqsz><Zscore_normalized_run_queue_size>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the run queue size using z-score can help identify periods when the run queue size is unusually high or low relative to its distribution. This can be related to higher CPU user mode time as larger run queues indicate more processes waiting for CPU time.

2025-10-15 01:04:08,014 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three possible next steps for feature engineering using the provided operators to potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <cpu_bound_indicator> <greater> <scall> <freemem> <cpu_bound_indicator_assuming_higher_system_calls_relative_to_memory>
   - Reasoning: This feature estimates how CPU-bound the workload might be by comparing the number of system calls with available memory. Higher system calls relative to memory might indicate more CPU-intensive tasks, which could correlate with higher CPU usage in user mode.

2. <io_intensity> <plus> <lread> <lwrite> <io_intensity_estimate_based_on_total_memory_transfers>
   - Reasoning: This feature gauges I/O intensity by summing the reads and writes transfers between system and user memory, potentially affecting CPU usage patterns. This could be useful since high I/O operations might correlate to certain CPU behavior.

3. <process_load_indicator> <multiply> <runqsz> <fork> <estimate_of_process_load_on_cpu>
   - Reasoning: This feature is designed to give a sense of the processing load by multiplying the process run queue size by the number of fork calls. An increase in both might imply a high process load affecting CPU's user mode performance.

These transformations aim to create more expressive features that capture different aspects of system usage, helping in predicting CPU time spent in user mode.

3. \<memory_usage_rate\> \<divide\> \<freemem\> \<freeswap\> \<Rate of memory usage indicating the usage compared to available swap space, implying system load on memory\>

### Explanation:
1. Normalized IO Intensity: By normalizing the io_intensity feature using the Z-score normalization, the feature's scale and effect are standardized, potentially leading to improved predictability and allowing the model to treat it with more significance.

2. Total System Calls: Summing up the sread and swrite features provides an overall measure of system call intensity. This can be helpful to capture the full extent of CPU activity influenced by system demands, allowing better estimation of CPU user mode time.

3. Memory Usage Rate: The memory_usage_rate feature is designed to provide insights into how effectively the available memory is being utilized as compared to the available swap space. This feature indicates the memory pressure on the system, which can have direct implications on CPU operations and hence can be a valuable predictor of CPU user mode time.

Explanation:
1. Memory Transfer Efficiency: This feature captures the efficiency of memory transfers by analyzing the ratio between lreads and lwrites. A higher ratio could highlight varying performance between reads and writes that may influence CPU user time, particularly if certain applications are read-heavy vs. write-heavy.
   
2. CPU Load Ratio: By calculating the ratio of the run queue size to the process load indicator, you gain a sense of how effectively the CPU is handling its current queue, potentially providing a clearer insight into CPU utilization for user processes.

3. System Memory Intensity: By adding freemem and freeswap, we're estimating the overall available system resources which may correlate with CPU's ability to maintain high user mode processing time, considering memory access has a direct impact on CPU performance and efficiency.

   Reasoning: The ratio of system calls to the process load indicator can give insight into periods where user mode processing is active, as higher system calls often correlate with increased user interactions.

2. <memory_transfer_frequency><plus><lread><lwrite><combined_rate_of_memory_transfers_between_system_and_user_memory>

   Reasoning: The sum of read and write operations between system and user memory may capture overall memory transfer activity, which can influence CPU operation intensity.

3. <system_activity_indicator><sum_of_squared><exec><fork><square_of_exec_and_fork_calls_peak_cpu_usage>

   Reasoning: Peak values in exec and fork system calls often indicate periods of high CPU utilization, particularly in user mode, so combining them and squaring can help emphasize these intensive moments.
