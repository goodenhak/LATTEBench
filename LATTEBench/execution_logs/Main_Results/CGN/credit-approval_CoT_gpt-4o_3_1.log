2025-09-02 00:46:06,081 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating additional features that could potentially improve the performance of the downstream model in predicting credit card application success:

1. <GenderEthnicity_cross_cross<Gender><Ethnicity>Combinesgenderandethnicityinformation>
   - Explanation: By crossing the Gender and Ethnicity features, this new categorical feature captures the combination of two demographic attributes, which may help the model capture distinct groups that have different likelihoods of credit card approval.

2. <DebtToIncomeRatio<ratio><Debt><Income>Thedebttoratiofeaturehighlightstherelationshipbetweenoutstandingdebtandincome>
   - Explanation: The DebtToIncomeRatio feature provides insights into the balance between a person's debt and income, a critical indicator of their financial health and capability to handle additional credit.

3. <EmployedYearsProduct<multiply><YearsEmployed><Employed>Combinationofyearsemployedandemploymentstatus>
   - Explanation: This feature multiplies the number of years employed by the employment status, capturing both the duration and the current state of employment. This may help discern the stability and consistency of the applicant's employment, which can be crucial for credit risk assessment.

2025-09-02 00:46:11,023 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <PriorDefault_Lag1><lag><PriorDefault><One-steplaggedvalueofPriorDefault>  
   Reasoning: Creating a lagged version of 'PriorDefault' can help capture any potential temporal dependencies or patterns in the data involving prior defaults.

2. <CreditIncomeRatio><divide><CreditScore><Income><RatiobetweenCreditScoreandIncome>
   Reasoning: The relationship between an individual's credit score and their income might be an informative feature when predicting the likelihood of successful credit card applications, as it can give insights into financial stability.

3. <Employment_Citizenship_Cross><cross><Employed><Citizen><CrossinteractionbetweenEmploymentStatusandCitizenship>
   Reasoning: Interacting ‘Employed’ with ‘Citizen’ could reveal patterns between employment status and citizenship status, which may influence the likelihood of being granted a credit card. This is especially relevant because different citizenship types might have different implications for credit risk perception by issuers.

   Reasoning: A high debt-to-income ratio may indicate financial strain and is often used in credit risk assessments. By creating this feature, you can help the model better understand an individual's financial stability.

2. <IncomeEthnicityInteraction><cross><Income><label_encode><Ethnicity><Interaction_between_Income_and_Ethnicity>

   Reasoning: Some ethnic groups might experience different financial behaviors or discrimination that could impact their income and credit applications. By crossing Income with Ethnicity, the model might capture these subtle interactions.

3. <AverageYearsEmployedPerIndustry><groupbythenmean><Industry><YearsEmployed><Calculate_average_years_employed_within_each_industry_to_understand_job_stability_as_per_profession>

   Reasoning: Different industries have different job stability metrics, and average years employed per industry can highlight these differences, which might influence creditworthiness.
