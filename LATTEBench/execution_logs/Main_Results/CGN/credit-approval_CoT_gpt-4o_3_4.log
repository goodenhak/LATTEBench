2025-09-20 16:11:36,692 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! To improve the predictions of successful credit card applications, it's essential to consider feature transformations that may uncover hidden patterns or relationships. Let's focus on generating new features that can aid the prediction model.

### Suggested Feature Engineering Steps:

1. Combine Employment and Income Related Information:
   - <employed_income_ratio><divide>Income<YearsEmployed><This feature captures the income per year of employment, which could indicate financial stability.>
   
2. Interaction Between Different Categorical Features:
   - <industry_ethnicity_cross><cross>Industry<Ethnicity><This interaction captures the combined effect of industry and ethnicity, revealing trends in credit card approvals specific to certain industry-ethnicity pairs.>
   
3. Capture Creditworthiness with Debt and Credit Score:
   - <debt_credit_score_ratio><ratio>Debt<CreditScore><This feature reveals the degree of debt relative to credit score, possibly highlighting creditworthiness or risk aversion.>

These new features are designed to emphasize potential predictors of credit card application success, considering economic behavior (employed_income_ratio), industry and ethnicity demographics (industry_ethnicity_cross), and financial responsibility (debt_credit_score_ratio). The information garnered from these newly engineered features may enhance the model's ability to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful applicants.

2. <YearsEmployedBankCustomerRatio<ratio<YearsEmployed<BankCustomer<Ratio_of_YearsEmployed_to_BankCustomer>  
   Reasoning: People who have been employed for a longer time and have a bank account might have a more stable financial background. This ratio can help differentiate those with higher financial stability.

3. <CitizenEncoded<label_encode<Citizen<Citizenship_Numerical_Encoding>  
   Reasoning: Encoding the categorical feature Citizenship to a numerical form may allow for better understanding and integration of this variable into any model training process, potentially increasing its predictive power.

2025-09-20 16:11:47,694 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<PriorDefault_YearsEmployed_interaction\>multiply\<PriorDefault\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Interaction between PriorDefault and YearsEmployed to capture combined influence\>  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the joint effect of having a prior default and the number of years employed, which may be a stronger indicator of credit card application success compared to evaluating these features independently.

2. \<Debt_to_Income_Ratio\>ratio\<Debt\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Ratio of Debt to Years Employed as a proxy for financial stability\>  
   Reasoning: This feature provides insight into financial stability, which may impact creditworthiness. A lower debt relative to employment duration could be indicative of better financial management.

3. \<Industry_Citizen_Interaction\>cross\<Industry\>\<Citizen\>\<Interaction between Industry and Citizenship status to capture sector-specific citizenship effects\>  
   Reasoning: Crossing Industry and Citizenship status can reveal if certain citizenship statuses in specific industries have higher chances of credit card approval, thus offering more nuanced insights.

2025-09-20 16:12:00,140 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps designed to improve the prediction of credit card application success:

1. Interaction between YearsEmployed and Employed status:
   - Rationale: Longer employment likely contributes more to the prediction for those who are currently employed. This feature captures the interaction between employment duration and employment status, emphasizing the difference between unemployed and employed applicants.
   - <EmployedYearsInteraction><multiply><YearsEmployed><Employed><InteractionbetweenYearsEmployedandEmploymentStatus>

2. Debt to Credit Score ratio:
   - Rationale: A high level of debt relative to credit score might indicate financial instability, which can be crucial in assessing creditworthiness. This feature may help to identify individuals with risky financial behavior.
   - <DebtCreditScoreRatio><divide><Debt><CreditScore><RatiobetweenDebtandCreditScore>

3. Industry and Citizen type interaction:
   - Rationale: Some industries might have different credit successes based on citizenship status (e.g., Temporary vs. By Birth). By creating this interaction feature, we can investigate if such combinations hold predictive power.

2. <Debt_Scaled><zscore><Debt><Zscore_scaled_Debt>
   - Reasoning: Standardizing the Debt feature using z-score can help the model differentiate more easily between different levels of outstanding debt by centering and scaling it, potentially making patterns related to credit card application success more apparent.

3. <Employed_BankCustomer_Interaction><cross><Employed><BankCustomer><Interaction between Employment_Status_and_Bank_Customer_Status>
   - Reasoning: By creating an interaction feature between being employed and having a bank account, we capture the combined effect of financial stability factor which might be influential in credit card application success.

2. <YearsEmployed_log_transform><log><YearsEmployed><Log_transformed_years_employed>
