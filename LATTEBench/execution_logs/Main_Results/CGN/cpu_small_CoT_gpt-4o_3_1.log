2025-10-15 00:52:35,751 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential features that could be generated to improve the downstream model's performance for predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode:

1. \<io_load_ratio\>\<divide\>\<lread\>\<lwrite\>\<Ratio_of_reads_to_writes_between_memory\>: 
   Developing a ratio of the read and write operations between system memory and user memory could capture the balance and intensity of I/O operations, which may correlate with CPU workload characteristics.

2. \<scall_per_fork\>\<divide\>\<scall\>\<fork\>\<System_calls_per_fork_operation\>: 
   Calculating the number of system calls per fork operation can give insights into how process management is handled under load, potentially affecting CPU utilization in user mode.

3. \<cpu_memory_pressure\>\<divide\>\<freemem\>\<runqsz\>\<Memory_available_per_process_in_run_queue\>: 
   This feature represents the available memory related to the process queue size, providing a measure of system pressure, which can affect CPU time allocation.

These new features aim to capture complex interactions and load characteristics within the system, which may relate to how much time the CPU spends in user mode.

   Reasoning: This feature provides additional insight into the balance between memory reads and writes at a lower level. A high ratio might indicate more user-centric operations as opposed to system writes.

2. \<sread_swrite_diff\> \<subtract\> \<sread\> \<swrite\> \<Difference_between_system_read_and_write_calls\>

   Reasoning: The difference between system read and write calls can provide information on whether user-mode operations are more read-intensive or write-intensive, which can be indicative of the types of tasks being run.

3. \<fork_exec_product\> \<multiply\> \<fork\> \<exec\> \<Product_of_fork_and_exec_calls\>

   Reasoning: The product of fork and exec calls can be an indicator of the overall multitasking and overhead undertaken by the CPU, which can correlate with the CPU's time spent in user mode due to increased process handling.

   - Reasoning: The ratio between characters read and written could give insights into data transfer patterns, which might have a strong relationship with CPU time in user mode as different tasks could lead to varying read/write load.

2. <scall_rate><divide><scall><runqsz><System_calls_per_process_in_run_queue>
   - Reasoning: By examining the rate of system calls per process in the run queue, we can gauge the load on the CPU and task distribution, which might affect how much time the CPU spends running in user mode.

3. <mem_pressure><subtract><freemem><lread><Memory_pressure_based_on_available_memory_and_memory_reads>
   - Reasoning: Subtracting the reads from free memory might highlight situations of high memory demand, possibly impacting CPU operations in user mode if frequent memory accesses are needed for active tasks.

2025-10-15 00:54:51,442 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps to generate new features using the given operators:

1. <lread_log><log><lread><Log_transformation_of_lread_to_handle_skewness>
   - Reasoning: The lread feature has a mean significantly higher than its median, indicating it might be right-skewed. Applying a log transformation can help normalize this distribution, potentially improving the model's ability to learn patterns more effectively.

2. <cpu_intensity><divide><sread><runqsz><Ratio_of_system_reads_to_process_queue_size>
   - Reasoning: By creating a ratio of sread (system read calls) to runqsz (process run queue size), we can capture the CPU intensity relative to the number of processes waiting to execute, which might give insight into CPU load balancing and, consequently, user mode CPU time.

3. <memory_pressure><divide><freemem><freeswap><Ratio_of_free_memory_to_free_swap_space_as_a_measure_of_memory_pressure>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of freemem to freeswap provides a measure of memory pressure. A higher ratio could indicate that the system is relying more on available memory than swap space, which might impact CPU operations and is relevant for predicting the portion of time CPUs run in user mode.
