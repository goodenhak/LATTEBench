   Reasoning: Squaring the SpMax_L values can capture non-linear relationships between this feature and the target variable. The leading eigenvalue might exhibit quadratic relationships, which aren't captured by using the feature as is.

2. <Cb_over_C_N_ratio><ratio><nCb->F04[C-N]><Ratio_of_substituted_benzene_C_to_topological_C-N>
   
   Reasoning: Creating a ratio between nCb- and F04[C-N] can represent the proportion of substituted benzene carbon atoms to C-N formations at topological distance 4. This ratio might help in capturing the structural characteristics influencing biodegradability.

3. <SdO_zscore><zscore><SdO><Z_score_normalization_of_SdO>
   
   Reasoning: Applying z-score normalization to SdO can help standardize the feature, making it easier for downstream models to assess its impact independently of scale. This measure might be critical in assessing electronic state characteristics related to biodegradability.

   - Reasoning: The ratio of carbon to oxygen atoms can reflect the chemical composition and potentially affect biodegradability. A higher carbon concentration compared to oxygen might suggest different stability or reactivity properties.

2. <spmax_l_j_dz_sqroot><sqrt><SpMax_L><J_Dz(e)><Sqrt_of_product_of_spmax_l_and_j_dz>  
   - Reasoning: Combining spectral properties, such as the Leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) and the Balaban-like index (J_Dz(e)), might reveal deeper structural characteristics related to chemical bonding and geometry which are crucial for biodegradability assessment.

3. <oxygen_heavy_atom_ratio><ratio><nO><nHM><Ratio_of_oxygen_atoms_to_heavy_atoms>  
   - Reasoning: The proportion of oxygen atoms to heavy atoms could be indicative of the compound’s chemical makeup and reactivity. This ratio can influence properties like solubility and polarity, affecting biodegradability.

2025-09-02 00:32:21,974 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps to enhance the performance of the downstream model, each accompanied by a rationale:

1. <SpMax_L_normalized><zscore><SpMax_L><Z-score normalized leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix>
   - Rationale: Normalizing the SpMax_L using Z-score will standardize this feature, making it easier for the model to learn and handle variance across samples, especially if the model is sensitive to scale.

2. <HeavyAtomsEffect><multiply><nHM><SpMax_B(m)><Interaction effect between number of heavy atoms and leading eigenvalue from Burden matrix>
   - Rationale: Investigating the interaction between the number of heavy atoms and the leading eigenvalue from the Burden matrix can reveal complex patterns related to the chemical structure, potentially capturing important nuances associated with chemical stability or reactivity.

3. <OxygenPresence><plus><nO><nHDon><Combined presence of oxygen atoms and hydrogen bond donor atoms>
   - Rationale: The combination of the number of oxygen atoms and the number of donor atoms for H-bonds might give insight into the polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding of the molecule, which are important factors in determining biodegradability.

   - This feature captures the relative abundance of oxygen atoms compared to nitrogen atoms. Since the presence and balance of oxygen and nitrogen can affect biodegradability, this ratio might reveal important chemical relationships.

2. \<SpMax_L_Me_interaction\>multiply\<SpMax_L\>\<Me\>\<Interaction_term_between_SpMax_L_and_Me\>  
   - Interaction terms between molecular descriptors such as SpMax_L and electronegativity (Me) may better capture their joint effects on the chemical structure, potentially improving the classification of biodegradability.

3. \<Topological_C_O_N_Frequency\>plus\<F02[C-N\]\>\<F03[C-O\]\>\<Combined_frequency_of_C-N_and_C-O_at_topological_distances\>

   Reasoning: Applying a square root transformation can help stabilize variance and make data more normally distributed, potentially improving model performance.

2. <Heavy_C_ratio><ratio><nHM><C%><Ratio_of_Heavy_Atoms_to_Percentage_of_C_Atoms>
   Reasoning: The ratio of heavy atoms to the percentage of carbon atoms can capture the density of heavy atoms in relation to carbon, possibly indicating structural characteristics related to biodegradability.

3. <SpMax_B(m)_zscore><zscore><SpMax_B(m)><Z-Score_Transformation_of_Leading_Eigenvalue_from_Burden_Matrix_Weighted_by_Mass>
   Reasoning: Applying a z-score transformation standardizes the feature, which can help in improving model robustness by making different features comparable.

   *Reasoning:* Biodegradability can be influenced by the ratio of carbon and oxygen in molecules. This feature captures the balance between carbon and oxygen which is often crucial for biodegradation processes.

2. <SpMax_L_zscore><zscore><SpMax_L><Z_score_normalization_of_SpMax_L>  
   *Reasoning:* Normalizing features can often lead to better model performance, especially if some algorithms assume normalized input data. Z-score normalization specifically will center the data and scale with standard deviation, which helps in understanding outliers or extreme values present in <SpMax_L>.

3. <high_C_N_interaction><greater><F04[C-N]><3><Binary_feature_for_significant_C_N_interactions_at_distance_4>  
   *Reasoning:* Creating a binary feature to indicate high interactions at a particular structural distance can be useful. Chemical bonds at specific distances might signify structural features relevant to biodegradability, making this feature a potential discriminator for the class labels.
