   - By calculating the ratio of age to debt, we can identify individuals who might be financially stable (higher ratio) versus those under financial strain (lower ratio). Financial stability can be an important factor in credit card applications.

2. \<employed_income_interaction\>\<multiply\>\<Employed\>\<Income\>\<Interaction_of_employment_status_and_income\>  
   - This feature captures the interaction between employment status and income, providing insights into the earning potential while taking employment into account. This could help distinguish between employed individuals with varying income levels and those unemployed, impacting credit card application success.

3. \<industry_prior_default_interaction\>\<cross\>\<Industry\>\<PriorDefault\>\<Interaction_between_industry_and_prior_defaults\>  
   - By crossing 'Industry' with 'PriorDefault', we can observe patterns where certain industries are more prone to prior defaults. This interaction could indicate risk profiles relevant for credit card application success.

   - Reasoning: This feature captures whether specific gender-age combinations have different success rates in applying for a credit card, which could be meaningful in demographic-focused financial analytics.

2. \<employment_license_ratio\> \<ratio\> \<Employed\> \<DriversLicense\> \<Ratio\_of\_employment\_to\_having\_a\_drivers\_license\>  
   - Reasoning: Employment status and having a driver's license might correlate differently with credit card application success, depending on lifestyle or mobility. This ratio may identify people who are less mobile but employed, affecting their success rate.

3. \<income_credit_score_interaction\> \<multiply\> \<Income\> \<CreditScore\> \<Interaction\_of\_income\_and\_credit\_score\>  
   - Reasoning: The interaction of income with credit score might highlight how well individuals manage their income versus their ability to maintain a credit score, providing insight into financial discipline affecting application success.

2025-09-02 00:50:48,925 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <gender_credit_interaction><cross><Gender><CreditScore><interaction_of_gender_and_credit_score>  
   
   Reasoning: Gender and credit score might have an interactive effect on the likelihood of a successful credit card application. This interaction feature could help capture this relationship.

2. <income_log><log><Income><log_transformed_income>  

   Reasoning: Income is highly skewed and log transformation can help normalize it, making it easier for the model to learn patterns associated with income and the success of credit card applications.

3. <employed_income_ratio><ratio><employed_income_interaction><Income><ratio_of_employment_income_to_total_income>  

   Reasoning: Understanding the ratio of income from employment relative to total income might provide insights into the financial stability of an individual, which could be beneficial for predicting credit card application success.

2025-09-02 00:51:04,624 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <scaled_age><zscore><Age><standardized_age_feature>  
   Standardizing the Age feature can help the model learn patterns more effectively by centering the data and giving it unit variance. This makes it easier for the model to converge by ensuring that age-related contributions to predictions are independent of other similarly scaled features.

2. <income_marital_interaction><cross><Income><Married><interaction_between_income_and_marital_status>  
   Creating an interaction feature between Income and Married can capture the combined impact of marital status on income, which could be an important factor in determining credit card approval as marital status often influences financial stability or income management.

3. <employment_status_permanency><cross><Employed><Citizen><interaction_between_employment_and_citizenship>  
   Cross the Employed status with the Citizen feature to capture dynamics related to job stability and permanency of stay in the country. Those employed and having permanent citizenship might have a different credit profile compared to temporary citizens, influencing creditworthiness.
