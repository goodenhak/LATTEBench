   Reasoning: By evaluating the balance of income after making installment commitments on credit, we can create a feature that captures the applicant’s remaining financial capability, which might influence their creditworthiness.

2. \<credit_age_ratio\divide\credit_amount\age\Ratio_of_credit_amount_to_applicant’s_age;_indicates_the_weight_of_the_financial_burden_based_on_age\>

   Reasoning: The credit amount compared to the individual's age may provide insight into whether they are taking on an appropriate level of financial risk for their stage in life. This can give perspective on whether younger applicants are making proportionate credit requests, which might affect loan acceptance decisions.

3. \<job_residence_stability\cross\job\residence_since\Indicates_stability_of_employment_and_residence_combined_same_category\>

   Reasoning: Combining job type with years at the current residence could provide an indication of overall stability and reliability, giving foresight into whether an applicant is steady in both employment and housing, factors which might affect credit approval.

   Reasoning: This feature calculates the importance of the credit history in relation to the loan duration, which could help in identifying applicants with significant credit history issues over longer durations.

2. \<savings_employment_level\><cross><savings_status><employment\><Combines savings status and employment duration to evaluate financial stability>
   
   Reasoning: By combining savings status and employment duration, we can better assess the applicant's financial stability. Individuals with significant savings and long-term employment are typically more creditworthy.

3. \<age_loan_intensity\><ratio><credit_amount><age\><Measures loan intensity concerning the applicant's age, which might highlight younger applicants with high loan demands>
   
   Reasoning: This feature evaluates the credit amount in relation to the applicant's age, potentially identifying younger individuals who demand relatively large loans. This can help in assessing risk associated with less experienced applicants requesting significant credit.

2025-09-01 23:49:25,635 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<employment_encoded\><label_encode><employment\><Encoded_numerical_representation_of_employment_status\>  
   Reasoning: Encoding the employment status into a numerical representation can provide insights into the applicant's creditworthiness, as different employment durations might impact the credit scoring.

2. \<duration_per_existing_credit\><divide><duration><existing_credits\><Ratio_of_duration_to_existing_credits_for_better_assessment_of_credit_exposure\>  
   Reasoning: Calculating the ratio of the credit duration to the number of existing credits can reveal how long the applicant will be tied to the loans, relative to their existing financial commitments.

3. \<credit_to_income_ratio\><divide><credit_amount><installment_commitment\><Assessment_of_the_loan_burden_relative_to_monthly_installment_rate\>  
   Reasoning: This feature calculates how large the credit amount is compared to the installment commitment, which may indicate if the borrowing amount is justifiable and viable within the person's committed disposable income.
