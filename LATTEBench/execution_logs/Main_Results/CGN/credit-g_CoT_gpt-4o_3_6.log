3. \<credit_history_status_bin\> \<bin\> \<credit_history\> \<Binned_credit_history_status\>

Reasoning:
1. credit_to_duration_ratio: Calculating the ratio of the credit amount to the duration can provide insights into the burden or risk associated with the credit compared to the expected repayment period. Higher ratios could pinpoint riskier profiles, helping in better distinguishment between credit-worthy and non-credit-worthy applicants.

2. employment_duration_encoded: Encoding employment as a numerical feature can help quantify the employment status with respect to tenure. Longer employment durations often reflect stability, which is beneficial in predicting whether a person will receive credit. This transformation is expected to make employment comparisons more straightforward.

3. credit_history_status_bin: Binning credit history can simplify the categories into more manageable groups. By grouping similar statuses, the model may better capture patterns in credit approval, reducing the complexity and dimensionality of categorical credit histories.

2025-09-20 14:53:12,978 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential steps for feature engineering to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <employment_credit_interaction><cross><employment><credit_history><Combined influence of employment duration and credit history on credit approval decision>
   
   Reasoning: Employment duration and credit history are critical factors in credit approval decisions. By creating a cross feature of these two variables, we encapsulate complex interactions that may influence whether a person receives credit or not.

2. <credit_amount_scaled><zscore><credit_amount><Standardized credit amount to remove mean and scale by standard deviation>
   
   Reasoning: Standardizing the credit amount can help the model to better handle different scales and distributions of the credit amounts, potentially improving the model's performance by focusing on relative, rather than absolute, credit values.

3. <age_duration_interaction><ratio><age><duration><Interaction of age and credit duration to assess maturity relative to loan length>

   Reasoning: This feature directly assesses the applicant’s age concerning the duration of the credit, which may offer insights into the maturity and potential risk associated with granting credit. It allows the model to understand whether younger or older applicants are receiving longer or shorter credit durations relative to their age.
