1. <day_cos><cosine><day><Cosine_transformation_of_day_feature>
   - Reasoning: Applying a cosine transformation to the 'day' feature can help capture cyclical patterns throughout the week, potentially identifying if there is a difference in electricity price behavior based on the day of the week.

2. <nswprice_rolling_mean_24h><rolling_mean><nswprice><period_48><24hour_rolling_mean_of_nswprice>
   - Reasoning: Calculating a 24-hour rolling mean of the 'nswprice' feature can help smooth out short-term fluctuations and emphasize longer-term trends, which may be influential in predicting next-day price changes.

3. <nswprice_vs_vicprice_ratio><ratio><nswprice><vicprice><Ratio_of_NSW_price_to_VIC_price>
   - Reasoning: The ratio between NSW and Victorian electricity prices could be valuable, as it might capture shifts in market conditions or demand that reflect broader price dynamics between the two regions.

2025-10-13 16:29:22,342 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three potential feature engineering steps designed to enhance the downstream model's performance:

1. <nswprice_rolling_mean_24h><rolling_mean><nswprice><period=48><24-hour_rolling_mean_of_NSW_price>
   - Reasoning: This feature calculates the 24-hour rolling mean of the NSW electricity price, which directly aligns with the label describing the price change relative to a moving average. This could help in identifying anomalies or swift changes in price beyond typical daily fluctuations.

2. <nsw_vic_demand_ratio><ratio><nswdemand><vicdemand><NSW_to_VIC_demand_ratio>
   - Reasoning: This feature computes the ratio of electricity demand between New South Wales and Victoria. It can help to understand the relative demand pressures in both states and whether these influence the price changes. Markets with differing demand levels may affect price trends.

3. <weekday><bin><day><is_weekday><Weekday_vs_Weekend_marker>
   - Reasoning: This feature distinguishes weekdays from weekends, capturing potential differences in demand patterns and pricing caused by daily usage behavior. Electricity prices might exhibit different patterns based on typical working hours versus weekend relaxation periods.

2025-10-13 16:29:48,447 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate features that could potentially improve the model's performance:

1. \<weekend\>\<is_weekend\>\<day\>\<BinaryFeatureIndicatingIfDayIsWeekend\>  
   Reasoning: Whether a day is a weekend or not may have an impact on electricity demand and prices. By introducing a binary feature that indicates weekends, we capture different behavioral patterns between weekdays and weekends.

2. \<price_demand_ratio\>\<ratio\>\<nswprice\>\<nswdemand\>\<RatioOfNSWPriceToNSWDemand\>  
   Reasoning: The relationship between price and demand can provide insights into market conditions. The ratio of price to demand could highlight periods of high price volatility or unusual market behavior.

3. \<mean_vicprice_by_day\>\<groupbythenmean\>\<day\>\<vicprice\>\<MeanVicPriceGroupedByDayOfWeek\>  
   Reasoning: Understanding weekly patterns in Victoria's electricity prices could help in contextualizing NSW prices. This feature helps to capture if certain days of the week consistently have higher or lower electricity prices in Victoria, which may influence NSW dynamics.

2025-10-13 16:30:10,480 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three potential feature engineering steps:

1. <day_period_interaction><cross><day><period><Interaction_of_day_and_period_to_capture_time-based_patterns>
   - *Reasoning:* Capturing interactions between 'day' and 'period' might help in identifying patterns related to specific times and days. These interactions can capture potential cyclical patterns that influence the price changes.

2. <nswdemand_lag1><lag><nswdemand><Lag_of_1_period_in_nswdemand_for_trend_analysis>
   - *Reasoning:* Introducing a lag feature helps understand the immediate past trend. A one period lag on 'nswdemand' might reveal the immediate change in demand which could correlate with price changes.

3. <price_demand_ratio><divide><nswprice><nswdemand><Ratio_of_price_to_demand_in_NSW_as_a_supply_demand_balance_indicator>
   - *Reasoning:* The ratio of price to demand can provide insight into supply-demand dynamics. If the price is high relative to demand or vice-versa, it could indicate periods of imbalance, potentially predicting price movement relative to a moving average.

2. <lag_nswprice><lag><nswprice><Lag_of_nswprice_for_period_3>

2025-10-13 16:31:40,483 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<nswprice_ma24\>rolling_mean\<nswprice,date,period\>\<24_hour_moving_average_of_nswprice\>
   - Reasoning: Creating a 24-hour moving average of the nswprice will directly provide the needed reference for calculating the change relative to this moving average. This feature will help in determining if the price is UP or DOWN with respect to the recent trend, which is crucial for labeling the target variable.

2. \<vicprice_median_by_day\>groupbythenmedian\<day,vicprice\>\<median_vicprice_per_day_of_week\>
   - Reasoning: By calculating the median vicprice for each day of the week, we can capture regular pricing patterns within days, which might correlate with changes in the nswprice. This feature can help understand and anticipate relative price movements due to typical weekly cycles.

3. \<transfer_demand_ratio_zscore\>zscore\<transfer_demand_ratio\>\<zscore_normalized_transfer_demand_ratio\>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the transfer_demand_ratio with z-score transformation can help detect outliers and significant fluctuations in electricity transfer relative to demand. Identifying significant shifts in this ratio might correlate with spikes or drops in electricity price in New South Wales, impacting the pricing model's predictions.

Explanation:

1. <weekday_vs_weekend_trend><groupbythenmean><is_weekend><nswprice><Average_NSW_price_based_on_weekend_or_weekday>: 
   This feature calculates the average New South Wales price based on whether it's a weekday or a weekend. This could help capture price variations due to different demand and supply dynamics on weekdays versus weekends.

2. <price_demand_ratio><ratio><nswprice><nswdemand><Ratio_of_NSW_price_to_NSW_demand>: 
   This feature creates a ratio of the NSW price to NSW demand. This ratio could be indicative of price spikes relative to demand changes, helping to capture the pressure on prices due to demand.

3. <vic_transfer_impact><multiply><vicprice><transfer><Impact_of_Victoria_price_on_electricity_transfer>: 
   This feature examines the interaction effect between the Victoria price and the electricity transfer. It could reveal how price changes in Victoria could influence electricity transfer dynamics between Victoria and New South Wales, which may subsequently affect NSW prices.

   Reasoning: The task specifically involves predicting price changes relative to a moving average. Thus, calculating the difference between the current price and the 24-hour rolling average will help capture short-term fluctuations around the trend.

2. <price_ratio_to_vic><ratio><nswprice><vicprice><Ratio_of_NSW_price_to_Victoria_price>
   Reasoning: This ratio will help in understanding the relative pricing of electricity between New South Wales and Victoria. Significant deviations might indicate regional pricing pressures, which could be relevant for predicting the price change label.

3. <weekday_period_cross><cross><day><period><Crossed_feature_of_day_and_period>
   Reasoning: Crossing the day and period allows capturing daily and hourly patterns in electricity prices that might influence the prediction of price trends. This feature will help understand patterns specific to certain days and times.

   Reasoning: By examining the change in Victoria's electricity price relative to the previous period, we can gauge short-term market fluctuations that may influence New South Wales's price, thus potentially improving the prediction model.

2. <nsw_vic_price_ratio<ratio<nswprice<vicprice<Ratio_of_NSW_to_VIC_price>

   Reasoning: Creating a ratio of the New South Wales to Victoria electricity prices can reveal relative price differences. This feature might capture inter-state pricing dynamics that influence price changes in New South Wales.

3. <mean_24h_nswprice<rolling_mean<nswprice<24<Mean_of_nswprice_over_last_24_hours>

   Reasoning: This feature captures recent trends in the NSW price over a 24-hour window, smoothing out variability and potentially highlighting deviations that could signal an upcoming change.
