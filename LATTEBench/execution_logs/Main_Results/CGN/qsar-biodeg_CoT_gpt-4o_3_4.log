2025-09-20 15:43:47,678 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <SpMax_L_Cube><cube><SpMax_L><Cubed leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix>
   
   Reasoning: The SpMax_L feature represents the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix, indicating certain aspects of the molecular graph's structure. By cubing it, we may emphasize more significant variations or amplify particular patterns that could aid in distinguishing biodegradable substances.

2. <HeavyAtomPresence><greater><nHM>1><Binary indicator if the number of heavy atoms is greater than 1>

   Reasoning: Identifying the presence of heavy atoms can be crucial, as it might correlate with the environmental impact or the biodegradability of chemicals. Creating a binary feature helps the model distinguish readings that contain any heavy atoms from those that do not, which could be instrumental in classification.

3. <CN_Interaction_Sqrt><sqrt><F04[C-N]><Square root of frequency of C-N interactions at topological distance 4>

   Reasoning: The interaction frequency between carbon and nitrogen is relevant to molecular structure and function. Taking the square root may linearize the relationship or reduce skewness in this feature, making it more effective for pattern recognition in the model.

2025-09-20 15:44:10,212 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<normalized_nO_RATIO_nHM\><zscore><nO_RATIO_nHM>\<Z-score_normalization_of_nO_RATIO_nHM_to_handle_extreme_values\>  
   - Reasoning: The attribute nO_RATIO_nHM has a very large range and a high standard deviation, which indicates extreme variation in its values. Z-score normalization can help handle these extreme values and make the feature scale more comparable to others, improving model convergence.

2. \<F03_C_O_and_F03_C_N_ratio\><ratio><F03[C-O]><F03[C-N]>\<Ratio_of_Frequency_of_C-O_to_C-N_at_topological_distance_3\>  
   - Reasoning: Both F03[C-O] and F03[C-N] represent the frequency of chemical bonds at a particular topological distance. Calculating their ratio can help capture the balance between these interactions and potentially reveal important information pertinent to molecular properties and biodegradability.

3. \<interaction_SpMax_L_and_SpMax_A\><multiply><SpMax_L><SpMax_A>\<Interaction_between_leading_eigenvalues_from_Laplace_and_adjacency_matrices\>  
   - Reasoning: By capturing the product of SpMax_L and SpMax_A, we examine the interaction effects between spectral properties from different matrix representations of molecular structures. This can uncover complex nonlinear relationships contributing to classification.

These steps aim to further enrich the dataset with features potentially containing non-linear interactions and normalized scales for existing varied features, which can be valuable for improving the performance of a downstream classification model.

2025-09-20 15:44:20,701 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 3732, 'completion_tokens': 288, 'total_tokens': 4020}
2025-09-20 15:44:20,701 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nN_Sqrt><sqrt><nN><Square_root_of_the_number_of_Nitrogen_atoms_to_manage_skewness_and_promote_feature_scaling>
   - Reasoning: Applying a square root transformation can help reduce skewness in the 'nN' distribution, which has a small range and potential skewness due to a predominance of zero values. This can improve the model's ability to learn relationships involving nitrogen atoms.

2. <nHM_to_SpMax_L_Ratio><ratio><nHM><SpMax_L><Ratio_of_number_of_heavy_atoms_to_Leading_eigenvalue_from_Laplace_matrix>
   - Reasoning: This feature encapsulates the balance between the molecular size (represented by 'nHM') and structural complexity (represented by 'SpMax_L'). It could be an important indicator of how these molecular characteristics interplay in biodegradability.

3. <Polarizability_PSIi_product><multiply><SpPosA_B(p)><Psi_i_A><Product_of_spectral_positive_sum_weighted_by_polarizability_and_intrinsic_state_pseudoconnectivity_index>
   - Reasoning: By multiplying the 'SpPosA_B(p)' and 'Psi_i_A', this feature captures the combined effect of polarity-derived measures with intrinsic connectivity states. This may highlight interactions sensitive to both molecular polarizability and structure, potentially important in biodegradability prediction.

2025-09-20 15:44:34,919 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <nO_SdO_ratio><divide><SdO><nO_RATIO_nHM><Ratio_of_SdO_to_nO_RATIO_nHM_to_examine_correlation_with_molecular_complexity>
   - Reasoning: By analyzing the ratio of the sum of dO E-states (SdO) to the ratio of oxygen to heavy atoms (nO_RATIO_nHM), it could reveal underlying relationships in the balance of molecular complexity that may influence biodegradability.

2. <SM6_Bm_HyWi_Bm_product><multiply><SM6_B(m)><HyWi_B(m)><Product_of_SM6_B_m_and_HyWi_B_m_as_Spectral_index_combination>
   - Reasoning: The product of spectral indices from the Burden matrix, weighted by mass (SM6_B(m)) and from the Hyper-Wiener-like index (HyWi_B(m)), might capture complex structural features in molecules that are impactful for classification.

3. <SpMax_L_LOC_sum><plus><SpMax_L><LOC><Sum_of_SpMax_L_and_LOC_for_combined_structure_index>
   - Reasoning: Adding the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) and the Lopping centric index (LOC) may provide a combined measure of molecular compactness and branching efficiency, potentially improving the model's understanding of structural properties relevant to biodegradability.
