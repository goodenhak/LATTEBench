   - Reasoning: Min-max normalization on the AgeDebtRatio will help scale the feature to a consistent range, which can accentuate differences in financial responsibility compared to age, and may be useful for assessing risk levels during credit card applications.

2. <Interaction_Income_CreditScore><multiply><Income><CreditScore><interaction_feature_of_income_and_credit_score_to_assess_financial_stability>
   
   - Reasoning: By multiplying Income and CreditScore, we can assess a combined financial stability measure to better predict credit card application success.

3. <Industry_financial_exposure><cross><Industry><Income_and_CreditScore><crossed_feature_of_industry_and_income_and_credit_score_for_financial_health_in_different_sectors>
   
   - Reasoning: A cross feature between Industry and Income_and_CreditScore can provide insights into how financial stability varies across different job sectors, potentially improving prediction accuracy for credit card approvals.
