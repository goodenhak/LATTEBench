3. \<normalized_duration\><minmax><duration><Normalized duration to scale feature values between 0 and 1 for model stability\>  

Explanation:

1. Numerical Encoding of checking_status: The checking_status feature is an ordinal categorical variable indicating the status of the applicant's checking account. By applying label_encode, we can transform this categorical feature into a numerical one, preserving the inherent order of the categories. This transformation enables the model to learn the relationship between different stages of financial stability and credit decision outcomes.

2. Cross Feature of savings_status and employment: By creating a cross feature between savings_status and employment, we capture potential interactions between the applicant’s savings level and their employment status. For instance, an individual with substantial savings and stable employment might be viewed more favorably compared to one lacking savings with sporadic employment, affecting their creditworthiness.

3. Normalization of duration: The duration feature is essential in assessing credit risk as longer durations could imply increased risk. Normalizing this feature through minmax scaling ensures it is scaled consistently between 0 and 1, reducing biases due to differing scales across features. Standardizing the scale aids the model in making more balanced predictions and increases its convergence speed during training.

2025-09-20 14:51:18,772 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible steps for generating new features using the available operations, with the aim of enhancing our prediction model for credit approval:

1. <employment_duration_ratio><ratio><employment><duration><Captures_the_ratio_between_employment_duration_and_credit_duration_to_understand_stability_in_repayment_ability>
    - Reasoning: The ratio between employment status (which is encoded to represent years in employment) and credit duration can help assess the applicant's long-term financial stability and reliability in repaying credit over time.

2. <age_installment_product><multiply><age><installment_commitment><Creates_a_feature_to_explore_the_relationship_between_age_and_installment_commitment_for_risk_assessment>
    - Reasoning: Multiplying age and installment commitment can reveal underlying patterns in risk associated with age-related financial behavior and repayment burdens. Older applicants may have different financial management compared to younger applicants with similar installment commitments.

3. <credit_per_residence_year><divide><credit_amount><residence_since><Calculates_the_credit_amount_given_per_year_of_residence_to_analyze_stability_and_potential_overextension_in_credit_taking>
    - Reasoning: Dividing credit amount by years of residence can highlight the extent of credit taken relative to stability in living situation. Long-term residence coupled with high credit might indicate strong creditworthiness, whereas low residence with high credit could suggest potential overextension.
