   - Reasoning: \(SdO\) measures the contribution of oxygen, which might impact biodegradability. By creating a ratio with the mean \(SdO\), we normalize the feature, potentially highlighting anomalous values that could be important for classification.

2. \<nHDon_log\> \<log\> \<nHDon\> \<Log-transformation of number of donor atoms for H-bonds\>
   - Reasoning: \(nHDon\) can be skewed towards lower values, and applying a log-transformation can help stabilize variance and render patterns more evident, potentially aiding classification models.

3. \<Psi_i_A_by_J_Dz\> \<divide\> \<Psi_i_A\> \<J_Dz(e)\> \<Ratio of intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index to Balaban-like index\>
   - Reasoning: This ratio could capture a balance between pseudoconnectivity and molecular shape descriptors, potentially highlighting compounds whose connectivity indices are atypically proportional to their molecular shape and energy distribution.

2025-09-02 00:29:47,960 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps for feature engineering that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance:

1. <heavy_atoms_sqrt_ratio><sqrt><heavy_atoms_percentage_ratio><Square_root_of_heavy_atoms_percentage_ratio_to_reduce_non_linearity>
   - Reasoning: Applying a square root transformation on heavy_atoms_percentage_ratio could reduce non-linearity and help make this feature more expressive, as it might highlight smaller quantities of heavy atoms relative to carbon atoms in a more balanced manner.

2. <SpMax_B_m_log><log><SpMax_B_m><Log_transformation_of_SpMax_B_m_to_handle_skewness>
   - Reasoning: Logarithmic transformation can be useful in handling skewness and stabilizing variance, potentially leading to better model performance by allowing the feature SpMax_B(m) to fit into the model assumptions.

3. <C_percentage_cosine><cosine><C%><Cosine_transformation_of_C_percentage_to_capture_cyclic_patterns>
   - Reasoning: Using cosine transformation on C% can help capture potential cyclic patterns or regularities related to carbon percentage, as the distribution can often show cyclical behaviors in chemical data.

Reasoning:

1. C_O_ratio_frequency_ratio: This feature computes the ratio of the frequencies of C-O to C-N bonds at specific topological distances. This can capture the relative abundance of these bonds in a molecule, which might differentiate the biodegradability class, as certain compositions might favor readiness for biodegradation.

2. log_HeavyAtoms_CPercentage_ratio: Applying a log transformation to this ratio might reduce skewness and capture multiplicative relationships in the data, potentially improving model performance in identifying patterns relative to biodegradability.

3. zscore_SM6_L_J_Dz_e_sum: By normalizing the log-transformed spectral moment and electronegativity index sum with a Z-score, we can emphasize outliers and mitigate the influence of extreme values. This can be useful in improving sensitivity to features that contribute substantially beyond typical variation, fostering better insights for classification purposes.

2025-09-02 00:30:24,937 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Oxygen_Nitrogen_Ratio><divide><nO><nN><Ratio_of_Oxygen_to_Nitrogen_Atoms>
   - Reasoning: Understanding the balance between oxygen and nitrogen could help capture molecular features relevant for biodegradability, as both elements play crucial roles in chemical structures and reactions.

2. <SpMaxL_SpMaxB_ratio><divide><SpMax_L><SpMax_B(m)><Ratio_of_Leading_Eigenvalues_from_Laplace_and_Burden_Matrices>
   - Reasoning: Capturing the relationship between different eigenvalues might highlight structural nuances that affect biodegradability. This ratio can offer insights into molecular connectivity and mass distribution.

3. <SdO_SdssC_sum><plus><SdO><SdssC><Sum_of_SdO_and_SdssC_Estates>
   - Reasoning: Aggregating different E-state sums could emphasize cumulative electronic states, which are significant in chemical reactivity and stability, potentially impacting the biodegradability classification.
