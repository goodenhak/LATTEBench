# COMPACTNESS_SQRT
import numpy as np
df['COMPACTNESS_SQRT'] = np.sqrt(df['COMPACTNESS'])
# Feature description: The square root of the COMPACTNESS feature.
# Usefulness: Computing the square root can help to reduce skewness and manage the presence of outliers in the data. It can make the feature distribution more normal-like and thus may improve model performance.

end

python
# CIRCULARITY_LOG
df['CIRCULARITY_LOG'] = np.log(df['CIRCULARITY'] + 1)
# Feature description: The logarithm of CIRCULARITY (with a small constant added to handle zero values).
# Usefulness: Log transformation can help in stabilizing variance and normalizing the distribution of features, which can be particularly useful for features like CIRCULARITY that might have a skewed distribution.

end

python
# RADIUS_RATIO_NORMALIZED
df['RADIUS_RATIO_NORMALIZED'] = (df['RADIUS_RATIO'] - df['RADIUS_RATIO'].mean()) / df['RADIUS_RATIO'].std()
# Feature description: Normalized RADIUS_RATIO using z-score normalization.
# Usefulness: Z-score normalization enables features with large values to be more comparable with features of smaller scales, aiding the interpretation of RADIUS_RATIO in context with other features.

end

python
# ASPECT_RATIO_DIFFERENCE
df['ASPECT_RATIO_DIFFERENCE'] = df['PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO'] - df['MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO']
# Feature description: The difference between primary axis aspect ratio and maximum length aspect ratio.
# Usefulness: This difference can reveal how asymmetric a vehicle silhouette is, which may help in distinguishing between different vehicle types based on their symmetry properties.

end

python
# ELONGATEDNESS_RECIPROCAL
df['ELONGATEDNESS_RECIPROCAL'] = 1 / df['ELONGATEDNESS']
# Feature description: Reciprocal of ELONGATEDNESS.
# Usefulness: Reciprocal transformation can handle values in ways that mirror the original feature, enhancing sensitivity to smaller values and sometimes stabilizing variance.

end

python
# SCATTER_RATIO_EXP
df['SCATTER_RATIO_EXP'] = np.exp(df['SCATTER_RATIO'])
# Feature description: Exponential transformation of SCATTER_RATIO.
# Usefulness: By computing the exponential, this captures the exponential growth or sensitivity in scattering, which might be pivotal in distinguishing vehicle silhouettes.

end

python
# REGULARITY_COMPACTNESS_RATIO
df['REGULARITY_COMPACTNESS_RATIO'] = df['CIRCULARITY'] / df['COMPACTNESS']
# Feature description: Ratio of CIRCULARITY to COMPACTNESS.
# Usefulness: The regularity compactness ratio provides insights into the relationship between extent of perimeter tightness (COMPACTNESS) and uniform circular spread (CIRCULARITY), which might be indicative of certain vehicle shapes.

end

python
# Explanation why the column HOLLOWS_RATIO is dropped
df.drop(columns=['HOLLOWS_RATIO'], inplace=True)
# The HOLLOWS_RATIO feature appears to be consistently high across different vehicle types without significant variance. Thus, it might not provide substantial discriminative power in distinguishing between different vehicle silhouettes.

# AVG_AXIS_LENGTH

# Feature description: Average of primary axis aspect ratio and maximum length aspect ratio.
# Usefulness: This feature provides an aggregate measure of the symmetry and balance between the two axes, which could be instrumental in distinguishing between different vehicle types that may have unique proportional characteristics.

# VARIANCE_OF_SCALED_VARIANCE 
df['VARIANCE_OF_SCALED_VARIANCE'] = df['SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS'] - df['SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS']
# Feature description: Difference between scaled variance along major and minor axes.
# Usefulness: Captures the difference in distribution spread along the major axis compared to the minor axis, potentially highlighting asymmetries characteristic of specific vehicle types.
  
# RECTANGULARITY_RATIO
df['RECTANGULARITY_RATIO'] = df['PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY'] / df['MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY']
# Feature description: Ratio of PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY to MAX.LENGTH_RECTANGULARITY.
# Usefulness: This ratio helps in understanding how uniformly the area of a vehicle is distributed across its primary axis and maximum length, giving insights into vehicle shape.

# SKEWNESS_DIFFERENCE
df['SKEWNESS_DIFFERENCE'] = df['SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS'] - df['SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS']
# Feature description: Difference between skewness about major and minor axes.
# Usefulness: Indicates potential asymmetries or irregularities in the distribution of mass along the axes, possibly aiding in distinguishing varied vehicle silhouettes.


Columns Suggested for Dropping:

python
# Explanation why the column SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS is dropped
df.drop(columns=['SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS'], inplace=True)
# The SKEWNESS_ABOUT_MAJOR_AXIS feature has a narrow range and offers limited variability, which might indicate it does not appreciably contribute to the differentiation between vehicle types.

# Explanation why the column KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS is dropped
df.drop(columns=['KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS'], inplace=True)
# With a range close to zero and limited variance, the KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS may not provide substantial insights into the dataset's vehicular differences and relationships.


Each of these newly added features is crafted to bring new dimensional insights and balance to the dataset, aimed at enhancing the prediction model's capability to differentiate between vehicle types effectively. The motivation behind dropping certain columns is the lack of variability or significance in value ranges that may otherwise have introduced noise rather than informative content in model learning.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle (OPEL, SAAB, BUS, VAN), using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

2025-12-30 01:54:42,620 - INFO - LLM Output: To further improve predictions for vehicle classification, more thoughtful feature engineering can be considered. Below are some potential new features and an explanation on why they may be useful:

python
# INERTIA_DIFFERENCE
df['INERTIA_DIFFERENCE'] = df['SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS'] - df['SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MAJOR_AXIS']
# Feature description: Difference between minor axis inertia and major axis inertia.
# Usefulness: This difference can provide insight into how vehicle silhouettes are balanced around their axes. Vehicles with more distinguishable major and minor axes might show clearer patterns related to specific vehicle types.

# AREA_DIFF_RATIO
df['AREA_DIFF_RATIO'] = df['COMPACTNESS'] / df['PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY']
# Feature description: Ratio of COMPACTNESS to PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY.
# Usefulness: Understanding the balance between tight packing (COMPACTNESS) and how much of the rectangular axis it fills (PR.AXIS_RECTANGULARITY) could offer valuable insights into the silhouette’s overall form.

# RADIUS_RATIO_SIN
df['RADIUS_RATIO_SIN'] = np.sin(df['RADIUS_RATIO'])
# Feature description: Sine transformation of RADIUS_RATIO.
# Usefulness: Applying sine transformation may capture periodic interactions or relations within the radius values, indicating potential cyclical patterns in vehicle structure.

# COMPACTNESS_CUBE
df['COMPACTNESS_CUBE'] = df['COMPACTNESS']  3
# Feature description: Cube of COMPACTNESS.
# Usefulness: Cubing the compactness may amplify differences in more compact vs. less compact vehicles, helping distinguish classes with optimally packed designs.

# SCATTER_RATIO_LOG
df['SCATTER_RATIO_LOG'] = np.log(df['SCATTER_RATIO'] + 1)
# Feature description: Logarithm of SCATTER_RATIO.
# Usefulness: Stabilizing variance and normalizing its distribution via a log transformation could enable better insight regarding variations with reduced exponential influence.

Code formatting for dropping columns:

python
# Explanation why the column KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS is dropped
df.drop(columns=['KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS'], inplace=True)
# KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS shows a limited range and might not provide significant differentiating power across vehicle types, potentially rendering it a low-value feature.
end

Each code block starts with python and ends with end. The transformations focus on enhancing insights and interpretability of existing features, stabilizing data variance, or amplifying useful distinctions amongst vehicle types.
