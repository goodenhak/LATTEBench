python

For evaluating the effectiveness of these features, you should conduct an experiment by training your model with these features included and compare the performance against using only existing features. If these new features enhance prediction accuracy or provide better generalization, they should be considered valuable additions; otherwise, they can be dropped as non-contributive. The decision should be based on empirical evidence post-implementation (e.g., using metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.). 

python
# Drop the column if it does not have predictive power or if it is highly correlated with other features without adding unique insight.
df.drop(columns=['XX'], inplace=True)
