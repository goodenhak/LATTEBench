# Explanation why the column DriversLicense is dropped
df.drop(columns=['DriversLicense'], inplace=True)

The DriversLicense feature may not be directly linked to an individual's likelihood of being approved for a credit card. Licensing is more a measure of one's eligibility to drive rather than a significant indicator of financial behavior or credit risk. Thus, it can be dropped from the dataset to improve model performance.
