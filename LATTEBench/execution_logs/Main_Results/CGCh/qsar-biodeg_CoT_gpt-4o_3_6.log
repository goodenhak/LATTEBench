2025-12-30 10:48:21,688 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for classifying chemicals based on their biodegradability, I'll start with feature engineering by creating new columns that might capture intricate patterns from the existing dataset. Let me generate additional features and highlight their potential usefulness:

python
# SpMax_L_squared
# The square of the leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix. Squaring might capture non-linear relationships more effectively.
# Usefulness: It may enhance the ability to discern differences between biodegradable and non-biodegradable chemicals, especially if there's a quadratic relationship.
df['SpMax_L_squared'] = df['SpMax_L']2

# J_Dz_reciprocal
# The reciprocal of the Balaban-like index. Provides a different scaling for electronegativity effects.
# Usefulness: Sometimes, inversely proportional relationships exist in chemical properties which could be relevant for biodegradability.
df['J_Dz_reciprocal'] = 1 / df['J_Dz(e)']

# Oxygen_to_heavy_atoms_ratio
# Ratio of oxygen atoms to heavy atoms. A higher number of oxygen might indicate more polar groups.
# Usefulness: Polar groups might be more or less biodegradable, affecting biodegradability classification.
df['Oxygen_to_heavy_atoms_ratio'] = df['nO'] / (df['nHM'] + 1e-9)

# NssssC_log
# Logarithm of the number of atoms of type ssssC plus a small constant to avoid math errors.
# Usefulness: Log transformation can manage skewness and help reveal multiplicative relationships in chemical properties.
df['NssssC_log'] = np.log(df['NssssC'] + 1e-9)

# C_per_heavy_atoms
# Ratio of percentage of Carbon atoms to heavy atoms. Measures the relative concentration of Carbon.
# Usefulness: Offers insight into the structural composition which might influence chemical reactivity and biodegradability.
df['C_per_heavy_atoms'] = df['C%'] / (df['nHM'] + 1e-9)

# SpMax_L_normalized
# Z-score normalization of SpMax_L. Helps in normalizing the range of values.
# Usefulness: Standardization often improves model performance by centering data and reducing variance issues.
df['SpMax_L_normalized'] = (df['SpMax_L'] - df['SpMax_L'].mean()) / df['SpMax_L'].std()

# B03_C_Cl_bin
# Binning the presence of C-Cl at topological distance 3 to binary indicators.
# Usefulness: Treating binary categorical data explicitly can improve model handling, especially useful for models like logistic regression.
df['B03_C_Cl_bin'] = (df['B03[C-Cl]'] > 0).astype(int)

# Non-zero_Substituted_benzene
# Binary indicator if there are substituted benzene rings.
# Usefulness: Presence of benzene rings influences chemical stability and might relate to biodegradability.
df['Non_zero_Substituted_benzene'] = (df['nCb-'] > 0).astype(int)
end

Below are some features or columns we might consider dropping if analysis shows they do not contribute positively to prediction or have too high multicollinearity. 

python
# Explanation why the column 'nHM' is dropped
# If 'nHM' shows high correlation with other engineered features or exhibits low variance, it may not add new information, thus considered for removal.
df.drop(columns=['nHM'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column 'B01[C-Br]' is dropped
# If very few chemicals have C - Br presence, and this feature doesn't contribute meaningfully to class separation, it might be considered for dropping.
df.drop(columns=['B01[C-Br]'], inplace=True)
end

This feature engineering aims to enhance model performance by introducing potentially more informative and non-linear features while simplifying the dataset by removing redundant ones. For each feature, further statistical tests can be performed to verify their p-value significance and ensure meaningful contribution.

# Description: Binary indicator for the presence of Carbon atoms (C% > 0).
# Usefulness: Presence of Carbon atoms is crucial for predicting biodegradability pathways.
df['Carbon_Present_Indicator'] = (df['C%'] > 0).astype(int)

# Feature: HyWi_B_m_sqrt
# Description: Square root of Hyper-Wiener-like index from Burden matrix weighted by mass.
# Usefulness: Square root transformation can reveal lower-scale differences more effectively, impacting stability measures.
df['HyWi_B_m_sqrt'] = np.sqrt(df['HyWi_B(m)'])

df['Ratio_Oxygen_Nitrogen'] = df['nO'] / (df['nN'] + 1e-9)


### Dropping Columns

python
# Explanation why the column 'nN-N' is dropped
# If the number of N hydrazines shows limited variance or does not correlate with the dependent variable, it can be receded as redundant.
df.drop(columns=['nN-N'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column 'B03[C-Cl]' is dropped
# If the presence of C-Cl at certain distances rarely appears and does not provide meaningful separation between classes, consider it redundant.
df.drop(columns=['B03[C-Cl]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column 'B03[C-Br]' is dropped
# If the presence of C-Br at a topological distance is rare and non-impactful for class separation, it might be dropped.
df.drop(columns=['B04[C-Br]'], inplace=True)


These transformations focus on enhancing the dataset by capturing potential non-linear relationships, leveraging binary indicators, and acquiring ratios that offer insights into chemical balances affecting biodegradability.

2025-12-30 10:49:07,550 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for classifying chemicals into biodegradable and non-biodegradable, we can employ feature engineering techniques. Below are some suggestions for additional feature generation:

python
# SpMax_L_squared
# The square of the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix. Squaring can capture non-linear relationships effectively.
# Usefulness: Enhances the ability to discern differences between biodegradable and non-biodegradable chemicals if there's a quadratic relationship.
df['SpMax_L_squared'] = df['SpMax_L']2

# log_Carbon_Nitrogen_Ratio
# Logarithm of the Carbon_Nitrogen_Ratio offers a reduced scale.
# Usefulness: Mitigates skewness and manages extreme values in the C:N ratio, aiding model sensitivity.
df['log_Carbon_Nitrogen_Ratio'] = np.log(df['Carbon_Nitrogen_Ratio'] + 1e-9)

# Cosine_SpMax_B
# Cosine of the leading eigenvalue from the Burden matrix, weighted by mass.
# Usefulness: Captures periodicity and non-linear cyclical effects regarding molecular characteristics to biodegradability.
df['Cosine_SpMax_B'] = np.cos(df['SpMax_B(m)'])

# nN_zscore
# Z-score normalization of the number of Nitrogen atoms.
# Usefulness: Standardizes the variable for better model performance, centering data and managing scale differences.
df['nN_zscore'] = (df['nN'] - df['nN'].mean()) / df['nN'].std()

# Weighted_Spectral_Mass
# Ratio of SM6_L to Mass_Weighted_Spectral_Ratio for stability information.
# Usefulness: Balances mass-spectral terms affecting stability and possibly biodegradability.
df['Weighted_Spectral_Mass'] = df['SM6_L'] / (df['Mass_Weighted_Spectral_Ratio'] + 1e-9)


Explanation of drops:

python
# Explanation why the column 'Log_Heavy_Atoms' is dropped
# If the feature exhibits high skewness resulting in redundancy when combined with other logarithmic transformations.
df.drop(columns=['Log_Heavy_Atoms'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column 'B03[C-Cl]' is dropped
# If the presence of C - Cl at topological distance 3 appears inhomogeneously distributed or rarely influencing biodegradability classes.
df.drop(columns=['B03[C-Cl]'], inplace=True)


These feature engineering steps aim to tackle skewness, non-linear relationships, and information redundancy, ultimately hoping to enhance model capacity to separate biodegradable from non-biodegradable compounds.
