2025-12-30 12:12:27,180 - INFO - LLM Output: In order to identify additional useful features that could enhance predictions for the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode, let's explore and evaluate some potential feature engineering ideas. I'll propose a few that are based on the available operators and existing features, and justify their potential usefulness.

### Proposed New Features:

python
# fork_exec_combined
# Combined influence of fork and exec calls on CPU user mode
# Usefulness: The interaction between the frequency of process creation (forks) and execution (execs) might better capture the overall system behavior impacting CPU usage in user mode.
df['fork_exec_combined'] = df['fork'] * df['exec']


python
# memory_io_pressure
# Combined ratio of memory pressure and I/O operations
# Usefulness: This feature might highlight scenarios where high memory pressure coincides with intensive I/O activity, influencing CPU time allocation in user mode.
df['memory_io_pressure'] = df['memory_pressure'] * df['io_operations']


python
# adjusted_cpu_load
# Adjusted CPU load including swaps and run queue size
# Usefulness: Provides a comprehensive measure of CPU load considering swapping activities that could delay or alter CPU's time in user mode.
df['adjusted_cpu_load'] = df['cpu_load_estimate'] / (df['system_vs_user_memory'] + 1)


### Dropped Features Justifications:
Given the features available, it's crucial to ensure that all retained features offer distinct and relevant insights. However, based on the analysis, there are no immediate redundancies. Nonetheless, scrutiny against multicollinearity should always be conducted as part of exploratory data analysis (EDA) prior to model training.

Implementing these features should help capture more complex interactions within the dataset, potentially leading to improved prediction outcomes.

# Feature description: Sum of fork and exec calls per second with a log transformation.
# Usefulness: The log-transformed sum of fork and exec calls provides insight into process creation activities. Frequent process creation and execution can be indicative of user mode activity, especially in a multi-user environment where diverse tasks are running.
df['process_creation_frequency'] = np.log1p(df['fork'] + df['exec'])
end

Explanation: In a multi-user system, frequent creation of new processes (fork) and execution of programs (exec) can contribute significantly to CPU usage in user mode. By log-transforming the sum of these operations, we stabilize any variance and skewness in the data, making it more amenable to modeling.

Task: The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very cpu-bound programs. Predict the portion of time that cpus run in user mode from all attributes.
