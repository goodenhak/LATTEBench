2025-12-30 01:39:48,902 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the dataset description and usefulness of features for the downstream task of classifying chemicals into two classes of biodegradability, we can engineer several new features that might improve the predictive performance or provide clearer insights into the dataset:

1. Oxygen to Carbon Ratio
   - Feature name: oxygen_carbon_ratio
   - Feature description: Ratio of the number of oxygen atoms to the number of carbon atoms.
   - Usefulness: A higher ratio may indicate more reactive sites, potentially making the molecule more ready for biodegradation.

python
# oxygen_carbon_ratio
# Compute the ratio of the number of oxygen atoms to carbon percentage
# Usefulness: Molecules with a higher ratio of oxygen to carbon could have more polar sites, influencing biodegradability readiness.
df['oxygen_carbon_ratio'] = df['nO'] / (df['C%'] / 100.0)
end

2. Total Atom Count
   - Feature name: total_atom_count
   - Feature description: Sum of heavy atoms, nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, and halogen atoms.
   - Usefulness: Total atom count helps capture the overall size and complexity of a molecule which could affect its biodegradation.

python
# total_atom_count
# Sum up the counts of heavy atoms, nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, and halogen atoms.
# Usefulness: Captures the overall atomic complexity which may influence biodegradation process.
df['total_atom_count'] = df['nHM'] + df['nN'] + df['nO'] + df['nX']
end

3. Carbon-Nitrogen Interaction
   - Feature name: C_N_interaction
   - Feature description: Combined frequencies of C-N interactions at different topological distances.
   - Usefulness: Understanding carbon-nitrogen interactions can provide insights into the structural setup influencing reactivity and biodegradability.

python
# C_N_interaction
# Sum frequencies of C-N interactions from different topological distances.
# Usefulness: Provides insight into structural setup and complexity due to carbon-nitrogen interactions which can affect biodegradability.
df['C_N_interaction'] = df['F02[C-N]'] + df['F03[C-N]'] + df['F04[C-N]']
end

4. SpMax_L Normalization
   - Feature name: SpMax_L_normalized
   - Feature description: Normalized SpMax_L using min-max scaling.
   - Usefulness: Normalized values can be used alongside other scaled features for comparative analysis or model input, enhancing prediction consistency.

python
# SpMax_L_normalized
# Normalize SpMax_L using min-max scaling.
# Usefulness: Provides a standardized scale for comparing SpMax_L across different samples, aiding in model performance.
df['SpMax_L_normalized'] = (df['SpMax_L'] - 2.0) / (6.496 - 2.0)
end

5. Connectivity Indicator
   - Feature name: high_intrinsic_connectivity
   - Feature description: Indicates if the intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index Psi_i_A is above the median.
   - Usefulness: Higher connectivity could imply more inherent structural robustness, affecting biodegradability.

python
# high_intrinsic_connectivity
# Create an indicator for high intrinsic connectivity based on Psi_i_A.
# Usefulness: Higher intrinsic connectivity might contribute to structural robustness or complexity, influencing degradation readiness.
df['high_intrinsic_connectivity'] = df['Psi_i_A'] > 2.459
end

These features are created based on observations from the available attributes and their potential impact on the biodegradation of compounds, which should enrich the dataset and enhance model performance through capturing essential chemical properties and interactions.

2025-12-30 01:40:38,998 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions on the biodegradability of chemicals, it's helpful to perform feature engineering that can uncover relevant patterns and insights from the chemical descriptors. Here are the accepted features along with their usefulness descriptions in enhancing the prediction task:

python
# Accepted Features

# nHM_less_than_median
# Create a binary column indicating if the number of heavy atoms (nHM) is less than the median.
# Usefulness: Heavy atoms can be significant in chemical stability and reactions. Understanding their count relative to the median can help in understanding the complexity of the molecule. It could be an indicator of readiness for biodegradability, as fewer heavy atoms might mean simpler structures.
df['nHM_less_than_median'] = df['nHM'] < 0.0

# C_percent_above_mean
# Create a binary column indicating if the percentage of C atoms (C%) is above the mean value.
# Usefulness: Carbon content is crucial for organic compound structure. Molecules with a higher percentage of carbon atoms might be less likely to biodegrade quickly due to their potentially more complex or stable structures.
df['C_percent_above_mean'] = df['C%'] > 36.8107

# High_nO_count
# Create a binary column indicating if the number of oxygen atoms (nO) is higher than the third quartile.
# Usefulness: Oxygen atoms in a molecule are involved in forming polar sites, which can make molecules more reactive and possibly easier to biodegrade. Hence, counting molecules with higher oxygen could be useful for classification readiness.
df['High_nO_count'] = df['nO'] > 3.0

# Is_SdO_zero
# Create a binary column to indicate if the sum of dO E-states (SdO) is zero.
# Usefulness: SdO can be reflective of certain structural aspects that affect the molecule's behavior in reactions. Knowing if it is zero allows identification of molecules lacking certain potentially reactive characteristics, impacting biodegradability.
df['Is_SdO_zero'] = df['SdO'] == 0.0

# F03_C-O_high_frequency
# Create a binary column indicating if the frequency of C-O at topological distance 3 (F03[C-O]) is higher than the third quartile.
# Usefulness: High frequency of C-O bonds can indicate a potential for increased reactivity due to polar sites, facilitating biodegradability.
df['F03_C-O_high_frequency'] = df['F03[C-O]'] > 6.0

# total_heavy_atom_ratio
# Compute the ratio of heavy atoms over total atoms (nHM, nN, nO, nX)
# Usefulness: Provides insight into the density of heavy atoms in comparison to total atom count, indicating potential complexity and resistance to biodegradation.
total_atoms = df[['nHM', 'nN', 'nO', 'nX']].sum(axis=1)
df['total_heavy_atom_ratio'] = df['nHM'] / total_atoms.replace(0, 1)  # to avoid division by zero

# Me_normalized
# Normalize mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (Me) using min-max scaling.
# Usefulness: Provides a standardized scale for comparing electronegativity across different samples, potentially aiding reaction readiness and biodegradability analysis.
df['Me_normalized'] = (df['Me'] - 0.957) / (1.311 - 0.957)

# nN_high_count
# Create a binary column indicating if the number of nitrogen atoms (nN) is higher than the third quartile.
# Usefulness: Higher nitrogen content can influence molecular interactions, affecting the structural complexity and possibly biodegradation readiness.
df['nN_high_count'] = df['nN'] > 1.0

# LOC_above_mean
# Create a binary column indicating if the lopping centric index (LOC) is above the mean value.
# Usefulness: This can help in identifying molecules that have a structural aspect potentially affecting their biological reactivity or biodegradability.
df['LOC_above_mean'] = df['LOC'] > 1.3693
end

By incorporating these engineered features, the model can potentially capture more nuanced relationships between molecular structure and biodegradability, improving overall predictive performance. These features are carefully selected based on their potential to add useful domain knowledge and insights into the chemical properties impacting biodegradability.
