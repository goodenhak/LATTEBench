Next, we will drop certain features that may introduce noise or redundancy without providing significant predictive power.

python
# Explanation why the column SpMax_A is dropped
# The SpMax_A feature (Leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix) may be redundant with SpMax_L from Laplace matrix which generally captures more comprehensive structural node connections.
df.drop(columns=['SpMax_A'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column B03[C-Cl] is dropped
# This column describes a very specific structural feature which may not generalize well across a wide range of chemicals, reducing its usefulness in classification.
df.drop(columns=['B03[C-Cl]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column Psi_i_1d is dropped
# This intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index is highly specialized and may not directly contribute to the generalizable factors influencing biodegradability.
df.drop(columns=['Psi_i_1d'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column F01[N-N] is dropped
# Very few observations have non-zero values, making it sparse and potentially less informative overall for biodegradability prediction.
df.drop(columns=['F01[N-N]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column SdssC is dropped
# The presence of atoms of this type doesn't explicitly align with known biodegradability factors and has zero median and third quartile values indicating limited spread or influence.

2025-12-30 01:47:04,445 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the predictive power of your model, I suggest creating additional features from the existing attributes. Below are a few feature engineering ideas based on the provided dataset:

### New Features to Add:

python
# Feature name: Ring_Oxygen_Interaction
# Feature description: The interaction between the number of circuits and the number of oxygen atoms. 
# Usefulness: The presence of oxygen within ring structures can significantly influence chemical reactions and biodegradability.
df['Ring_Oxygen_Interaction'] = df['nCIR'] * df['nO']

# Feature name: Oxygen_Halogen_Ratio
# Feature description: Ratio of the number of oxygen atoms to the number of halogen atoms. 
# Usefulness: Understanding the proportion of oxygen to halogens is vital, as halogens can impact chemical reactivity and biodegradability.
df['Oxygen_Halogen_Ratio'] = df['nO'] / (df['nX'] + 1)  # Adding 1 to avoid division by zero

# Feature name: Log_Heavy_Atoms
# Feature description: Log transformation of the number of heavy atoms.
# Usefulness: This transformation stabilizes the variance, capturing the contribution of larger molecules in biodegradation.
df['Log_Heavy_Atoms'] = df['nHM'].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))  # Adding 1 to avoid log(0)

# Feature name: Nitrogen_Interaction_Scaled
# Feature description: Interaction term between nitrogen atoms and spectral positive sum normalized by molecular size.
# Usefulness: Nitrogen atoms and spectral sums are crucial in revealing potential reaction sites, scaled by molecular size effects.
df['Nitrogen_Interaction_Scaled'] = (df['nN'] * df['SpPosA_B(p)']) / (df['nHM'] + df['nCp'] + df['nN'] + df['nX'])


### Columns to Drop:

python
# Explanation why the column F03[C-N] is dropped
# The feature appears to have low median and mean values across the dataset, suggesting limited variability, and potentially lower relevance to biodegradability.
df.drop(columns=['F03[C-N]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column nArNO2 is dropped
# This feature represents the presence of specific nitro groups, which maybe less influential on general biodegradability across various types of chemical structures due to its low mean value.
df.drop(columns=['nArNO2'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column B04[C-Br] is dropped
# Given its low filling percentage, it might contribute limited information to the model, and may not generalize well for various substances.
df.drop(columns=['B04[C-Br]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column nN-N is dropped
# The low mean and median values suggest that this feature is sparse, indicating it might add noise rather than meaningful information to the prediction model.
df.drop(columns=['nN-N'], inplace=True)


These new features and column drops are constructed based on the available data statistics and assumptions about chemical properties influencing biodegradability. They aim to encapsulate additional relevant information that could assist in improving prediction accuracy.

2025-12-30 01:47:25,336 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for the classification of chemicals into biodegradable and non-biodegradable classes, we can introduce additional features derived from the existing attributes. These features can enhance the dataset with potentially informative attributes for our predictive model. Here's how new features can be engineered, and which existing ones might be dropped for redundancy or irrelevance:

### Additional Features

python
# Feature name: Atom_Ratio
# Feature description: Ratio between the number of heavy atoms and the total number of primary and ring tertiary C(sp3).
# Usefulness: This feature helps in understanding the complexity of the molecule structure, contributing to biodegradability analysis.
df['Atom_Ratio'] = df['nHM'] / (df['nCp'] + df['nCrt'] + 1)

# Feature name: Oxygen_Density
# Feature description: Number of oxygen atoms per spectral moment of order 6 from the Laplace matrix.
# Usefulness: Denotes oxygen content relative to the spectral properties which could influence reactivity and biodegradation pathways.
df['Oxygen_Density'] = df['nO'] / (df['SM6_L'] + 1)

# Feature name: N_Contribution
# Feature description: Ratio of nitrogen atoms to circuits in the molecule.
# Usefulness: Provides insight into nitrogen’s structural impact, potentially affecting the molecule's biodegradability.
df['N_Contribution'] = df['nN'] / (df['nCIR'] + 1)

# Feature name: Electronegativity_Stability
# Feature description: Interaction term between mean electronegativity and spectral positive sum weighted by polarizability.
# Usefulness: Bridge chemical reactivity and stability of molecular structures, suggesting vulnerability to degradative processes.
df['Electronegativity_Stability'] = df['Me'] * df['SpPosA_B(p)']



### Dropping Features

python
# Explanation why the column nN-N is dropped
# Very few observations have non-zero values, making it sparse and potentially less informative overall for biodegradability prediction.
df.drop(columns=['nN-N'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column B04[C-Br] is dropped
# The presence of C-Br at topological distance 4 is a very specific feature that may not substantially contribute to general biodegradability insights.
df.drop(columns=['B04[C-Br]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column SdO is dropped
# This feature is based on a specific E-state descriptor that might not align significantly with general biodegradability.
df.drop(columns=['SdO'], inplace=True)


Each added feature provides additional context to the biodegradability analysis by incorporating molecular structure aspects, electronegativity balance, and elemental contributions. Likewise, the dropped features were carefully chosen due to their limited contribution across the dataset or redundancy with other attributes.

### Dropped Columns

python
# Explanation why the column nN-N is dropped
# Due to its low mean and median values, indicating limited occurrence, the feature is potentially less informative for biodegradability.
df.drop(columns=['nN-N'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column nArCOOR is dropped
# Represents a specific structural feature with low occurrence, reducing its utility in general biodegradability predictions.
df.drop(columns=['nArCOOR'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column nX is dropped
# The high variability and scope of halogen atoms may introduce noise rather than contribute positively to biodegradability predictions.
df.drop(columns=['nX'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column B01[C-Br] is dropped
# This binary structural presence does not provide comprehensive interaction or reactivity information necessary for biodegradability prediction.
df.drop(columns=['B01[C-Br]'], inplace=True)


When implementing these features and column pruning strategies, it is essential to validate their impact using cross-validation to ensure that they genuinely improve the model's predictive capability rather than add unnecessary complexity or redundancy.

2025-12-30 01:47:55,842 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions in the classification task of biodegradability, consider adding features that enhance interpretability and capture relevant chemical interactions. Below are the proposed engineered features and explanations, along with justifications for dropping certain columns.

### Feature Engineering

python
# Feature name: Ring_System_Complexity
# Feature description: Count of number of ring tertiary carbon atoms multiplied by number of circuits in the molecule.
# Usefulness: This captures the complexity and compactness of the molecular ring system, which could influence how easily the molecule can be biodegraded.
df['Ring_System_Complexity'] = df['nCrt'] * df['nCIR']

# Feature name: Oxygen_Density
# Feature description: Density of oxygen atoms, calculated by normalizing the number of oxygen atoms by the molecular size.
# Usefulness: Higher oxygen density could lead to increased reactivity, which is essential for biodegradability.
df['Oxygen_Density'] = df['nO'] / (df['SpMax_L'] + df['J_Dz(e)'] + df['nHM'] + df['nCp'] + 1)

# Feature name: Polar_Hydrogen_Interaction
# Feature description: Interaction between the number of donor atoms for H-bonds and the spectral positive sum weighted by polarizability.
# Usefulness: Highlights potential hydrogen bonding and polar interactions that are vital in the biodegradation process.
df['Polar_Hydrogen_Interaction'] = df['nHDon'] * df['SpPosA_B(p)']

# Feature name: Charge_Distribution_Index
# Feature description: Calculated using the mean electronegativity difference and the mean ionic potential scaled by carbon atoms.
# Usefulness: Provides insight into charge distribution and reactivity, affecting how the molecule interacts with the environment.
df['Charge_Distribution_Index'] = df['Mean_Electronegativity_Difference'] * df['Mi']


### Dropping Uninformative Features

python
# Explanation why the column SpMax_A is dropped
# The SpMax_A feature (Leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix) may be redundant with SpMax_L from Laplace matrix which generally captures more comprehensive structural node connections.
df.drop(columns=['SpMax_A'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column F05[C-N] is dropped
# This column describes frequency of C-N at topological distance 5, similar to 3 and 4 which are more direct and relevant for understanding biodegradability interactions.
df.drop(columns=['F05[C-N]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column nCRX3 is dropped
# This feature describes a very specific structural attribute with a low occurrence across the dataset, thus potentially contributing little to generalizable biodegradability predictions.
df.drop(columns=['nCRX3'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column N-073 is dropped
# The feature N-073 represents a very specialized structural attribute not prevalent enough in the dataset to add significant predictive power for biodegradability classification.
df.drop(columns=['N-073'], inplace=True)
 

### Rationale
- Ring_System_Complexity and Oxygen_Density capture structural and compositional factors directly related to chemical reactivity, potentially influencing biodegradability.
- Polar_Hydrogen_Interaction illustrates the molecule's capacity for hydrogen bonding, vital in reactions leading to degradation.
- Charge_Distribution_Index provides insights on molecular stability and charge distribution, relevant for interaction potentials influencing biodegradability.
- Dropped features, such as specific adjacency eigenvectors and infrequently occurring features, are deemed non-contributory or redundant for the classification task at hand.
