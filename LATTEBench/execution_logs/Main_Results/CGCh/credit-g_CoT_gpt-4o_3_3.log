# age_bin
# Binning 'age' into categories such as young, middle-aged, and senior to capture any nonlinear relationship between age and credit risk.
# Usefulness: Simplifies the age feature into meaningful buckets which might highlight different risk profiles.

# Label encoding of 'residence_since', categorizing residence duration into short, medium, and long-term stay durations.
# Usefulness: Indicates stability in residence, which can impact creditworthiness.
