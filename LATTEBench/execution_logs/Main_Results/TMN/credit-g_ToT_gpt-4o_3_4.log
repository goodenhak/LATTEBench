Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, 0<=X<200, no checking, >=200]
- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 72], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 21.0733, Std = 12.4448

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, 0<=X<200, no checking, >=200]
- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 72], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 21.0733, Std = 12.4448
- property_payment_plan_interaction: Interaction between property magnitude and other payment plans (categorical), categories = [no known property_none, car_stores, real estate_none, car_none, life insurance_none, no known property_stores, real estate_stores, real estate_bank, life insurance_bank, car_bank, life insurance_stores, no known property_bank]
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [existing paid, critical/other existing credit, delayed previously, all paid, no credits/all paid]
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [338, 15945], Q1 = 1391.75, Median = 2356.0, Q3 = 4122.5, Mean = 3289.4300, Std = 2749.0204
- residence_since: Present residence since X years (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.8933, Std = 1.0942
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, no known savings, 500<=X<1000, 100<=X<500, >=1000]
- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9700, Std = 1.1260
- own_telephone: Telephone (categorical), categories = [yes, none]
- age_bin: Creating bins for age to capture age groups with similar characteristics (categorical), categories = [(30.2, 41.4], (18.944, 30.2], (63.8, 75.0], (52.6, 63.8], (41.4, 52.6]]

Data Examples:
checking_status is <0. duration is 12. property_payment_plan_interaction is real estate_none. credit_history is existing paid. credit_amount is 1228. residence_since is 2. savings_status is <100. installment_commitment is 4. own_telephone is none. age_bin is (18.944, 30.2].
Answer: 0
checking_status is no checking. duration is 18. property_payment_plan_interaction is real estate_none. credit_history is existing paid. credit_amount is 433. residence_since is 4. savings_status is <100. installment_commitment is 3. own_telephone is none. age_bin is (18.944, 30.2].
Answer: 0
checking_status is <0. duration is 8. property_payment_plan_interaction is real estate_none. credit_history is critical/other existing credit. credit_amount is 731. residence_since is 4. savings_status is <100. installment_commitment is 4. own_telephone is none. age_bin is (41.4, 52.6].
Answer: 1
checking_status is no checking. duration is 48. property_payment_plan_interaction is car_none. credit_history is critical/other existing credit. credit_amount is 2751. residence_since is 3. savings_status is no known savings. installment_commitment is 4. own_telephone is yes. age_bin is (30.2, 41.4].
Answer: 1


Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
