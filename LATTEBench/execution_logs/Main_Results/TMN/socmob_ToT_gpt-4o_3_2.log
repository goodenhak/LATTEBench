You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Proprietor, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Manager, Salesman-Retail, Craftsman-Construction, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Clerk, Salesman-Nonretail, Craftsmen-Other, Service_Worker, Professional_Self-Employed, Laborer-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Professional-Salaried, Farm_Laborer]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional_Self-Employed, Craftsman-Construction, Professional-Salaried, Clerk, Farm_Laborer, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Operative-Manufacturing, Service_Worker, Proprietor, Salesman-Nonretail, Craftsmen-Other, Manager, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Laborer-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Salesman-Retail]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [black, white]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 11.9, Mean = 19.3561, Std = 51.3517

Data Examples:
fathers_occupation is Farm_Laborer. sons_occupation is Manager. family_structure is intact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 7.3.
Answer: 0
fathers_occupation is Clerk. sons_occupation is Clerk. family_structure is nonintact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 26.5.
Answer: 0
fathers_occupation is Farm_Laborer. sons_occupation is Farm_Laborer. family_structure is nonintact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 46.2.
Answer: 1
fathers_occupation is Farmer/Farm_Manager. sons_occupation is Laborer-Manufacturing. family_structure is nonintact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 17.0.
Answer: 1

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
Possible next three steps:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 11.9, Mean = 19.3561, Std = 51.3517
- race: race (categorical), categories = [black, white]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional_Self-Employed, Craftsman-Construction, Professional-Salaried, Clerk, Farm_Laborer, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Operative-Manufacturing, Service_Worker, Proprietor, Salesman-Nonretail, Craftsmen-Other, Manager, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Laborer-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Salesman-Retail]

Data Examples:
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 40.8. race is white. sons_occupation is Operative-Nonmanufacturing.
Answer: 0
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 2.7. race is white. sons_occupation is Proprietor.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 11.9, Mean = 19.3561, Std = 51.3517
- race: race (categorical), categories = [black, white]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional_Self-Employed, Craftsman-Construction, Professional-Salaried, Clerk, Farm_Laborer, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Operative-Manufacturing, Service_Worker, Proprietor, Salesman-Nonretail, Craftsmen-Other, Manager, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Laborer-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Salesman-Retail]
- race_label_encoded: Encoded_race_as_numerical_values (numerical), range = [0, 1], Q1 = 0.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 0.5065, Std = 0.5003
- sons_occupation_label_encoded: Encoded_sons_occupation_as_numerical_values (numerical), range = [0, 16], Q1 = 4.0, Median = 8.0, Q3 = 12.0, Mean = 7.7734, Std = 4.7979
- race_occupation_interaction: Interaction_between_race_and_encoded_sons_occupation (categorical), categories = [black_12, black_1, ..., black_11]

Data Examples:
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 14.6. race is black. sons_occupation is Operative-Nonmanufacturing. race_label_encoded is 0. sons_occupation_label_encoded is 10. race_occupation_interaction is black_10.
Answer: 0
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 154.3. race is white. sons_occupation is Professional-Salaried. race_label_encoded is 1. sons_occupation_label_encoded is 11. race_occupation_interaction is white_11.
Answer: 0
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 4.4. race is black. sons_occupation is Craftsmen-Other. race_label_encoded is 0. sons_occupation_label_encoded is 3. race_occupation_interaction is black_3.
Answer: 1
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 0.0. race is black. sons_occupation is Laborer-Manufacturing. race_label_encoded is 0. sons_occupation_label_encoded is 6. race_occupation_interaction is black_6.
Answer: 1


Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
