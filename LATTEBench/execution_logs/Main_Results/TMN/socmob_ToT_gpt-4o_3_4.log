You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Farm_Laborer, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsman-Construction, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Proprietor, Service_Worker, Operative-Manufacturing, Manager, Professional_Self-Employed, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Clerk, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional-Salaried, Craftsman-Construction, Farm_Laborer, Salesman-Retail]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.5, Mean = 17.2574, Std = 46.5042

Data Examples:
fathers_occupation is Craftsmen-Other. sons_occupation is Proprietor. family_structure is intact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 2.7.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Farm_Laborer, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsman-Construction, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor]

- race_effect_on_occupation: Mean counts for son's first occupation grouped by race (numerical), range = [2.9551622418879053, 30.953672316384186], Q1 = 2.9551622418879053, Median = 30.953672316384186, Q3 = 30.953672316384186, Mean = 17.2574, Std = 14.0061

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.
