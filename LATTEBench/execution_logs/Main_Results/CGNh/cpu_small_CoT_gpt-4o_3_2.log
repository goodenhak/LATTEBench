   - Reasoning: The number of fork calls (process creation) relative to the total number of system calls might give insights into the degree of interactive processing occurring on the system, which can influence CPU usage in user mode.

2. <io_activity_level><plus><sread><swrite><Combined_input_output_activity_as_a_sum_of_system_read_and_write_calls>
   - Reasoning: The combination of read and write system calls can act as a measure of I/O activity. High I/O typically affects CPU usage because of context switching or I/O-bound processing that might affect user mode time.

3. <memory_pressure_indicator><subtract><freemem><runqsz><Memory_pressure_as_difference_between_free_memory_and_queue_size>
   - Reasoning: By subtracting the run queue size from available memory pages, we attempt to capture the balance between memory availability and CPU queue pressure. High memory availability combined with a lower queue size might suggest lesser strain on the CPU, possibly affecting user mode time.

2025-10-28 20:13:04,340 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features for predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode, we should focus on capturing different aspects of system utilization, resource allocation, and process management. Here are three potential feature engineering steps that might improve the prediction model's performance:

1. <write_intensity><ratio><lwrite><swrite><Ratio_of_memory_writes_to_system_write_calls_as_an_indication_of_write_intensive_operations>
   - Reasoning: This feature aims to capture the intensity of write operations by comparing the writes between the system memory and user memory against system write calls. An increased intensity might indicate scenarios with significant data output operations, possibly affecting CPU usage patterns in user mode.

2. <combined_io_calls><plus><sread><swrite><Sum_of_system_read_and_write_calls_to_assess_overall_input_output_activity>
   - Reasoning: Combining system read and write calls provides an aggregate measure of I/O activities. Such a combined metric can help understand how I/O-bound processes might impact CPU user mode time, as heavy I/O activities can influence processing patterns.

3. <memory_to_swap_ratio><divide><freemem><freeswap><Ratio_of_free_memory_to_free_swap_as_an_assessment_of_memory_pressure>
   - Reasoning: The ratio of free memory to free swap can indicate the system's memory pressure. If this ratio is low, it suggests high memory pressure, potentially causing more CPU time to be spent handling memory management tasks, thereby impacting user mode operations.

These new features emphasize different aspects of system behavior, including write intensity, overall I/O activity, and memory pressure, all potentially significant for understanding CPU utilization in user mode.

2025-10-28 20:13:42,588 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve your model's performance in predicting the time CPUs run in user mode, we can explore transformation and generation of new features based on the operations provided. Here are three potential steps:

1. Feature: System Call Intensity Ratio
   - <system_call_intensity_ratio><ratio><scall><sread><Ratio_of_total_system_calls_to_system_read_calls>
   - Reasoning: This feature provides insight into the system's call activity by comparing the total system calls against specific read calls. It might help in understanding how system-level operations are impacting CPU usage.

2. Feature: Memory Stress Indicator
   - <memory_stress_indicator><subtract><freemem><runqsz><Difference_between_free_memory_and_queue_size_as_a_memory_stress_indicator>
   - Reasoning: This feature could be an indicator of memory stress by evaluating the difference between free memory and the number of processes in the run queue. Low values might indicate higher memory stress, thereby impacting CPU user mode operations.

3. Feature: Weighted I/O Operation Intensity
   - <weighted_io_operation_intensity><multiply><swrite><io_calls_ratio><Product_of_system_writes_and_IO_calls_ratio_to_assess_IO_intensity>
   - Reasoning: By weighting system writes with the IO calls ratio, this feature indicates how intense the I/O operations are. Higher values may suggest more I/O operations affecting user mode CPU time intensely, potentially improving the prediction accuracy. 

These features are constructed by examining relationships that may influence CPU user mode times, such as system calls, memory management, and I/O operation intensity. These new features may provide additional predictive power to the model.

2025-10-28 20:14:34,581 - INFO - LLM Output: Sure, let's generate three next steps for feature engineering:

1. Feature: Memory Stress Relative Ratio
   - Name: <memory_stress_relative_ratio>
   - Operation: ratio
   - Feature1: runqsz
   - Feature2: freemem
   - Description: Ratio_of_queue_size_to_free_memory_as_a_measure_of_relative_memory_pressure

   Reasoning: By evaluating how the run queue size compares to available free memory, we gain insights into potential bottlenecks or pressure points in memory allocation relative to processing demands. High queue sizes with low available memory could indicate significant memory stress, influencing CPU performance in user mode.

2. Feature: CPU-IO Combined Burden
   - Name: <cpu_io_combined_burden>
   - Operation: plus
   - Feature1: cpu_interaction_intensity
   - Feature2: io_calls_ratio
   - Description: Sum_of_CPU_interaction_and_IO_calls_ratio_as_a_combined_burden_measure

   Reasoning: This feature combines CPU interaction intensity with IO calls ratio, providing a holistic view of the system's operational burden. It helps in understanding the joint effect of CPU and IO operations on the system's performance, potentially correlating with user mode CPU usage.

3. Feature: Normalized Run Queue Size
   - Name: <normalized_runqsz>
   - Operation: minmax
   - Feature1: runqsz
   - Description: Minmax_normalized_run_queue_size_to_standardize_queue_impact_across_samples

   Reasoning: Normalizing the run queue size helps in reducing the impact of extreme values and better integrates the feature into machine learning models. This ensures that variations in queue sizes are treated equitably across the dataset, aiding in more reliable predictions of user mode CPU time. 

These steps aim to enhance the descriptive power of the features related to memory stress, CPU-IO interactions, and process queue management, potentially improving the model's prediction accuracy.
