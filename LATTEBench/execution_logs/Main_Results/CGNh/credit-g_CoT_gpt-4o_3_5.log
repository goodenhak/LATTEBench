2. <employment_purpose_cross><cross><employment><purpose><Crossing employment and purpose to identify patterns in credit risk related to job type and the intended use of credit>  
   Reasoning: By combining employment and purpose, this feature captures interactions that may indicate specific risk profiles. For example, stable employment with a business purpose might differ from unstable employment seeking education credit.

3. <existing_credit_by_dependents_ratio><divide><existing_credits><num_dependents><Determine the proportion of existing credits to the number of dependents to understand credit burden per dependent>  
   Reasoning: This feature helps to assess the financial burden per dependent, offering insight into how much credit a person with dependents has relative to their familial obligations, which can impact credit repayment ability.

2025-09-21 02:08:41,992 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible next steps for feature engineering, aimed at enhancing the model's predictive performance:

1. <checking_credit_cross><cross><checking_status><credit_history><Crossing checking_status and credit_history to capture interaction effects that may reveal significant patterns in creditworthiness>

   - Reasoning: Both checking account status and credit history are pivotal indicators in assessing credit risk. By crossing these categories, we can uncover nuanced relationships between account status and historical credit behavior, potentially identifying high-risk profiles.

2. <age_duration_product><multiply><age><duration><Assessing the compounded effect of age and loan duration by multiplying them to evaluate risk related to both factors simultaneously>

   - Reasoning: Age and loan duration independently influence credit risk, with older applicants possibly having a different risk profile compared to younger applicants. By multiplying these, we can gauge the impact of these combined factors to better capture risk nuances associated with age and loan length.

3. <employment_savings_interaction><cross><employment_encoded><savings_status><Crossing employment_encoded and savings_status to explore the joint influence of job stability and savings on credit decisions>

   - Reasoning: Employment stability and savings status are critical in determining a person's financial health. Interacting these variables can reveal important patterns, such as high stability and substantial savings possibly indicating better creditworthiness compared to other combinations.
