2025-09-21 02:10:54,404 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <loan_duration_effective><multiply><duration><age><Calculates the effective loan duration based on age, potentially reflecting maturity and long-term financial planning abilities, which could influence creditworthiness.

   Reasoning: Combining duration with age through multiplication could provide insight into an applicant's maturity in relation to the duration of financial obligations. Older applicants might have more experience or a different perspective in handling credit, which can affect credit decisions.

2. <credit_history_position><label_encode><credit_history><Transforms categorical credit history into numerical labels to facilitate integration with other numerical features, allowing for more nuanced analysis of past credit behaviors and their potential impact on future credit risks.

   Reasoning: By converting the categorical credit_history into numerical labels, this feature can be used alongside other numerical features to analyze trends more effectively, which could help in understanding how past credit behaviors influence creditworthiness.

3. <employment_property_impact><cross><employment><property_magnitude><Evaluates the combined effect of employment status and property ownership, considering both job security and asset stability, providing a comprehensive view of financial health and influencing credit decisions.

   Reasoning: Crossing employment with property_magnitude can highlight how job security is balanced with asset ownership. This holistic view may provide insights into an applicant's financial health and stability, potentially influencing credit determinations.
