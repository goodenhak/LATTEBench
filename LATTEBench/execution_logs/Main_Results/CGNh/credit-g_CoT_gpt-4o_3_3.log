   - This feature aims to explore the risk associated with the credit amount in comparison to the value of the applicant's property, if any. Property ownership often indicates financial stability, and this feature might help in identifying applicants who are overextending themselves financially.

2. <credit_to_income_ratio><divide><credit_amount_log><employment_encoded><Ratio of log-transformed credit amount to employment duration to capture potential credit burden relative to job stability>
   - By examining the relationship between the credit amount and employment duration, this feature attempts to capture the credit burden relative to job stability. A long employment history may suggest reliability, which can be an important factor in assessing credit risk.

3. <aggregate_duration_and_age><plus><duration><age><Aggregate of duration and age to capture lifetime credit responsibility and potential maturity>
   - This feature is designed to consider both the age and the duration of credit as an aggregate measure. It aims to capture how the applicant's age and credit duration might interact to indicate lifetime credit responsibility and potential maturity in handling credit.

   Reasoning: This feature can enhance the model's understanding of the applicant's financial stability by combining savings account status with property ownership, as both attributes strongly indicate available financial resources and risk level.

2. \<employment_and_age_ratio\><divide><employment_encoded><age><Ratio of employment duration to age to assess job stability relative to the applicant's age>
   
   Reasoning: This feature aims to evaluate the balance between employment duration and age, which can provide insights into how stable their employment is for a given age, potentially indicating job security and maturity.

3. \<job_and_property_interaction\><cross><job><property_magnitude><Interaction between job type and property ownership to evaluate the applicant's socio-economic status>

2025-09-03 00:20:43,635 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<credit_duration_ratio\>\<divide\>\<credit_amount\>\<duration\>\<Ratio of credit amount to duration to capture the intensity of credit demand relative to the repayment period\>
   - Reasoning: This feature attempts to capture the financial strain or intensity of the credit asked for in relation to the repayment period. It can help to identify applicants who are asking for large amounts over short periods, potentially indicating higher risk.

2. \<age_property_cross\>\<cross\>\<age\>\<property_magnitude\>\<Combination of age with property ownership to evaluate potential financial maturity and stability\>
   - Reasoning: This feature combines the applicant's age with their property ownership status. An older applicant with significant property might indicate greater financial stability, while a younger applicant with no property could represent a higher risk.

3. \<employment_savings_interaction\>\<cross\>\<employment_encoded\>\<savings_status\>\<Interaction between employment duration and savings account status to capture the potential correlation between job stability and financial savings behavior\>
   - Reasoning: This interaction aims to capture the relationship between how long someone has been employed and their savings status, potentially providing insights into their financial habits and stability. A stable employment history combined with good savings might suggest a lower-risk individual.
