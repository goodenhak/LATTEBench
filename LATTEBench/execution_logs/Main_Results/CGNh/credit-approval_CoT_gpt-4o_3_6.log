   - Reasoning: Exploring the interaction between prior default status and citizenship might reveal unique patterns in credit card applications. Certain citizenship statuses may have inherent risk factors or financial behaviors tied to prior defaults, affecting eligibility.

2. <Income_Sqrt><sqrt><Income><Square_root_transformed_income_to_handle_income_skewness_and_smooth_large_values>
   - Reasoning: The income feature has a large range and high variance, which could skew results. Applying a square root transformation can stabilize the variance and make the model more sensitive to differences in lower income ranges.

3. <Employed_Married_cross><cross><Employed><Married><Interaction_between_employment_and_marital_status_to_capture_relationship_effects_on_credit_card_application_success>
   - Reasoning: Combining employment and marital status in an interaction may unveil correlations with credit card application success. Employment coupled with marital status can influence financial stability and creditworthiness perception, directly impacting approval rates.

Reasoning:

1. Debt to Income Ratio: This feature assesses a person's financial liquidity and relative debt burden, which can be crucial for understanding their ability to repay new debt like a credit card. A higher debt relative to income might be a risk indicator for credit worthiness.

2. Prior Default and Credit Score Interaction: The combination of prior defaults with credit score can give insights into how a history of defaults interacts with current creditworthiness. Those with prior defaults who have managed to increase their credit score might have unique applications compared to others.

3. Industry and Citizenship Interaction: This feature can help capture patterns between different job sectors and citizenship status, potentially revealing sector-specific characteristics affecting credit card approval rates. For instance, certain sectors might have more employment uncertainty for non-citizens.

   Reasoning: Examining debt patterns relative to age could capture insights into financial maturity and behavior over time. This interaction might illustrate how debt levels typically change as individuals age, potentially reflecting financial stability or risk.

2. \<Income_Industry_cross\><cross><Income><Industry><Interaction_between_Income_and_Industry_capturing_earning_patterns_across_different_job_sectors\>

   Reasoning: Income levels significantly vary across different industries. This interaction could capture the financial disparities or earning potential among various sectors. Understanding these patterns can enhance prediction models by linking financial variables to employment sectors.

3. \<ZipCode_Citizen_cross\><cross><ZipCode><Citizen><Interaction_between_ZipCode_and_Citizenship_status_to_capture_geographical_differences_across_citizenship_categories\>

   Reasoning: Geographical location can influence economic opportunities, societal norms, and lifestyle. This interaction attempts to capture potential variations based on residency location and citizenship status, potentially reflecting socio-economic factors unique to particular areas and citizenship categories.

2025-09-21 03:40:08,455 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance for predicting credit card application success, we can generate new features that capture complex interactions and relationships between existing features. Here's how we can go about it:

1. Leverage Existing Success Patterns:
   - <PriorDefault_CreditScore_cross><cross><PriorDefault><CreditScore><Interaction_between_PriorDefault_and_CreditScore_to_assess_creditworthiness_relative_to_historic_default_status_and_credit_score>
     - Reasoning: The combination of a prior default and credit score could effectively capture a person's credit risk profile, highlighting their likelihood of being successful in future credit endeavors.

2. Incorporate Geographical and Citizenship Factors:
   - <ZipCode_Citizen_cross><cross><ZipCode><Citizen><Interaction_between_ZipCode_and_Citizenship_status_to_capture_geographical_and_citizenship_differences>
     - Reasoning: People from certain geographical areas or with specific citizenship statuses might exhibit different credit card application success rates due to socio-economic factors or regional financial norms.

3. Analyze Debt Impact Relative to Income:
   - <Debt_Income_ratio><ratio><Debt><Income><Debt_to_Income_ratio_assessing_financial_liquidity_and_debt_burden_relative_to_income_level>
     - Reasoning: Understanding an individual's debt burden relative to their income can provide insights into their financial health and likelihood of successfully applying for credit cards. People managing their debt well relative to their income might have higher chances of success.

These feature engineering steps attempt to create more nuanced representations of the data that may reveal patterns associated with credit card application success.
