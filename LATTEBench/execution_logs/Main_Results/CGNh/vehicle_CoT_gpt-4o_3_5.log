2025-09-21 13:20:28,975 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features to improve the classification model's performance:

1. \<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO_ZSCORE\><zscore>\<MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO\>\<Standardized version of max length aspect ratio to normalize the scale and potentially reveal underlying patterns related to vehicle types.\>

   Reasoning: Standardizing this feature can help identify unusual values that deviate from the mean, potentially indicating specific vehicle characteristics that differ by type.

2. \<PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO_SQRT\><sqrt>\<PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO\>\<Root of pr.axis aspect ratio to adjust the scale and reduce variability, assisting in distinguishing between different vehicle profiles, especially those with subtle axial differences.\>

   Reasoning: Taking the square root of this feature might reduce skewness and variability, helping to better distinguish between vehicles with similar but distinct profiles.

3. \<KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS_RECIPROCAL\><reciprocal>\<KURTOSIS_ABOUT_MINOR_AXIS\>\<Inverse of kurtosis about minor axis to emphasize flatter distributions, potentially aiding in detecting vehicles with less pronounced shape irregularities.\>

   Reasoning: The reciprocal of kurtosis could highlight flatter (less peaked) distributions of vehicle shapes, helping to differentiate vehicles like vans or buses that have less variation in their cross-sectional profiles.

2025-09-21 13:20:45,827 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps for generating new features to improve the downstream model's performance:

1. 
   - <PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO_MAX.LENGTH_RATIO><ratio><PR.AXIS_ASPECT_RATIO><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><Ratio between pr.axis aspect ratio and max length aspect ratio to highlight axial symmetry relative to length differences, potentially improving vehicle classification based on profile aspect differences.>

   Reasoning: Combining aspect ratios can enhance the model's ability to differentiate vehicle types with subtle profile asymmetries.

2. 
   - <HOLLOWS_RATIO_LOG><log><HOLLOWS_RATIO><Logarithmic transformation of hollows ratio to compress scale differences and emphasize subtle variations in shape complexity, aiding in distinguishing more intricate vehicle shapes like buses and vans.>

   Reasoning: Applying a logarithmic transformation to the hollows ratio could help emphasize minor differences in complex shapes, improving vehicle classification, especially for those with internal voids or complex shapes.

3. 
   - <SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS_MAX.LENGTH_RATIO><ratio><SCALED_VARIANCE_ALONG_MINOR_AXIS><MAX.LENGTH_ASPECT_RATIO><Ratio between scaled variance along minor axis and max length aspect ratio to capture variance differences relative to length features, improving vehicle type differentiation based on variation and silhouette length.>

   Reasoning: This ratio can highlight the relationship between variance and length, which may help discriminate vehicles with different variational characteristics relative to their length, potentially improving classification accuracy.
