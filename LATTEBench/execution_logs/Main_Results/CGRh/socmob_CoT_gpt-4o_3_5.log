You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor, Craftsmen-Other, Craftsman-Construction, Salesman-Retail, Manager, Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Farm_Laborer]

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

2025-11-26 22:27:28,095 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Craftsmen-Other, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Service_Worker, Craftsman-Construction, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Professional-Salaried, Proprietor, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Operative-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Clerk, Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Farm_Laborer]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- fathers_occupation_sons_occupation_cross:  (categorical), categories = [Professional-Salaried_Craftsmen-Other, Service_Worker_Farmer/Farm_Manager, ..., Manager_Laborer-Manufacturing]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- race_counts_for_sons_first_occupation_log_groupbythenstd:  (numerical), range = [4.331954263319622, 7.1207668662268615], Q1 = 4.331954263319622, Median = 4.331954263319622, Q3 = 7.1207668662268615, Mean = 5.7002, Std = 1.3952

Data Examples:
sons_occupation is Craftsmen-Other. family_structure is intact. fathers_occupation_sons_occupation_cross is Salesman-Nonretail_Craftsmen-Other. race is white. race_counts_for_sons_first_occupation_log_groupbythenstd is 4.331954263319622.
