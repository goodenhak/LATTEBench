- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable with binary outcomes used to assess employment stability and residency status (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time of residence at their current address (in years). This numerical feature may indicate stability, as a higher value suggests a longer loan term relative to residential tenure. (numerical)
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label for their savings status. It captures a combined effect where the influence of age on credit risk may be moderated or amplified by the individual's level of savings.
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments. This feature transforms the raw credit burden per installment into a logarithmic scale, which can help normalize the distribution and model the diminishing marginal effect of larger credit obligations.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with four levels: 'no checking account' (<0 DM), 'low balance' (0 <= balance < 200 DM), 'moderate balance' (200 <= balance), and 'high balance or salary assignment' (balance >= 200 DM or accounts for which salaries are assigned). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the scheduled final payment (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including timeliness of payments and any defaults or delinquencies (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: Specific intended use for the requested loan, categorized into types such as new car, used car, education, business, domestic appliances, repairs, or other personal expenses. This feature indicates the risk profile and economic sector associated with the credit application.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, denominated in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset (numerical).
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the applicant's level of savings and assets, which is a key indicator of financial stability and capacity to handle credit. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status expressed as a duration range in years, indicating job stability and length of service with the present employer. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to existing installment payments, such as loans or financing agreements (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as 'male single', 'male married/divorced', 'female divorced/separated/married', or 'female single' (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional parties who have co-signed or guaranteed the loan, acting as a secondary obligor for the credit (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of collateral or assets the applicant has declared for the loan, such as real estate, a car, or life insurance (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans with other banks or stores, indicating the applicant's existing debt obligations and credit behavior with other institutions (categorical)
- housing: Current housing accommodation status of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live in accommodation provided for free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, which indicates their current debt obligations and credit relationship depth with the institution (numerical)
- **job**: Occupation or professional category of the applicant, classified into predefined groups such as unskilled, skilled, or highly skilled (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'. This is a categorical feature that may reflect immigration status and associated employment stability or legal residency considerations. (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the length of time the applicant has resided at their current address, calculated as duration divided by residence_since. This engineered numerical feature may indicate stability, as it compares the loan's term to the applicant's residential tenure. (numerical)
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: A derived numerical feature representing the product of the applicant's age and an encoded label for their savings status. This interaction term may help capture combined financial patterns where age and savings level together influence credit risk. (numerical)
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments. This engineered feature transforms the raw credit-to-installment ratio to a logarithmic scale, which can help normalize the distribution and reduce the influence of extreme values, potentially capturing the relative burden or affordability of the new loan. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the existing checking account, categorized as either '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or other standard categories (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit loan in months (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as 'all paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'existing paid' (existing credits paid duly so far), 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayment), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits with critical payment history or other problematic accounts), or 'no credits taken/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid). (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific types such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, or vacation. This indicates the applicant's financial goal and risk profile associated with that spending category.
- credit_amount: The monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, denominated in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a numerical feature representing the principal sum. (numerical)
- savings_status: Current balance tier of the individual's savings account and bonds, denominated in Deutsche Mark (DM). This feature categorizes the level of liquid savings, which is a key indicator of financial stability and capacity to handle credit obligations. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer). This represents the current burden of fixed, regular payments for debts such as other bank loans or credit purchases (numerical).
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating both marital/legal status (e.g., male single, male div/sep, female div/dep/mar) and gender (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical: e.g., 'none', 'co-applicant', 'guarantor').
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset, used as collateral or an indicator of financial stability. This includes real estate, a life insurance policy, a car, or no known property of value. (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's other concurrent installment plans with banks or stores, which may influence their current credit risk and debt burden (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of accommodation (e.g., rent, own, or for free) (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including loans and credit lines, which indicates their current debt obligations and relationship depth with the institution (numerical)
- job: Occupation or employment type of the applicant, categorized into groups such as unskilled, skilled, or highly qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible values: 'none' for no telephone, or a specific number/identifier if one is present. In the provided dataset, the value is consistently 'none'. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess potential immigration status-related employment stability and residency risk (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as duration divided by residence_since. This engineered feature quantifies the relative commitment length of the loan against the applicant's residential stability. (numerical)
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label for their savings status. This engineered variable captures potential non-linear or combined effects where the impact of age on credit risk may be moderated or amplified by the level of the applicant's savings.
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments. This engineered feature transforms the raw credit-to-installment ratio to reduce skewness and model the diminishing marginal effect of larger loan sizes relative to existing debt obligations. (numerical)
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: (numerical) A composite numerical feature derived from the normalized ratio of loan duration to time at residence, which is then combined with the product of the applicant's age and an encoded representation of their savings status. It synthesizes information on financial commitment stability, age-weighted savings behavior, and residential tenure into a single score.
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the number of existing credits at other banks and the number of dependents the applicant supports. A value of zero indicates the number of dependents is zero (ratio is infinite, log is undefined and set to near-zero), while negative values indicate the applicant has more dependents than existing credits. (numerical)

It is a categorical feature with common tiers indicating the level of savings, such as '<100 DM' for low savings, '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', and '>=1000 DM' for higher savings, as well as 'no known savings' for accounts with unknown or no savings. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years of service: 'unemployed', '<1', '1<=X<4', '4<=X<7', and '>=7'. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex, including categories such as male single, male married or widowed, male divorced or separated, female divorced/separated/married, and female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants or guarantors, which can influence risk assessment by sharing liability (categorical: none, co applicant, guarantor)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical). This feature indicates residential stability, with longer durations often associated with lower perceived risk.
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable owned property or asset, which serves as collateral or an indicator of financial stability. This feature includes categories such as real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property. (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence of other concurrent installment payment plans, specifically those with banks or department stores. A "none" value signifies no other active installment plans, while "stores" indicates at least one existing plan with a store. This feature helps assess the applicant's current debt burden from recurring payments. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including loans and credit lines, which indicates the applicant's existing debt burden and relationship history with the institution (numerical integer)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled and non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled employee or official, or high-qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their own name. This is a categorical feature with two possible states: 'none' for no personal telephone line, or a specific value (e.g., 'yes') if one is registered. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess potential immigration status-related employment stability and residency permanence, which may influence credit risk evaluation (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: (numerical) The ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time of residence at their current address (in years). This engineered feature quantifies the relationship between the loan's repayment timeline and the applicant's residential stability, with higher values potentially indicating a longer loan term relative to a shorter period of residency.
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label for their savings status. It quantifies the combined effect of age and financial reserves, where a higher value may indicate an older applicant with substantial savings or a specific savings category.
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments. This derived feature combines the scale of the loan with the borrower's current installment burden, and the log transformation helps normalize the distribution and reduce the impact of extreme values. (numerical)
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: A derived numerical feature that first calculates the ratio of loan duration to time at residence, standardizes this ratio into a z-score, then adds the product of the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label representing their savings status. It combines temporal, financial, and demographic patterns into a single composite metric. (numerical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the number of existing credits at other banks and the number of dependents. This engineered feature captures the logarithmic-scaled burden of existing debt relative to family size, where a higher positive value indicates more credits per dependent, and a negative value indicates fewer credits than dependents. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized into four levels based on the account balance in Deutsche Mark (DM): 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). This is a strong indicator of financial stability and liquidity. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan agreement from disbursement to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as 'existing paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits not paid duly or other critical status), 'delayed previously' (past delays in credit repayments), 'all paid' (all previous credits paid back), or 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid) (categorical)
- **name: purpose (categorical)**
- **desc:** This feature specifies the intended use of the loan funds. It is a categorical variable that classifies the primary objective for which the credit is being sought, such as acquiring a vehicle, financing education, or starting a business. The category helps assess the risk and alignment of the loan with typical financial patterns for that purpose.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This numerical feature represents the principal sum the individual seeks to borrow. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: '<100 DM' for very low savings, '100<=X<500 DM' for modest savings, '500<=X<1000 DM' for moderate savings, '>=1000 DM' for substantial savings, and 'no known savings' for when no savings or bonds are declared. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment in years. The categories are: '<1' (less than one year), '1<=X<4' (between one and four years), '4<=X<7' (between four and seven years), and '>=7' (seven years or more). (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for existing loans, expressed as an integer categorical value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). This represents the burden of existing fixed periodic debt obligations relative to available income. (ordinal)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex, indicating marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced, widowed) and gender (male/female) of the applicant (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature identifies whether the applicant has co-signers, joint applicants, or other parties who share responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical). This feature indicates residential stability, with longer durations often associated with lower perceived risk.
- property_magnitude: The applicant's most valuable form of collateral or asset, used to secure the credit (categorical)
- age: Age of the individual applicant in whole years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's concurrent installment plans with other institutions, categorized as 'bank', 'stores', or 'none' (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, which influences their perceived debt burden and repayment capacity (numerical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled employee/official, high qualif/self-employed/management, or unemployed/non-resident (categorical)
- num_dependents: The total count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide ongoing maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible values: 'yes' if the applicant has a telephone, or 'none' if they do not. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable used to assess potential stability and residency status in the context of credit risk evaluation (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: (numerical) The ratio of the original loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time of residence at their current address (in years). This engineered feature is calculated by dividing `duration` by `residence_since`. It quantifies the loan term relative to residential stability, where a higher value may indicate a longer financial commitment compared to a shorter period of local establishment.
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label assigned to their savings status. This feature combines two fundamental risk indicators—age (often correlated with financial stability) and savings behavior—into a single composite value that may capture non-linear relationships relevant to creditworthiness assessment.
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments. This feature transforms the raw credit-amount-to-installment ratio to reduce skewness and model the multiplicative relationship on a more linear, normalized scale. (numerical)
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: A derived numerical feature calculated by first taking the ratio of loan duration to time at residence, normalizing this value (z-score), and then adding the product of the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label representing their savings status. It combines temporal, financial, and demographic signals into a single composite metric. (numerical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the number of existing credits at other banks and the number of dependents in the applicant's care. This engineered feature mathematically combines two demographic and financial stability indicators to represent the burden of existing debt relative to family responsibilities, with a log transformation applied to reduce skew and handle cases where the number of dependents is zero. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. These categories indicate the account balance range or lack of an account, and serve as a key indicator of financial liquidity and transaction history. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan agreement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, including timeliness and fulfillment of previous obligations (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: Specifies the intended use of the requested loan, categorized into domains such as new/used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, vacation, retraining, business, or other. This feature is critical for risk assessment as different purposes have varying associated risks, collateral value, and likelihood of generating returns for repayment.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum for which the individual is seeking financial approval. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the approximate balance range: '<100' for less than 100 DM, '100<=X<500' for balances between 100 and 500 DM, '500<=X<1000' for balances between 500 and 1000 DM, '>=1000' for balances of 1000 DM or more, and 'no known savings' when no savings or bonds are declared. (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's checking account, categorized as either a specific monetary range (e.g., '0<=X<200', '<0'), or 'no checking' for no account. (categorical)
- duration: Length of the loan, measured in months. (numerical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past credit behavior, with categories such as 'existing paid' for current credits duly paid, or 'critical/other existing credit' for delayed payments or other critical accounts. (categorical)
- purpose: Intended use for the requested loan, such as 'repairs', 'education', 'radio/tv', or 'new car'. (categorical)
- credit_amount: Total value of the loan requested, in currency units. (numerical)
- savings_status: Level of savings or assets, with categories like '<100' for savings below 100 units, or 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment stability, represented as a categorical range of years (e.g., '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years). (categorical)
- installment_commitment: Monthly installment rate for the loan as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income. (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender, combined into categories such as 'male single' or 'female div/dep/mar' (divorced/separated/married with dependent). (categorical)
- other_parties: Presence of other co-applicants or guarantors, with 'none' indicating no other parties involved. (categorical)
- residence_since: Length of time at current residence, in years. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: Type of property or collateral owned, such as 'car', 'life insurance', or 'real estate'. (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant, in years. (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Existence of other installment plans, with 'none' indicating no other plans. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation, categorized as 'own' for home ownership, 'rent', or 'for free'. (categorical)
- existing_credits: Number of existing credit lines or loans held at this bank. (numerical)
- job: Type of employment, with categories like 'skilled' for skilled employee/official, 'unskilled resident', or 'unemployed'. (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents the applicant supports. (numerical)
- own_telephone: Telephone ownership, with 'yes' indicating a registered telephone in the applicant's name, or 'none' otherwise. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with 'yes' or 'no' as categories. (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: Engineered feature representing the ratio of loan duration to time at current residence. (numerical)
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: Engineered feature resulting from the multiplication of the applicant's age and an encoded numerical representation of their savings status. (numerical)
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: Engineered feature representing the natural logarithm of the ratio of the loan amount to the installment commitment. (numerical)
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: Complex engineered feature combining a z-score normalized duration-residence ratio with the age-savings status multiplication product. (numerical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: Engineered feature representing the natural logarithm of the ratio of the number of existing credits to the number of dependents. (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, including the proposed new loan. This is a critical indicator of debt burden and repayment capacity (numerical).
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as 'male single', 'male mar/wid', 'female div/dep/mar', and others (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional responsible parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address. A higher value may indicate greater residential stability. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's property holdings, such as real estate, a car, or other assets, used to assess financial stability and collateral (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the applicant's existing installment payment plans with other banks or retail stores. This categorical feature reflects prior financial commitments and can signal credit burden or repayment behavior. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, excluding the new credit application being evaluated. This is a discrete numerical value, where a higher number may indicate a greater existing debt burden or more complex credit history with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Employment occupation category of the applicant, such as skilled, unskilled resident, or management/self-employed/highly qualified (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and must provide ongoing support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical: 'none' for no telephone, 'yes' for having a telephone)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no', serving as a categorical variable that may influence credit risk assessment based on residency status (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time of residence at their current address (in years). This numerical feature represents how many times longer the loan term is compared to the applicant's residential stability. A higher value may indicate a longer-term financial commitment relative to their established local tenure. (numerical)
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label for their savings status. This feature captures potential non-linear relationships where the effect of age on credit risk may be amplified or moderated by the individual's level of savings.
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments. This engineered feature transforms the raw credit-to-installment ratio to reduce skewness and model the diminishing marginal effect of larger loan sizes relative to existing debt obligations.
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: (numerical) A composite engineered feature. It is calculated by first taking the ratio of the loan duration to the applicant's time at their current residence (`duration_residence_since_divide`), normalizing this ratio into a Z-score, and then adding the product of the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label representing their savings status (`age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply`). This feature combines temporal, financial stability, and demographic information into a single metric.
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the number of existing credits at other banks and the number of dependents in the applicant's care. This engineered feature captures the interaction between existing financial obligations and family responsibilities, where a higher value indicates a greater burden of credit relative to dependents. A log transformation is applied to reduce skew and handle cases where the number of dependents is zero by using a near-zero placeholder. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '>=200' (high positive balance), or 'no checking account'. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan repayment period (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as 'existing paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'critical/other existing credit' (delayed payments or other problematic credit history), 'all paid' (all credits at this bank paid duly), or 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid duly) (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: Specifies the intended use of the requested loan, representing categories such as a new or used car, furniture/equipment, business investment, education, or other defined purposes. This feature is critical for assessing risk by linking the loan's objective to its expected financial outcome and likelihood of repayment.
- credit_amount: The monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, denominated in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This is a continuous numerical feature representing the principal sum. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the total level of savings and investments. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges indicating years of service: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to repaying existing installment debts, including the proposed loan. This is a critical indicator of debt burden and repayment capacity (numerical).
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as male single, male married or widowed, female divorced/separated/married, or male divorced/separated (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial support or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or collateral, which serves as a key indicator of asset-backed security for the credit. The categories are: 'real estate' (property such as land or buildings), 'life insurance' (an active life insurance policy with savings value), 'car' (an automobile), or 'no known property' (no significant assets declared). (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's existing installment plans with other institutions, such as banks or retail stores. This indicates whether the applicant has concurrent, outstanding installment debt elsewhere, which can affect their overall debt burden and repayment capacity. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including the one being applied for (numerical integer)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled, high qualif/self emp/mgmt, or unemp/non-resident (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of people, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Whether the applicant has a registered telephone line. This is a categorical feature with values 'yes' for having a telephone, or 'none' for not having one. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable with two possible states: 'yes' for foreign workers or 'no' for domestic workers (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time of residence at their current address (in years). A higher value indicates a relatively long loan term compared to a short residential stability, which may be associated with higher risk. (numerical)
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: A derived numerical feature representing the product of the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label assigned to their savings status. This multiplicative interaction aims to capture the combined influence of age and financial reserves on credit risk. (numerical)
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments. This feature transforms the raw credit burden per existing installment into a logarithmic scale, which helps normalize the distribution and reduce the impact of extreme values, potentially revealing a more stable relationship with the target variable. (numerical)
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: (numerical) A composite feature engineered by first calculating the ratio of loan duration to time at residence, normalizing this ratio into a z-score, and then adding it to the product of the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label representing their savings status. It combines temporal, financial stability, and demographic information into a single metric.
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the number of existing credits the applicant holds and the number of dependents they support. This engineered feature mathematically transforms the raw ratio to reduce skewness and handle cases where the number of dependents is zero or one, helping to model potential non-linear relationships with credit risk. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance level: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). This is a key indicator of short-term financial liquidity. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from origination to the scheduled final payment (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment punctuality and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include, but are not limited to, 'radio/tv' (for electronics/appliances), 'new car' (for automotive purchases), 'used car', 'furniture/equipment', 'business', 'education', 'repairs', and 'domestic appliances'. It is a key indicator of risk and loan performance, as certain purposes (e.g., business) may have different default probabilities compared to others (e.g., car loans).

- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration ranges: unemployed or less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. This feature reflects job stability and is represented as an ordinal categorical variable. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the requested credit, expressed as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income. This represents the fixed, recurring financial obligation the applicant commits to if the loan is approved. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex, including categories such as male single, female divorced/separated/married, male married/widowed, and female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors. This categorical feature assesses shared liability and third-party backing for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type and relative value of the applicant's primary collateral or asset, categorized as real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical).
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's existing installment plans with other institutions, specifically banks or retail stores. This indicates whether the applicant has concurrent, outstanding installment debt obligations elsewhere. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value represents the applicant's current active credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Employment occupation category, including skilled, unskilled resident, high qualif/self emp/mgmt, and unskilled/non-resident (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized into ranges such as no checking, <0, or 0<=X<200, indicating the balance level and associated risk (categorical)
- duration: Length of the loan or credit arrangement in months, representing the time commitment for repayment (numerical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past behavior with credit, including categories like 'existing paid' for current credits duly paid, reflecting reliability (categorical)
- purpose: Intended use of the requested credit, such as 'new car' or 'radio/tv', indicating the loan's purpose (categorical)
- credit_amount: Total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant (numerical)
- savings_status: Level of savings or bonds held by the applicant, with categories like '<100' or 'no known savings' (categorical)
- employment: Applicant's current employment status, represented in categories like 'unemployed' or ranges such as '1<=X<4' for years employed (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The installment rate or percentage of the applicant's disposable income dedicated to debt repayment (numerical)
- personal_status: Applicant's personal details including gender and marital status, such as 'male single' or 'male mar/wid' (categorical)
- other_parties: Presence of other parties like guarantors or co-applicants involved in the credit application (categorical)
- residence_since: Duration in years that the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: Type and scale of the applicant's property holdings, such as 'real estate' or 'no known property' (categorical)
- age: Applicant's age in years at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Existence of other payment plans or installment agreements with institutions like banks (categorical)
- housing: Applicant's current housing situation, categorized as 'own', 'rent', or similar (categorical)
- existing_credits: Count of existing credit lines or loans currently held by the applicant at other institutions (numerical)
- job: Classification of the applicant's employment type or skill level, such as 'high qualif/self emp/mgmt' or 'skilled' (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of individuals, typically children or relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone in their name, with values like 'yes' or 'none' (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Binary indicator specifying if the applicant is a foreign worker, typically 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: Derived feature representing the ratio of loan duration to years at current residence, potentially normalized or scaled (numerical)
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: Engineered feature combining age and encoded savings status through multiplication (numerical)
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: Transformed feature from the logarithm of the ratio between credit amount and installment commitment (numerical)
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: Complex engineered feature incorporating z-score normalization and additive combination of multiple base features (numerical)
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: Derived feature from the logarithm of the ratio between number of existing credits and number of dependents (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical: 'none' for no telephone, 'yes' for having a telephone)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, which is a categorical variable typically used to assess residency status and potential employment stability (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: (numerical) The ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's time of residence at their current address (in years). This engineered feature represents the relative scale of the loan term compared to residential stability, where higher values may indicate a longer-term commitment relative to a shorter period of established residency.
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label for their savings status. This feature combines two fundamental risk indicators: age (often correlated with financial stability) and savings (a direct measure of financial buffer), to capture their non-linear, combined effect on creditworthiness.
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: (numerical) The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments. This engineered feature transforms the raw credit-to-installment ratio to reduce skewness and model the diminishing marginal effect of larger loan sizes relative to existing debt obligations, potentially capturing an applicant's debt burden capacity on a more normalized scale.
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: (numerical) A derived feature representing the sum of a z-score normalized version of the ratio between loan duration and time at residence (`duration_residence_since_divide`) and the product of the applicant's age and an encoded label for their savings status (`age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply`). This composite feature aims to capture a combined risk profile influenced by the stability of the applicant's duration/residence ratio (normalized for scale) and a savings-capacity indicator weighted by age.
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the number of existing credits the applicant holds and the number of dependents they have. This engineered feature mathematically transforms the raw ratio to help normalize its distribution and reduce the impact of extreme values, often making patterns more linear and interpretable for the model.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '>=200' (high positive balance), or 'no checking' (no account). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan period from disbursement to the final scheduled payment (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, including timeliness and fulfillment of previous credit obligations (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: Specifies the intended use of the requested loan, categorized into types such as new car, used car, education, business, or other defined classes, which helps assess the risk and legitimacy of the credit application.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This numerical feature represents the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and greater than or equal to 1000 DM. This feature reflects the applicant's available liquid assets and financial reserves. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years: unemployed (<1 year), 1<=X<4 years, 4<=X<7 years, and >=7 years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the loan, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the relative burden of the loan payment on the borrower's available monthly funds. (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, including categories such as 'male single', 'male mar/wid', 'female div/dep/mar', and 'female single' (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party security associated with the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: Type and scale of the applicant's most valuable owned property or collateral (categorical)
- age: Age of the individual applicant in whole years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the presence of other concurrent installment payment plans with banks or stores, which may impact the applicant's overall debt burden and repayment capacity (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live for free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines the applicant currently has open with this specific bank, excluding the loan being applied for. This numerical value represents the applicant's current active credit burden at the institution. (numerical)
- job: Current employment type or occupational category of the applicant, indicating their professional status and skill level (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible values: 'yes' if the applicant has a telephone, or 'none' if they do not. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker (yes) or a domestic worker (no), which may be associated with different employment stability and credit risk profiles (categorical)
- duration_residence_since_divide: The result of dividing the original loan duration (in months) by the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence, calculated as duration / residence_since. This engineered feature represents the monthly loan burden relative to residential stability, where a higher value may indicate a longer-term financial commitment compared to a short period of established residency. (numerical)
- age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and an encoded numerical representation of their savings status. It quantifies the combined effect of age and financial stability, where a higher value may indicate an older applicant with substantial savings or a specific savings category assigned a larger encoded weight.
- credit_amount_installment_commitment_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the number of existing installment commitments, representing the log-scaled burden of the new loan relative to current installment obligations. (numerical)
- duration_residence_since_divide_zscore_age_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_plus: (numerical) A composite engineered feature that first calculates the ratio of loan duration to time at residence, then standardizes this ratio into a z-score. This z-score is subsequently added to the product of the applicant's age and an encoded numerical label representing their savings status. The feature combines temporal, financial stability, and demographic information into a single metric.
- existing_credits_num_dependents_ratio_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the number of existing credits held by the applicant and the number of dependents they support. This engineered feature helps normalize the relationship between credit burden and family responsibilities, where a higher value indicates a greater credit load relative to dependents. (numerical)
