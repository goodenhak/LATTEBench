You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the agreed-upon repayment period for the loan (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the approximate balance level and is categorized as: 'no known savings' (no account or bonds), '<100' (balance under 100 DM), '100<=X<500' (balance between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000' (balance between 500 and 999 DM), or '>=1000' (balance of 1000 DM or more). (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the loan funds. Categories include, but are not limited to, education, furniture/equipment, business, new car, used car, domestic appliances, repairs, vacation, retraining, and other specific or general purposes.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges such as unemployed, less than 1 year, between 1 and 4 years, between 4 and 7 years, or 7 years and above. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, combining marital and gender information into categories such as 'male single', 'female div/dep/mar', 'male mar/wid', or 'female single' (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is currently obligated to repay. This is a count of concurrent credit lines with regular payment schedules. (integer)
- checking_status_duration_concat: (categorical) A concatenated feature combining an applicant's checking account status and the loan duration in months. It represents the interaction between the applicant's short-term financial liquidity and the proposed length of the credit obligation. The checking status portion indicates the balance level (e.g., 'no checking', '0<=X<200'), while the appended duration is the loan term. This combined value is used to assess risk based on the stability of the applicant's funds over the specific repayment period.
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of external financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant (categorical). Categories include: unskilled resident, skilled employee/official, high qualif/self-employed/management, and unemployed.
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence. A higher value may indicate greater stability. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset, which serves as a form of collateral or financial security (categorical)
- credit_amount_residence_since_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the total credit amount divided by the applicant's duration of residence at their current address. This engineered feature combines financial scale and residential stability into a single numerical value, where a higher number typically indicates a larger credit request relative to a shorter period of residential tenure. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including payment punctuality and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible values: 'yes' for those with a telephone, and 'none' for those without one. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including loans and credit lines (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature with two possible states: 'yes' for foreign workers and 'no' for domestic workers. (categorical)

Data Examples:

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the approximate financial buffer the applicant holds in liquid or near-liquid assets. (categorical)
- name: purpose  
  desc: The specific intended use of the requested credit, categorized into common loan purposes such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, vacation, retraining, business, or other. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum whose risk is being assessed. (numerical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced/separated/widowed) combined with gender (male or female) as a single categorical variable (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, representing ongoing financial liabilities (numerical)
- checking_status_duration_concat: (categorical) A concatenated feature combining the applicant's checking account status and the loan duration in months. The checking status (e.g., '<0', '0<=X<200', 'no checking') is directly joined with the duration value to form a single categorical descriptor of the applicant's financial liquidity relative to the loan term.
- other_parties: Specifies whether there are additional individuals or entities, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This indicates the level of third-party financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- job: The applicant's occupational category, which may influence income stability and credit reliability. Categories include unskilled and non-resident, unskilled resident, skilled employee or official, and highly qualified employee or officer. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address. This is a measure of residential stability. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's property used as collateral or as an indicator of wealth, such as 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property' (categorical)
- credit_amount_residence_since_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the credit amount divided by the duration of residence at the current address. This engineered feature combines and scales two key financial and stability indicators to potentially capture a non-linear relationship between loan size, borrower stability, and risk. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, categorized into groups such as 'all paid' (all previous credits paid back duly), 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayments), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits at other institutions or a critical credit history), 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid duly), or 'existing paid' (existing credits paid back duly up to now) (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name. This is a categorical feature with potential values such as 'yes' for having a telephone, or 'none' for no telephone line. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held and being serviced by the applicant at this specific bank, including the present loan application. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current active credit burden with the institution. (integer)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, specifically defined as a non-resident or non-citizen worker in the country where the credit is being applied for (categorical)

This feature describes the intended use of the loan funds, with categories including, but not limited to, radio/television, furniture/equipment, business, used car, new car, domestic appliances, repairs, education, retraining, and other specific or general purposes.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a key numerical indicator of the financial scale of the request. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges: unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as 'male single', 'female div/dep/mar', 'male mar/wid', or 'female single' (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, including the proposed new loan. This is a key indicator of debt burden and repayment capacity. (numerical)
- checking_status_duration_concat: (categorical) A concatenated feature combining the applicant's checking account status and the duration of the loan in months. It encodes both the financial liquidity indicator (e.g., 'no checking', '<0', '0<=X<200') and the loan term as a single categorical value, representing the interaction between these two risk factors.
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are other parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- job: Employment occupation category of the applicant, which can be unskilled resident, unskilled foreigner, skilled employee/official, or highly qualified/self-employed/management professional (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of valuable property or collateral offered by the applicant, such as real estate, a car, or other assets, used to assess financial security (categorical)
- credit_amount_residence_since_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the total credit amount divided by the number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence. This engineered feature combines financial scale and residential stability into a single numerical value, where a higher result indicates either a larger loan request relative to a short residency or a standard loan relative to a long, stable residency. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and any outstanding credit issues (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including loans and credit lines (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'. This is a categorical feature relevant for assessing employment stability and residency status. (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the agreed-upon loan repayment period (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or account conditions: '<100 DM' (less than 100 DM in savings), '100<=X<500' (savings between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000' (savings between 500 and 999 DM), '>=1000' (savings of 1000 DM or more), and 'no known savings' (no savings accounts or bonds, or no information available). (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include, but are not limited to, new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, and other specific or general purposes.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a continuous numerical variable representing the principal sum. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment duration, categorized into specific ranges: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male div/sep, female div/dep/mar, and male mar/wid (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer)
- checking_status_duration_concat: A categorical feature formed by concatenating the applicant's checking account status with the loan duration. It combines the categories from 'checking_status' (e.g., 'no checking', '0<=X<200') with the numerical 'duration' value to create a composite identifier representing both the financial standing and the loan term in a single field. (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application, indicating shared responsibility for repayment (categorical)
- job: Occupation of the applicant, categorized by skill level and type (e.g., unskilled, skilled, highly skilled) (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of valuable property or collateral the applicant possesses, which can influence credit risk assessment. Options include: real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property. (categorical)
- credit_amount_residence_since_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the total credit amount divided by the duration of residence at the current address, representing the logarithmic financial burden relative to residential stability. (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'all paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'existing paid' (existing credits paid duly so far), 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayments), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits with critical account history or other problematic status), and 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid). (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value reflects the applicant's current debt obligations and credit activity with the institution. (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan agreement or installment plan (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or conditions: 'no known savings' (no verifiable savings), '<100' (less than 100 DM), '100<=X<500' (between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000' (between 500 and 999 DM), and '>=1000' (1000 DM or more). (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- desc: The specific intended use for which the credit loan is being requested by the applicant. This feature categorizes the primary objective or planned expenditure driving the need for financing.
- purpose: To classify the loan's end-use into distinct categories such as a new car, used car, home appliance, business venture, education, or other personal expenses, which is critical for assessing the loan's risk profile and alignment with lending policies.
- credit_amount: The total amount of credit requested by the applicant in Deutsche Marks (DM), representing the principal loan sum before interest (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of current employment in years. The categories are: unemployed (no current employment), <1 (less than one year), 1<=X<4 (between one and less than four years), 4<=X<7 (between four and less than seven years), and >=7 (seven years or more). (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex, including categories such as male single, male married/widowed, male divorced/separated, and female divorced/separated/married (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly obligation for existing installment loans, expressed as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income. This represents the fixed portion of income already committed to debt repayment before the new loan is considered. (numerical)
- checking_status_duration_concat: (categorical) A concatenated feature combining an applicant's checking account status and the duration of the loan in months. It is represented as a string where the checking status prefix (e.g., '0<=X<200', '<0', 'no checking') is directly joined with the numerical duration (e.g., '60', '24'). This creates composite categories that capture the interaction between the applicant's available liquidity and the loan term, such as '0<=X<20060' or '<015'.
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- job: Occupation of the applicant, categorized by skill level and type (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of valuable property owned or offered as collateral by the applicant, which serves as an indicator of asset security and financial stability (categorical)
- credit_amount_residence_since_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the credit amount divided by the duration of residence at the current address. This is a derived numerical feature that normalizes the loan size relative to the applicant's residential stability, often used to capture the relative burden or risk of the loan. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, including timeliness and defaults (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this bank, including all active loans and credit lines (numerical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, specifically meaning they are not a citizen of the country where the credit is being applied for (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_duration_concat: A categorical feature formed by concatenating the original 'checking_status' and 'duration' features. It represents specific combinations of an applicant's account status (e.g., "<0", "no checking") and the loan duration in months (e.g., "12", "24", "30"), providing a joint view of financial standing and loan term. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts or bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>= 1000 DM', or 'no known savings' if no such accounts exist. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested or loaned, denominated in Deutsche Marks for this dataset. It represents the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- **name**: purpose (categorical)  
- **purpose**: Specifies the intended use or objective for which the credit loan is being requested. This categorical feature describes the primary good, service, or investment the borrowed funds are meant to finance, such as a vehicle, household items, business equipment, or education.
- duration_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_zscore: A derived numerical feature representing the product of the encoded categorical interaction between the loan duration and the applicant's savings status, subsequently standardized using a Z-score transformation. This composite metric quantifies the combined, normalized influence of the loan term and financial reserves on the credit risk assessment. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges in years: less than 1 year, 1 to under 4 years, 4 to under 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- credit_amount_residence_since_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the credit amount divided by the duration of residence at the current address, representing a normalized ratio of financial obligation to residential stability. (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for existing loans, expressed as an integer ordinal value (e.g., 1 = <20%, 2 = 20% to <25%, 3 = 25% to <35%, 4 = >=35%) (ordinal numerical)
- employment_checking_status_duration_concat_cross_label_encode_sqrt: A numerical feature derived from a multi-step transformation. It begins by concatenating the raw 'employment' and 'checking_status_duration_concat' features. This combined string is then converted into a numerical label through encoding. Finally, the square root is applied to the resulting encoded value to normalize its distribution. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical). A higher value may indicate greater stability.
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature specifies whether there are co-applicants, guarantors, or if the application is solely individual. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as male single, male married/divorced, female divorced/separated/married, or female single (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines the applicant currently has open at this same bank, excluding the one being applied for (numerical)
- job: Occupation or employment type of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled employee/official, or highly qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The magnitude or category of the applicant's existing property or collateral, which can include real estate, a life insurance policy, a car, or no known property (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, which is a categorical variable with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status_duration_concat: (categorical) A concatenated feature derived from the applicant's checking account status and the loan duration. It combines categorical ranges for checking account balances (e.g., '<0', '0<=X<200', '>=200') with the numerical duration of the loan, creating a composite category that represents the interaction between the applicant's available liquidity and the loan's term length.
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit arrangement (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account and bonds held by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the approximate total balance into tiers: 'no known savings' indicates no verifiable savings, '<100 DM' represents a minimal balance, '100 <= X < 500 DM' and '500 <= X < 1000 DM' indicate low to moderate savings, and '>=1000 DM' signifies substantial savings. This is a key indicator of financial stability and liquidity. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset (numerical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific domains such as business investment, personal consumption, or asset acquisition (e.g., radio/tv, furniture/equipment, new car, used car, business, education, repairs, domestic appliances, vacation, retraining, or other).
- duration_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_zscore: (numerical) A derived feature representing the product of the encoded categorical values for 'duration' and 'savings_status', which has subsequently been normalized using a Z-score transformation. This composite metric captures the interaction between the loan term and the applicant's savings level, standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one within the dataset.
- employment: Current length of employment, categorized into ranges of years: '<1' (less than one year), '1<=X<4' (between one and under four years), '4<=X<7' (between four and under seven years), and '>=7' (seven years or more). (categorical)
- credit_amount_residence_since_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the credit amount divided by the duration of the applicant's residence at their current address. This numerical feature transforms the raw ratio to mitigate the influence of extreme values and better capture the relative scale of the loan compared to residential stability. (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for existing loans, expressed as an integer categorical value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) (ordinal)
- employment_checking_status_duration_concat_cross_label_encode_sqrt: A numerical feature derived from a multi-step transformation. First, the categorical 'checking_status' and numerical 'duration' features are concatenated. This combined value is then cross-referenced with the categorical 'employment' feature to create a complex interaction label. This label is subsequently encoded into a numerical representation. Finally, the square root is applied to this encoded value to reduce skewness and normalize its distribution. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has registered a telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with two possible values: 'yes' for having a telephone, or 'none' for no registered telephone. (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies whether there are additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature indicates the level of third-party financial commitment or security for the loan. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, combining marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced/separated) and gender (male, female) into a single categorical variable (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, representing their current debt obligations with the institution (numerical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, unskilled non-resident, skilled employee, or high qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of valuable property or collateral offered by the applicant, such as real estate, a car, or savings account/life insurance, with a specific category indicating no known property (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
