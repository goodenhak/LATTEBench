You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range or status: 'no checking' (no account), '<0 DM' (negative balance), '0<=X<200 DM' (low positive balance), and '>=200 DM' (healthy balance). This feature reflects immediate liquidity and financial stability. (categorical)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's checking account, categorized as 'no checking', '0<=X<200', '<0', or '>=200' (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the loan in months (numerical)
- credit_history: Applicant's previous credit history, with categories such as 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', or 'critical/other existing credit' (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and any delinquencies (categorical)
- **purpose**: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature indicates the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include, but are not limited to, radio/television, furniture/equipment, used car, new car, business, education, repairs, domestic appliances, and retraining.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the approximate balance range: '<100 DM', '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges representing years of service: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to repaying existing installment loans, such as for a car or appliance, expressed as a numerical value. This rate indicates the borrower's existing fixed monthly debt obligations relative to their available income. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male divorced/separated, male married/widowed, and female single, divorced/separated, or married (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the involvement of additional parties who have co-signed or guaranteed the loan, serving as secondary sources of repayment (categorical: 'none', 'guarantor', or other specified co-debtor categories).
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence. A shorter duration may indicate higher residential instability. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type and scale of the applicant's most valuable collateral or asset, used to secure the loan (categorical). Examples include real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property.
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their current biological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's existing installment plans with other institutions, such as banks or retail stores (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their living arrangement and tenure type (e.g., renting, owning, or living rent-free) (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current active credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Employment occupation classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled, high qualif/self emp/mgmt, or unemployed (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, including children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature with two possible states: 'yes' if the individual is a non-resident or foreign national worker, or 'no' if they are a domestic worker (binary categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the intended loan duration, calculated by dividing the credit amount by the duration in months. This feature represents the monthly financial burden or the average monthly principal if the loan were evenly amortized, with higher values indicating larger required monthly outlays relative to the loan term. (numerical)
- age_existing_credits_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to their number of existing credit accounts, calculated by dividing age by existing_credits. This engineered feature may help capture the relationship between life stage and current credit burden. (numerical)
- **installment_commitment_residence_since_plus**: (numerical) A derived feature representing the sum of the number of existing installment commitments and the duration (in years) the applicant has lived at their current residence. This feature may indicate stability and existing financial obligations, where higher values could suggest a greater combined burden of recurring payments and shorter residential tenure.
- credit_amount_duration_multiply_credit_amount_sqrt_divide: A derived numerical feature calculated by first multiplying the original credit amount by the loan duration, then multiplying that result by the square root of the original credit amount, and finally dividing the total by 100. This complex interaction term aims to capture non-linear relationships between the credit size, its duration, and their combined economic weight. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_multiply_savings_status_label_encode_divide: A derived numerical feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and their duration of residence, subsequently divided by an encoded numerical representation of their savings account status. This feature captures complex, non-linear relationships between these three fundamental attributes—financial stability (savings), life stage (age), and residential stability—which may collectively influence credit risk. (numerical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in categorical ranges of Deutsche Mark (DM) balances or account status. Categories include: 'no checking' (no account), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), '>=200' (high positive balance), and '<0' (negative balance/overdraft). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from origination to the scheduled final payment (numerical)
- credit_history: Records of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including the timeliness of repayments and any outstanding debts (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)  
- desc: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific types of goods, services, or investments. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial objective for the credit, such as acquiring a vehicle, home appliances, or funding education.  
- purpose: To classify the loan's intended use, which helps in assessing risk by evaluating the volatility, necessity, and resale value of the underlying asset or goal.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges: no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, or 1000 DM and more. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the requested loan, expressed as a fixed percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the ongoing financial obligation relative to the borrower's available monthly earnings after essential expenses. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced/separated) combined with gender (male, female), which may influence perceived financial stability and risk (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category describing the applicant's most valuable property or asset, used as security for the credit. This includes real estate, a car, life insurance, or the absence of known property. (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant at the time of the credit application, represented as a continuous numerical integer value. (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, categorized as 'bank' (for plans from banks), 'stores' (for retail or store credit plans), or 'none' (indicating no other active installment plans) (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, excluding the credit being applied for in this instance. This is a discrete numerical value that reflects the applicant's current indebtedness to the institution. (numerical)
- job: Current occupational category of the applicant, indicating skill level and employment sector (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents or individuals for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support, such as children or other relatives (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no'; this is a categorical feature that may reflect stability, residency status, or regulatory considerations in credit assessment. (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the intended loan duration in months. This feature represents the average monthly financial burden of the loan principal before interest. (numerical)
- age_existing_credits_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to their number of existing credit lines, calculated by dividing age by existing_credits. This engineered feature may help capture the relationship between life stage and current credit obligations. (numerical)
- installment_commitment_residence_since_plus: (numerical) A derived feature calculated as the sum of the number of existing installment commitments and the applicant's duration of residence at the current address. This value represents a combined stability and existing obligation metric, where a higher number may indicate greater financial commitments paired with longer-term residential stability.
- credit_amount_duration_multiply_credit_amount_sqrt_divide: A derived numerical feature calculated by first multiplying the original credit amount by the loan duration, then multiplying that result by the square root of the original credit amount, and finally dividing the entire product by the loan duration. It represents a complex interaction term that scales the credit amount non-linearly with respect to time. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_multiply_savings_status_label_encode_divide: A derived numerical feature representing the product of the applicant's age and their duration of residence at the current address, divided by an encoded numerical representation of their savings account status. This composite metric potentially captures the interaction between an applicant's life stage stability (age and residence stability) and their financial prudence (savings), where a higher value may indicate greater combined stability and savings strength. (numerical)

- age_residence_since_multiply_savings_status_label_encode_divide: A derived numerical feature calculated by first multiplying the applicant's age by the number of years they have lived at their current residence, then dividing that product by an encoded numerical representation of their savings account status. This engineered metric potentially captures the interaction between an applicant's life stage stability (age and residence duration) and their financial preparedness (savings), with higher values generally indicating greater stability relative to savings behavior. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the scheduled final payment (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, categorized as 'no credits/all paid', 'all existing credits paid as agreed', 'existing credits paid until now', 'delayed previously', or 'critical/other existing credit' (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: Specifies the intended use of the requested loan, categorized into distinct types such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation, or retraining. This feature is critical for risk assessment as different purposes have varying levels of necessity, collateral value, and historical default rates.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested or granted, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the approximate balance range: '<100 DM', '100 <= ... < 500 DM', '500 <= ... < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to repaying existing installment debts, including the proposed new loan. This is a critical measure of debt burden and repayment capacity (numerical).
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/divorced, female single, or female married/divorced/separated (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors. Categories include 'none' for no other parties, 'guarantor' for a third-party guarantor, and 'co applicant' for a joint applicant. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The type and scale of the applicant's most valuable pledged asset or collateral, categorized as real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Indicates the applicant's existing installment payment plans with other institutions, such as banks or retail stores. This categorical feature reflects the applicant's current debt obligations outside of the loan being applied for, which can influence their overall credit burden and repayment risk. (categorical)
- housing: Type of current housing accommodation, categorized as rent (tenant paying for accommodation), own (owner-occupied property), or for free (living without direct housing costs) (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, excluding the one being applied for. This numerical value represents the applicant's current active credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Job type of the applicant, categorized by skill level and employment sector (e.g., unskilled, skilled, or management). (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, including children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature with two possible states: 'yes' if the applicant is a foreign worker, or 'no' if the applicant is a domestic worker. This feature may be relevant for assessing risk profiles based on employment stability or regulatory considerations. (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the loan duration in months. This feature represents the average monthly financial burden or exposure of the loan principal. (numerical)
- age_existing_credits_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to their number of existing credit accounts, calculated as age divided by existing_credits. This engineered feature may help capture the relationship between life stage (age) and current credit burden. (numerical)
- **installment_commitment_residence_since_plus**: A derived numerical feature representing the sum of the number of existing installment commitments and the duration (in years) the applicant has lived at their current residence. This feature may indicate stability and existing financial obligations, with higher values suggesting a longer residential tenure combined with more active credit installments. (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_multiply_credit_amount_sqrt_divide: A derived numerical feature representing the result of multiplying the total credit amount by the loan duration, then dividing by the square root of the credit amount. This complex ratio combines scale, term, and amount into a single metric that may help capture non-linear interactions between credit size and repayment period, normalized by the amount's magnitude. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_multiply_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature representing the product of the applicant's age and their duration of residence at the current address, divided by the encoded numerical value of their savings account status. This composite metric potentially captures the interaction between an applicant's stability (through age and residence length) and their financial preparedness (through savings), with higher values generally indicating greater combined stability and savings.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_amount_duration_multiply_credit_amount_sqrt_divide: (numerical) A derived feature calculated by first multiplying the credit amount by the loan duration, then dividing the result by the square root of the credit amount. This value combines the scale of the total financial obligation (credit_amount * duration) with a normalization factor based on the original loan size, potentially representing a weighted risk or burden metric.
- checking_status_label_encode_credit_history_label_encode_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature created by crossing the encoded categories of `checking_status` and `credit_history`. Each unique combination represents a specific joint condition of the applicant's checking account status and their historical credit repayment behavior, which may reveal interaction effects not captured by the individual features alone.
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. It indicates the balance level and can reflect financial stability and liquidity. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account and bonds, indicating the approximate balance held in Deutsche Mark. Categories represent specific monetary ranges or account conditions: '<100' (less than 100 DM), '100<=X<500' (between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000' (between 500 and 999 DM), '>=1000' (1000 DM or more), and 'no known savings' (no savings account or bonds). (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: (numerical) The ratio of the total credit amount to the loan duration in months. This feature represents the average monthly financial burden or repayment amount for the loan, with higher values indicating larger required monthly payments relative to the loan term.
- credit_amount_duration_divide_savings_status_label_encode_subtract_reciprocal: (numerical) The reciprocal of the difference between the ratio of credit amount to loan duration and the encoded label for savings status. This engineered feature mathematically combines repayment burden (credit per month), savings level, and their inverse relationship, where a higher value indicates a smaller difference between monthly obligation and savings category.
- purpose: Specific intended use of the requested loan funds, categorized into discrete classes such as 'new car', 'used car', 'furniture/equipment', 'radio/tv', 'domestic appliances', 'repairs', 'education', 'retraining', 'business', or 'others' (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and any previous delinquencies or defaults (categorical: 'no credits taken/all paid', 'all paid', 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', or 'critical/other existing credit')
- duration: Duration in months for the credit loan, representing the agreed repayment period (numerical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant at the time of the credit application, representing a numerical integer value (numerical)
- age_residence_since_multiply_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature representing the product of the applicant's age and their duration of residence at the current address, which is then divided by the numerical label encoding of their savings account status. This composite metric potentially captures an interaction effect between stability (age and residence) and financial preparedness (savings), where a higher value may indicate a more established and financially secure profile.
- age_existing_credits_divide_age_subtract_abs: The absolute difference between the applicant's age and the result of dividing their age by their number of existing credit accounts. This engineered feature captures the relative discrepancy between the applicant’s age and a scaled version of it based on their current credit commitments, with the absolute value ensuring the magnitude of deviation is represented regardless of direction. (numerical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of third-party support for the credit application, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, categorized as 'none', 'guarantor', or 'co-applicant' (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male div/sep, female div/dep/mar, and female single (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or collateral offered by the applicant to secure the credit, which influences risk assessment (categorical)
- age_existing_credits_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to their number of existing credit accounts, calculated by dividing age by existing_credits. This feature may indicate financial burden or credit experience density relative to life stage. (numerical)
- job: Occupation or employment type of the applicant, categorized by skill level and responsibility (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name, which can serve as a point of contact and a marker of stability (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'; this is a categorical feature that may reflect employment stability or regulatory risk (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: The status of any other concurrent installment plans (e.g., with banks or department stores) held by the applicant, which may indicate existing debt obligations and repayment burden (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_amount_duration_multiply_credit_amount_sqrt_divide: (numerical) A derived feature calculated by first multiplying the credit amount by the loan duration, then dividing the result by the square root of the credit amount. This complex transformation combines the scale of the loan, its repayment period, and a normalization factor, potentially capturing the interaction between loan size and term length relative to the base loan amount.
- checking_status_label_encode_credit_history_label_encode_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between the encoded checking account status and the encoded credit history. Each value is a string concatenation (e.g., "0_1" or "3_3") where the first part corresponds to the label-encoded checking status and the second part corresponds to the label-encoded credit history, capturing potential non-linear relationships between these two fundamental financial attributes.
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) categories. It indicates the account balance level and is a critical factor for assessing financial stability. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with the following possible levels: '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', and 'no known savings'. This indicates the applicant's level of liquid assets and financial reserves. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum whose repayment risk is being assessed.
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the total requested credit amount to the planned loan duration in months. This feature represents the average monthly financial burden of the loan principal if repaid linearly, serving as a normalized measure of credit density per payment period. (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_savings_status_label_encode_subtract_reciprocal: (numerical) The reciprocal of the difference between the ratio of credit amount to loan duration and a numerical label encoding of the applicant's savings status. This engineered feature inverts and scales the relationship between the applicant's monthly credit burden (credit_amount/duration) and their savings level, where a higher value indicates a smaller gap between the monthly burden and the savings category code.
- **name**: purpose (categorical)  
- **description**: Specifies the intended use or objective for which the credit loan is being requested. This categorical feature captures the applicant's stated primary goal, such as acquiring a vehicle, furnishing a home, funding education, or other personal or business needs.  
- **purpose**: Purpose of the credit (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and existing obligations (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- age_residence_since_multiply_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature calculated by first multiplying the applicant's age and their duration of residence (in years), then dividing the result by the numerical label assigned to their savings account status. This feature combines temporal stability indicators (age and residence) weighted by financial liquidity, potentially capturing the interaction between long-term personal stability and savings capacity.
- age_existing_credits_divide_age_subtract_abs: The absolute difference between the applicant's age and the result of dividing their age by their number of existing credit accounts. This engineered feature quantifies the proportional deviation of age relative to its distribution across held credits, where values near zero indicate the number of credits is roughly proportional to age, and larger values suggest a mismatch. (numerical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants or guarantors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This feature reflects the level of external financial backing for the loan. (categorical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male divorced/separated/married, female divorced/separated/married, or male married/widowed (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of property offered by the applicant as collateral for the credit, such as real estate, a car, or other assets (categorical)
- age_existing_credits_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to their number of existing credit accounts at other institutions, calculated by dividing age by existing_credits. This numerical feature may indicate financial experience relative to current credit obligations. (numerical)
- job: Occupation of the applicant, categorized into groups such as unskilled resident, skilled employee, or highly qualified professional/self-employed (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of other existing installment plans with banks or stores, indicating the presence and source of concurrent financial commitments (categorical)

- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). The categories are: no checking account, a balance less than 0 DM (overdrawn), a balance between 0 and 200 DM (low), and a balance of 200 DM or more. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with tiers indicating the approximate monetary level held: '<100' (less than 100 DM), '100<=X<500' (between 100 and 499 DM), '500<=X<1000' (between 500 and 999 DM), '>=1000' (1000 DM or more), and 'no known savings' (unknown or no savings). (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum of debt. (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: (numerical) The ratio of the requested credit amount to the loan duration in months. This feature represents the monthly financial burden or installment size if the loan were repaid in equal monthly payments over the agreed duration, providing a measure of repayment density.
- credit_amount_duration_divide_savings_status_label_encode_subtract_reciprocal: (numerical) The reciprocal of the difference between the ratio of credit amount to loan duration and a numerical label encoding of the applicant's savings status. This engineered feature inverts a relationship that combines repayment burden (credit per month) with savings level, where a larger resulting value indicates the two terms are very close in magnitude.
- **name**: purpose  
  **desc**: The intended use of the requested credit, categorized into specific types such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, business, education, or other defined purposes. (categorical)
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical) - Represents the applicant's past repayment behavior with existing credits. Categories include: 'all paid' (diligent repayment), 'existing paid' (current credits are being repaid duly), 'delayed previously' (past critical account or delays), 'critical/other existing credit' (existing credits at other banks are problematic), and 'no credits/all paid' (no prior credits or all previous credits paid back).
- name: Name of the applicant (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- age_residence_since_multiply_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the applicant's age and their duration of residence at the current address, which is then divided by a numerical encoding of their savings status. This feature combines temporal stability indicators (age and residence duration) with financial capacity (savings), potentially capturing a composite profile of reliability and economic standing.
- age_existing_credits_divide_age_subtract_abs: The absolute difference between a person's age and the result of dividing their age by their number of existing credit accounts. This engineered feature measures the proportional deviation, highlighting whether the number of existing credits is unusually high or low relative to the applicant's age, with smaller values indicating closer alignment. (numerical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of any additional parties who have co-signed or guaranteed the loan, serving as a risk-mitigating factor for the lender (categorical: none, guarantor, co-applicant).
- personal_status: Personal status and gender classification, encompassing categories such as male single, male married/widowed, female divorced/separated/married, and male divorced/separated/married (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or property offered by the applicant as collateral or security for the credit. This is a categorical feature with classes such as 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property', indicating the level and type of financial backing for the loan. (categorical)
- age_existing_credits_divide: The ratio of the applicant's age to their number of existing credit accounts at other banks. This feature is derived by dividing the applicant's age in years by the 'existing_credits' value, potentially indicating the density of credit obligations relative to life stage. (numerical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and occupational type (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans with other banks or stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_amount_duration_multiply_credit_amount_sqrt_divide: (numerical) A derived numerical feature calculated by first multiplying the credit amount by the loan duration, then dividing the result by the square root of the credit amount. This complex feature may represent a scaled measure of the total financial obligation relative to the size of the loan.
- checking_status_label_encode_credit_history_label_encode_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature created by crossing the encoded labels for 'checking_status' and 'credit_history'. It represents the interaction between the applicant's checking account status and their historical credit reliability, with each unique combination (e.g., "1_1", "1_3", "3_3") forming a distinct category.
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Possible categories are: no checking account, a balance less than 0 DM, a balance between 0 and 200 DM, or a balance of 200 DM or more. (categorical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It is a categorical feature with possible values indicating specific monetary ranges or conditions, such as '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'unknown/no savings account'. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the loan amount to the loan duration in months. It represents the average monthly financial burden of the loan principal, where a higher value indicates a larger amount due per month for the given term. (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide_savings_status_label_encode_subtract_reciprocal: (numerical) The reciprocal of the difference between the ratio of credit amount to loan duration and a numerical label encoding of the applicant's savings status. This engineered feature combines repayment burden (credit amount per month), savings stability, and applies an inverse transformation to amplify small differences.
- **name**: purpose  
- **type**: categorical  
- **description**: Specifies the intended use or objective for which the credit loan is being requested, such as business investment, vehicle purchase, household goods, or other personal or commercial needs.  
- **purpose**: Purpose of the credit (categorical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as: no credits taken/all credits paid back duly, existing credits paid back duly till now, delayed payments previously, critical account/other existing credits (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months for the credit loan, representing the agreed repayment period (numerical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's current age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- age_residence_since_multiply_savings_status_label_encode_divide: A derived numerical feature representing the product of the applicant's age and their duration of residence at the current address, which is then divided by the integer label encoding of their savings account status. This feature combines temporal stability (age and residence) with financial behavior (savings), potentially capturing a composite profile of socio-economic reliability. (numerical)
- age_existing_credits_divide_age_subtract_abs: The absolute difference between the applicant's age and the result of dividing their age by their number of existing credits. This engineered feature quantifies the deviation between the applicant's actual age and a scaled version of their age weighted by their current credit obligations, with larger values indicating a greater disparity that may reflect unusual financial responsibility for their life stage. (numerical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This categorical feature assesses the level of third-party financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male mar/wid, female div/dep/mar, and female single (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most valuable asset or property offered by the applicant as collateral or security for the credit. This is a categorical feature with values such as 'real estate', 'building society savings/life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property'. (categorical)
- age_existing_credits_divide: The result of dividing the applicant's age by the number of existing credit accounts they hold. This numerical feature represents the average age burden per existing credit line, where a lower value may indicate a higher density of credit obligations relative to life experience. (numerical)
- job: Occupation or employment type of the applicant, categorized into groups such as unskilled, skilled, or highly qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line, which can serve as a proxy for stability and accessibility (categorical: 'yes', 'no', or 'none')
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable used to assess immigration status and associated employment stability or residency risk (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current address (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of other concurrent installment plans with banks or retail stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
