You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include levels such as 'no checking', '<0', '0<=X<200', and '>=200', which indicate the balance range or absence of an account. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as 'existing paid' (all previous credits paid duly), 'critical/other existing credit' (delayed payments or other problematic credit history), or other classifications indicating prior credit management (categorical)
- **name: purpose**  
- **type: categorical**  
- **description:** Specifies the intended use of the requested credit, categorized into distinct classes such as new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, vacation, retraining, business, or other purposes.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the level of financial assets and liquidity available. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by the length of time with the present employer, expressed as a range in years. The categories are: less than 1 year, 1 to under 4 years, 4 to under 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to existing installment payments, such as loans or leases, expressed as a whole number (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, categorized as male single, male mar/wid (married or widowed), female div/dep/mar (female, divorced/separated/married), or male div/sep (male divorced/separated) (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of any additional parties who are acting as co-applicants, guarantors, or debtors for the credit application. This categorical feature identifies whether the applicant's risk is shared or guaranteed by another entity. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The classification of the applicant's most valuable asset or collateral, which serves as security for the credit (e.g., real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property) (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their current biological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds with banks or retail stores. This indicates existing financial commitments that could affect repayment capacity. (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their primary accommodation type (e.g., rent, own, or other arrangements) (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same financial institution, including the one being applied for if already active (numerical integer)
- job: Current employment position or occupational category of the applicant (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no'. This feature reflects immigration status and may be associated with different employment stability or residency constraints. (categorical)
- credit_amount_age_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the applicant's age. This engineered feature helps normalize the credit burden relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing the relative magnitude of the financial request. (numerical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It captures the joint condition, such as 'no checking_<100', which may reveal a more nuanced financial profile than either feature alone, potentially indicating higher risk when paired with limited liquidity.
- duration_age_divide_sqrt: A derived numerical feature calculated as the loan duration in months divided by the square root of the applicant's age. This ratio helps normalize the loan term relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing risk associated with longer repayment periods for different age groups. (numerical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the account balance and history into levels such as no checking account, a negative balance ("<0"), a low positive balance ("0<=X<200"), or a high positive balance (">=200"). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including timeliness of repayments and any past defaults (categorical)
- **name**: purpose (categorical)  
- **description**: The intended use for the requested loan, categorized into specific types such as 'new car', 'used car', 'business', 'education', 'radio/tv', 'domestic appliances', 'repairs', 'furniture/equipment', or 'other'. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial goal for the credit and can reflect the risk profile associated with different spending categories.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a continuous numerical variable that represents the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the total liquid savings and bond holdings into ordinal tiers: 'no known savings' indicates no verifiable savings, '<100 DM' represents a small positive balance under 100 DM, '100<=X<500 DM' is a low to moderate savings level, '500<=X<1000 DM' is a substantial savings amount, and '>=1000 DM' signifies high savings or bond holdings. This feature reflects financial stability and reserves. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years of service: less than 1 year, between 1 and 4 years, between 4 and 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- **installment_commitment**: The monthly installment amount for the loan, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the relative burden of the repayment obligation on the borrower's available monthly funds. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male married/divorced, female single, and female divorced/separated/married (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature identifies whether the applicant has co-signers, joint applicants, or other parties who share responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most significant property or asset owned by the applicant, which serves as an indicator of their financial stability and collateral value. The categories include: real estate, building society savings agreement/life insurance, car or other vehicle, no known property, or unknown/no property. (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans with banks or stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: The applicant's current housing situation, which indicates whether they rent, own, have a mortgage, or live for free. This is a categorical feature that can reflect financial stability and living costs. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held and actively managed by the applicant at this specific banking institution (numerical)
- job: Current occupation or employment type of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled employee/official, or highly qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical: 'none' indicates no telephone, 'yes' indicates a telephone is registered)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- credit_amount_age_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio of the requested credit amount to the applicant's age. This engineered feature helps normalize the credit burden relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing risk patterns that raw values alone may not reveal. (numerical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It captures the joint financial condition, such as having a negative checking balance while also having no known savings, which may provide a more nuanced risk indicator than either feature alone.
- duration_age_divide_sqrt: (numerical) A derived feature calculated by dividing the loan duration (in months) by the square root of the applicant's age (in years). This ratio helps normalize the loan term relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing the relative burden or risk of a long-term commitment for a younger versus an older borrower.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) and categorized into specific ranges or conditions. Categories typically include: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan agreement from disbursement to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit, including payment timeliness and any defaults or delinquencies (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- desc: The intended use for the requested loan, categorized into specific domains such as business, car (new/used), domestic appliances, education, furniture/equipment, radio/television, repairs, vacation, or other purposes.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, denominated in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the financial buffer and indicates the applicant's ability to cover unexpected expenses or payment shortfalls. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration ranges, indicating the length of time the applicant has been with their present employer. The categories are: '<1' (less than 1 year), '1<=X<4' (between 1 and 3 years), '4<=X<7' (between 4 and 6 years), and '>=7' (7 years or more). This is a categorical feature. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying installments for existing loans, including the proposed new loan. This is a numerical feature representing a financial burden ratio. (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, female div/dep/mar (divorced/separated/married), male mar/wid (married/widowed), or male div/sep (divorced/separated) (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset, which serves as collateral or an indicator of financial stability (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, categorized as 'none' (no other plans), 'bank' (a plan through a bank), or 'stores' (a plan through a department or retail store) (categorical)
- housing: Indicates the applicant's current housing situation, categorized by the type of accommodation they occupy, such as renting, owning, or other arrangements (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific financial institution, including both active and ongoing commitments, which serves as an indicator of the applicant's current debt load and credit utilization with the bank (numerical integer)
- job: Current employment position or occupational category of the applicant, indicating their professional status and stability (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, such as children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide maintenance and support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature used to assess potential residency stability and employment authorization status (categorical)
- credit_amount_age_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the applicant's age. This engineered feature helps normalize the credit burden relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing risk patterns where very high credit relative to age may indicate overextension. (numerical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It captures potential risk patterns that may not be evident when considering each feature in isolation, such as the joint condition of having no checking account while maintaining moderate savings.
- duration_age_divide_sqrt: The square root of the ratio of the loan duration (in months) to the applicant's age (in years). This engineered feature helps normalize the loan term relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing risk associated with long repayment periods for younger borrowers. (numerical)

- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature specifies the intended use of the loan funds. Categories include, but are not limited to, new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation, retraining, and other purposes.
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature identifies whether the applicant has co-signers, co-debtors, or guarantors who would share responsibility for the loan, which influences the lender's risk assessment. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the loan in months (numerical)
- savings_status_employment_cross_credit_amount_divide_log: (categorical) A composite categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's savings status and their employment duration, further segmented by a logarithmic transformation of the requested credit amount. Each category is a concatenated string (e.g., '100<=X<500_1<=X<4') where the first part denotes the savings account balance range and the second part denotes the employment duration in years, with both ranges contextualized by the scaled credit amount.
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- credit_amount_checking_status_label_encode_multiply: A derived numerical feature representing the product of the original credit amount and an encoded numerical label for the applicant's checking account status. This interaction term captures the combined financial effect of the loan size and the perceived risk associated with the applicant's available transactional funds. (numerical)
- credit_amount_age_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio of the requested credit amount to the applicant's age. This engineered feature helps normalize the credit amount relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing risk patterns related to financial burden over a lifespan. (numerical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration ranges, indicating the length of time the applicant has been employed at their present job. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value represents the applicant's current level of active credit engagement with the institution. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_history: A categorical variable describing the applicant's past record of managing credit, including the status of previous loans and payment punctuality. (categorical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: (categorical) A combined categorical feature representing the interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It captures the joint financial condition, such as "no checking_500<=X<1000" or "<0_100<=X<500", which may reveal risk patterns not apparent when the two statuses are considered separately.
- duration_age_divide_sqrt: The ratio of the loan duration in months to the square root of the applicant's age in years. This engineered feature normalizes the loan term relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing risk associated with longer repayment periods for different age groups. (numerical)
- residence_since: Duration of residence at the current address, measured in whole years (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: no checking account, a negative balance ('<0'), a low balance ('0<=X<200'), or a substantial balance ('>=200'). (categorical)
- **purpose**: Specifies the intended use of the requested credit, categorized by the type of goods or services to be financed. (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional parties who have co-signed, guaranteed, or are otherwise obligated for the credit, serving as a risk distribution indicator (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the loan in months (numerical)
- savings_status_employment_cross_credit_amount_divide_log: (categorical) A composite categorical feature formed by first crossing the 'savings_status' and 'employment' categories, and then appending a discretized version (log-based binning) of the 'credit_amount' to each resulting combination. It represents the interaction between a client's savings level, employment stability, and the magnitude of the requested credit.
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line (categorical: 'none' for no telephone, or the specific provider/service if applicable)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- credit_amount_checking_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the loan's credit amount and an encoded numerical label for the applicant's checking account status. This value is calculated by multiplying the raw credit amount (in Deutsche Marks) by a code assigned to the `checking_status` category, creating a composite metric that reflects both financial scale and account standing.
- credit_amount_age_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the ratio between the requested credit amount and the applicant's age. This numerical feature helps normalize the credit amount relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially identifying risk levels where the loan size is disproportionately large or small for the borrower's age. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges in years: <1 for less than one year, 1<=X<4 for one to under four years, 4<=X<7 for four to under seven years, and >=7 for seven or more years. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including the one being applied for; this is a discrete numerical value that indicates the applicant's current level of indebtedness to the institution (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns, defaults, or delinquencies (categorical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: A categorical feature representing the combined interaction between an applicant's checking account status and their savings account status. It is derived by crossing the two original features to capture potential non-linear relationships and interdependencies that may influence credit risk. (categorical)
- duration_age_divide_sqrt: The square root of the ratio of the loan duration in months to the applicant's age in years. This engineered feature normalizes the loan term relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing risk associated with long repayment periods for younger borrowers. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address, indicating stability (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The number of existing installment commitments or loans the applicant is obligated to pay, expressed as a count (integer).
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). The categories are: 'no checking' (indicating no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- **name**: purpose (categorical)  
- **purpose**: Specifies the intended use or objective for which the credit loan is being requested. This categorical feature helps assess the risk and legitimacy of the loan by indicating the underlying need, such as financing a vehicle, education, appliances, or other personal investments.
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature identifies whether the applicant has co-signers, such as a co-applicant or guarantor, which can influence the risk assessment of the loan. (categorical)
- name: The purpose for which the credit is requested, such as new car, furniture/equipment, or other specific categories (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- savings_status_employment_cross_credit_amount_divide_log: (categorical) A binned categorical feature representing the interaction between a client's savings status and employment duration, further combined with a transformed credit amount. The value is derived by first crossing the categories of 'savings_status' and 'employment', and then segmenting based on the result of dividing the original credit amount by the natural logarithm of the amount, which is subsequently discretized into specific bins.
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a telephone registered in their own name (categorical: 'yes', 'no'). The value 'none' is used to represent the absence of a registered telephone.
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential occupancy (e.g., rent, own, or for free) (categorical)
- credit_amount_checking_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the multiplicative interaction between the original credit amount and an encoded numerical label for the applicant's checking account status. It quantifies the combined financial influence of the loan size and the perceived risk associated with the applicant's available checking balance.
- credit_amount_age_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the total credit amount divided by the applicant's age. This engineered feature helps normalize the credit amount relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing risk patterns where the proportion of credit to age is a significant factor. (numerical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges in years, indicating the applicant's current job stability and length of employment. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value represents the applicant's current level of active credit engagement with the institution. (numerical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and existing obligations (categorical)
- checking_status_savings_status_cross: A categorical feature representing the combined interaction of an applicant's checking account status and savings account status. Each value is a composite label formed by concatenating the individual categories from the two source features, separated by an underscore, to capture their joint effect on credit risk. (categorical)
- duration_age_divide_sqrt: The square root of the ratio of the loan duration in months to the applicant's age in years. This derived feature normalizes the loan term relative to the applicant's life stage, potentially capturing the relative burden or risk period of the debt. (numerical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has lived at their current residence (numerical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to installment payments for existing loans, expressed as an integer categorical value (e.g., 1 for low, 4 for high) (ordinal)
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: no checking account, a negative balance ('<0'), a low balance ('0<=X<200'), or a substantial balance ('>=200'). (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include, but are not limited to, specific goals such as a new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, or vacation.
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and role of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature identifies whether the applicant has co-signers, and if so, their relationship or responsibility level to the loan obligation. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- savings_status_employment_cross_credit_amount_divide_log: A categorical feature representing the combined interaction of an applicant's savings status and employment status, further transformed by the logarithmic scaling of the credit amount. Each category is a composite string indicating a specific savings bracket, employment duration bracket, and the corresponding adjusted credit amount tier. (categorical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has registered a telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with possible values of 'yes' (registered), 'no' (not registered), or 'none' (no telephone line available).
- housing: Current housing status of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- credit_amount_checking_status_label_encode_multiply: A numerical interaction feature derived by multiplying the original credit amount with an encoded numerical label representing the applicant's checking account status. This feature captures the combined financial influence of both the loan size and the applicant's available transactional liquidity. (numerical)
- credit_amount_age_divide_log: The natural logarithm of the total credit amount divided by the applicant's age in years. This engineered feature represents the relative burden or scale of the requested credit in relation to the applicant's life stage, with higher values indicating a larger credit request for a younger individual. (numerical)
- employment: Current employment status expressed as the duration of employment in years, categorized into specific ranges including unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to less than 4 years, 4 to less than 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including the one being applied for. This numerical value reflects the applicant's current level of credit engagement and potential debt burden with the institution. (numerical)
