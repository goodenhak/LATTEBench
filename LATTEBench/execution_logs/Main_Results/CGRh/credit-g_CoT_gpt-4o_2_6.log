Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, with categories including 'existing paid' (indicating all prior credits were duly paid), 'critical/other existing credit' (indicating delays or critical issues with existing credits), 'all paid' (all previous credits paid back), 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid), and 'delayed previously' (past instances of delayed payments). This feature assesses the risk level based on the applicant's historical repayment reliability. (categorical)
- **name: purpose**  
  **desc:** Specifies the intended use or objective for which the credit loan is being requested. This categorical feature captures the primary reason given by the applicant, such as financing a vehicle, home improvements, business needs, or consumer goods.  
  **type:** categorical
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, denominated in Deutsche Marks (DM), representing the principal loan sum before interest (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's existing savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of savings: '<100 DM', '100<=X<500 DM', '500<=X<1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'no known savings'. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration in years, with options including less than 1 year, between 1 and 4 years, between 4 and 7 years, and 7 or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The monthly installment amount for the credit, expressed as a percentage of the borrower's disposable income. This represents the fixed, recurring financial obligation relative to available income. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as male single, male married or widowed, female divorced or separated, or female single (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are other debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application, which can affect risk assessment by sharing liability (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or asset, which serves as collateral or an indicator of financial stability (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of the applicant's other concurrent installment plans, specifically those from banks or department stores, which may indicate existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit lines or loans currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, not including the loan being applied for in this instance (numerical integer)
- job: Job category of the applicant, indicating their occupational skill level and employment type (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents or people for whom the applicant is financially responsible and liable to provide maintenance, such as children or other relatives (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name. This is a categorical feature with possible values of 'yes' for having a telephone or 'none' for no telephone listed. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values 'yes' or 'no'. This is a categorical feature that may influence credit risk assessment due to differing employment stability, residency status, or legal working conditions. (categorical)
- duration_age_plus_log: The natural logarithm of the applicant's age, added to the loan duration in months. This engineered feature combines temporal risk factors, where a higher value may indicate a longer-term commitment for an older applicant. (numerical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature representing the result of dividing the original credit amount by a numerical label encoding of the applicant's savings status. This ratio potentially normalizes the requested loan size relative to the individual's savings bracket, serving as an indicator of financial proportion or risk exposure.
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: A categorical feature engineered by first multiplying the values of 'employment' (duration in current job) and 'residence_since' (years at current residence), and then concatenating the resulting numerical product with the value of 'existing_credits' (number of existing credit lines at this bank) to form a composite category. (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized into levels such as 'no checking account', '<0 DM' (negative balance), '0<=X<200 DM' (low positive balance), and '>=200 DM' (high positive balance), indicating liquidity and financial stability. (categorical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayments, including timeliness and any defaults (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)  
- purpose: Specific intended use of the requested loan, categorized into domains such as business, furniture/equipment, domestic appliance, radio/television, or other personal and commercial expenditures.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This is a continuous numerical feature that represents the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the total liquid savings and bond holdings, with common tiers indicating no savings, very low savings, moderate savings, substantial savings, or high-value savings accounts. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration ranges, indicating the length of time the applicant has been with their present employer. Categories include: '<1' (less than 1 year), '1<=X<4' (between 1 and 3 years), '4<=X<7' (between 4 and 6 years), and '>=7' (7 years or more). (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The installment rate as a percentage of the applicant's disposable income, representing the portion of their available income already committed to repaying existing loans (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced/separated, widowed) combined with gender (male or female) as a composite categorical variable (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of external financial support or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of consecutive years the applicant has lived at their current residential address, indicating stability and local community ties (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable asset or property offered as collateral, which influences creditworthiness and risk assessment (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans with banks or stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: Type of housing accommodation the applicant currently resides in, including categories such as renting, owning a home, or living rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: Count of all currently active credit lines or loans held by the applicant at this specific bank, including installment loans, credit cards, and overdrafts. This numerical value represents the applicant's current direct credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- job: Current employment occupation category, classified as unskilled resident, unskilled non-resident, skilled employee, or highly skilled/management (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'; this is a categorical feature that may influence credit risk assessment based on residency and employment stability. (categorical)
- duration_age_plus_log: A derived numerical feature calculated as the natural logarithm of the sum of the loan duration in months and the applicant's age in years. This transformation compresses the scale of the combined term and may help model non-linear relationships. (numerical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature representing the result of dividing the original credit amount by a numerical label encoding of the applicant's savings status. This engineered feature captures the interaction between the scale of the requested loan and the categorized level of the applicant's existing savings, potentially indicating their relative financial commitment or risk.
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: (categorical) A derived feature combining three original attributes: employment duration, length of residence at current address, and number of existing credits. It represents a concatenated categorical descriptor formed by multiplying the numerical representation of the employment duration category with the residence duration and then appending the existing credits count as a string. This feature aims to capture the combined stability and existing debt burden of an applicant.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM) and categorized into specific monetary ranges or conditions such as 'no checking', '<0', '0<=X<200', and '>=200'. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This is a continuous numerical variable representing the principal loan amount. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior regarding credit repayment, including timeliness and fulfillment of previous credit obligations (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated to repay the credit if the primary applicant defaults. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial backing for the loan. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, female divorced/separated/married, male married/widowed, and female single (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific types such as new car, used car, radio/television, furniture/equipment, business, education, repairs, domestic appliances, or other purposes. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial goal for the credit and can reflect the risk profile associated with different types of expenditures.
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the credit or loan agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: A categorical feature representing combined and binned information derived from the applicant's employment duration, residence stability, and existing credit count. It is created by multiplying relevant numerical values and then concatenating or mapping the result into discrete, ordered categories such as '1<=X<44', '4<=X<72', '>=73', and '>=74'. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment with the current employer. The categories represent ranges of years or specific employment states, such as unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable property or collateral, which serves as a key indicator of financial stability and security for the credit. This categorical feature includes classifications such as real estate, life insurance, car, or no known property. (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) The result of dividing the original loan amount (credit_amount) by a numerically encoded representation of the applicant's savings status. This engineered feature combines financial scale with savings behavior into a single continuous variable.
- age: Age in years of the applicant at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds with banks or stores, which may indicate existing financial commitments and credit burden (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- job: Occupation of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled, or high qualif/self-employed/management (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_log: (numerical) A derived feature representing the natural logarithm of the product between the original credit amount (in Deutsche Marks) and an encoded numerical representation of the applicant's savings status. This transformation combines financial scale with savings behavior into a single continuous value, where more negative results typically indicate a very low product before the log was applied.
- duration_age_plus_log_exp: A derived numerical feature calculated by summing the loan duration in months, the applicant's age in years, and the natural logarithm of the applicant's work experience in years. It represents a composite risk indicator that increases with longer loan terms, higher applicant age, and greater career tenure. (numerical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, denoted in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories represent specific monetary ranges: 'no checking account', '<0 DM' (negative balance), '0<=X<200 DM' (low positive balance), and '>=200 DM' (substantial balance). This feature is a key indicator of the applicant's short-term financial liquidity and stability. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The amount of credit requested by the applicant in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature that describes the applicant's past credit behavior and existing credit relationships. It includes categories such as 'existing paid' (for credits paid duly at this bank), 'critical/other existing credit' (for delayed payments or other critical accounts at this bank), 'all paid' (for all previous credits paid duly elsewhere), and 'no credits/all paid' (for no previous credits or all prior credits paid duly). (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated for the credit. This categorical feature assesses the shared responsibility for loan repayment. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male married or widowed, female divorced/separated/married, or female single (categorical)
- **name**: purpose (categorical)  
- **description**: The intended use or goal for which the credit loan is being requested. This feature categorizes the primary objective of the loan, such as acquiring household goods, funding education, starting a business, or purchasing a vehicle.  
- **purpose**: Purpose of the credit (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: (categorical) A composite categorical feature derived from the concatenation or interaction of three underlying factors: the applicant's current employment seniority, the duration of residence at their current address, and their number of existing credit accounts. The values represent binned and combined categories, such as '<12', '1<=X<42', '4<=X<74', and '>=74', which describe integrated stability and credit history profiles rather than raw numerical values.
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years of service at the present job. (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's primary property or asset used as collateral, such as real estate, a car, life insurance, or no significant property (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived numerical feature representing the result of dividing the original credit amount by an encoded numerical representation of the applicant's savings status. This value combines information about the loan size with the borrower's financial buffer, where a higher result may indicate a larger loan relative to savings security, or a lower result may indicate more substantial savings relative to the credit requested.
- age: Age of the individual applicant in whole years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, such as those with banks or department stores, which may impact the applicant's existing debt burden and repayment capacity (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, categorized as either 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled employee, or highly qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_log: (numerical) A derived numerical feature resulting from the multiplication of the encoded savings status label and the natural logarithm of the original credit amount. It represents a non-linear interaction between the applicant's savings profile and the scale of the credit requested.
- duration_age_plus_log_exp: A derived numerical feature calculated by summing the loan duration in months, the applicant's age in years, and the natural logarithm of the applicant's years at their current residence (where residence_since is a component of the original concatenated feature). It represents a composite risk indicator combining the loan term, applicant maturity, and residential stability. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account in Deutsche Mark (DM), categorized as 'no checking', '0<=X<200' (indicating a low positive balance), '200<=X' (indicating a substantial positive balance), or '<0' (indicating an overdrawn/negative balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount: The amount of credit requested or granted in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical) with categories: 'existing paid' (no delays), 'critical/other existing credit' (delays or problematic), 'all paid' (all previous credits paid back), 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid), and 'delayed previously' (past delays but now paid).
- other_parties: Specifies whether additional parties are involved as co-applicants, guarantors, or debtors for the credit application (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as male single, male married/widowed, female single, or female div/dep/mar (divorced/separated/married) (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific domains such as a new car, used car, furniture/equipment, radio/television, domestic appliances, repairs, education, vacation, retraining, business, or other. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial goal and can correlate with the loan's risk level based on the asset's depreciating nature, necessity, or potential for income generation.
- name: The unique identifier for each loan application (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the loan in months (numerical)
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: (categorical) A composite categorical feature derived from the concatenation of binned numerical values. It represents the combined effect of the applicant's employment duration at their current residence and their number of existing credits, after each has been multiplied and then categorized into specific ranges (e.g., '<13', '1<=X<44', '4<=X<74'). This feature captures the stability and existing debt burden of the applicant as a single, discrete segment.
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment with the current employer. The categories include unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- property_magnitude: Category of the applicant's most valuable owned property or asset, used to assess financial stability and collateral (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature representing the result of dividing the original loan amount (credit_amount) by a numerical encoding of the applicant's savings status. This engineered value combines financial scale with fiscal stability, where a higher result typically indicates a larger loan relative to the encoded savings category.
- age: Age of the individual applicant in whole years (numerical, integer)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, such as those with banks or department stores (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- job: Occupational category of the applicant, such as unskilled resident, skilled employee, or highly qualified professional/self-employed (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_log: (numerical) A derived numerical feature representing the natural logarithm of the product between the original credit amount (in Deutsche Marks) and a label-encoded numerical representation of the applicant's savings status. This transformation combines the scale of the loan with the borrower's savings behavior, compressing the range of values and potentially revealing multiplicative interactions that are more suitable for linear modeling.
- duration_age_plus_log_exp: A derived numerical feature calculated as the sum of the loan duration in months, the applicant's age in years, and the natural logarithm of the applicant's employment duration in years. It represents a composite risk indicator combining time-based commitments and stability. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized into specific ranges of the balance in Deutsche Mark (DM). The categories include: "<0" (negative balance), "0<=X<200" (low positive balance), ">=200" (high positive balance), and "no checking account". (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This is a continuous numerical feature that represents the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior in repaying debts and meeting credit obligations, categorized as 'existing paid' for loans repaid on time, 'critical/other existing credit' for past difficulties or other active credits, or 'no credits/all paid' for no prior credit or fully settled accounts (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants or guarantors (categorical: 'none', 'co applicant', 'guarantor')
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, categorized as male single, male married/widowed, female single, or female married/widowed/divorced (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: The specific intended use for the requested loan, categorized into types such as 'new car', 'used car', 'business', 'furniture/equipment', and others, which indicates the borrower's primary financial objective and risk profile associated with that asset class.
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement from initiation to the final payment due date (numerical)
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: (categorical) A composite categorical feature derived from the concatenation of two processed variables: the duration of employment at the current residence and the number of existing credits. The values represent binned or categorized combined states, such as '<14' or '1<=X<41', which indicate specific joint conditions of employment stability and existing credit burden.
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by duration ranges and employment type, including specific classifications such as 'unemployed', '1<=X<4' years, '>=7' years, and others as indicated in the data samples. (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The scale or category of the applicant's existing assets or collateral, such as real estate, a car, or no known property (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature representing the result of dividing the original credit amount by a numerical representation of the applicant's savings status, where the savings status has first been converted into a numeric value through label encoding. This engineered feature captures the interaction between the loan size and the client's savings category.
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds with banks or stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no', which categorizes their work permit or citizenship status relevant to the country of the credit institution (categorical)
- job: Occupation or employment type of the individual, categorized into groups such as unskilled resident, skilled, or high qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_log: (numerical) A derived numerical feature resulting from the multiplication of the original credit amount (in Deutsche Marks) with an encoded representation of the applicant's savings status, subsequently transformed by the natural logarithm. This engineered feature aims to capture the non-linear interaction between the loan size and the applicant's financial buffer, compressing the scale to mitigate the influence of extreme values.
- duration_age_plus_log_exp: A derived numerical feature calculated by summing the loan duration in months, the applicant's age in years, and the natural logarithm of the applicant's years of employment experience, resulting in a composite risk and capacity score. (numerical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized as either having a negative balance ('<0'), a low positive balance ('0<=X<200'), no checking account ('no checking'), or a substantial positive balance ('>=200'). This feature indicates the applicant's short-term financial liquidity and stability. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). This is a fundamental numerical feature representing the principal sum of debt to be incurred. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as 'existing paid' (indicating timely repayment of previous credits), 'critical/other existing credit' (suggesting delays, defaults, or other problematic credit accounts), or other potential statuses like 'all paid' or 'no credits taken'. This is a critical indicator of repayment reliability. (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and type of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature indicates whether the applicant has co-signers or other parties who share responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, including categories such as male single, male mar/wid (married or widowed), female div/dep/mar (divorced, separated, or married), etc. (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- desc: The intended use for the requested loan funds, categorized into specific domains such as a used car, furniture/equipment, repairs, or other common financial needs. This feature indicates the applicant's stated goal for the credit and can reflect the associated risk level of the loan's underlying asset or expense type.
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the agreed-upon loan repayment period (numerical)
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: (categorical) A composite categorical feature derived from the concatenation or interaction of three original variables: the applicant's employment duration in years, their residence stability in years, and their current number of existing credits. The resulting categories represent specific combined ranges or thresholds, such as '<12', '4<=X<72', and '>=72', which describe the applicant's overall stability and existing debt burden profile.
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years spent with the present employer. The categories are: '<1' (less than one year), '1<=X<4' (between one and less than four years), '4<=X<7' (between four and less than seven years), and '>=7' (seven years or more). (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable asset or property, used as collateral for the loan. This is a categorical feature with common values including 'real estate', 'life insurance', 'car', or 'no known property'. (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) A derived feature representing the result of dividing the original credit amount by an encoded numerical representation of the applicant's savings status. This engineered feature quantifies the relationship between the loan size and the borrower's financial buffer, where a higher value may indicate a larger requested credit relative to their savings level.
- age: Age in years of the applicant at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Existing installment plans with other institutions, categorized as 'bank' (for bank installment plans), 'stores' (for retail or store installment plans), or 'none' (indicating no other active installment plans) (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'; this is a categorical feature that may reflect institutional trust or perceived employment stability (categorical)
- job: Job classification of the applicant, indicating their skill level and employment type (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_log: (numerical) A derived numerical feature resulting from the multiplication of the original credit amount with an encoded representation of the applicant's savings status, subsequently transformed by the natural logarithm. This feature combines financial scale, savings behavior, and a non-linear transformation to potentially capture complex interactions for the model.
- duration_age_plus_log_exp: A derived numerical feature calculated by summing the loan duration in months, the applicant's age in years, and the natural logarithm of the applicant's employment duration in years (or a transformed employment value). It represents a composite risk indicator combining time-based factors. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). The categories indicate the level of financial liquidity and stability, which is a critical risk factor for credit assessment. (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- other_parties: Specifies whether there are any additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This indicates the level of external financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced/separated) combined with gender (male, female) as a composite categorical variable (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: The intended use for the requested credit, categorized into specific domains such as a car, furniture/equipment, education, business, or other personal expenses. This indicates the applicant's financial goal and risk profile associated with that type of expenditure.
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: (categorical) A composite feature derived from the concatenation of two processed variables: employment duration at current residence and the total number of existing credits, which have been multiplied and then categorized into specific, discrete bins. These bins represent combined thresholds of stability and existing debt burden, such as '<12', '1<=X<42', '<16', and '>=73'.
- checking_status: Status of the existing checking account, categorized into ranges such as 'no checking', '<0', or '0<=X<200'. (categorical)
- credit_amount: Amount of credit requested or loaned, in the local currency. (numerical)
- credit_history: Applicant's past credit behavior, with categories like 'no credits/all paid', 'existing paid', or 'critical/other existing credit'. (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates whether a co-applicant or guarantor is involved, with values such as 'none' or 'co applicant'. (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, for example 'male single'. (categorical)
- purpose: Intended use of the credit, such as 'business' or 'radio/tv'. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit or loan, in months. (numerical)
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: A derived feature combining employment duration, residence stability, and existing credits into a categorical range (e.g., '1<=X<412', '>=74'). (categorical)
- employment: Present employment duration, categorized into ranges such as '1<=X<4' or '>=7' years. (categorical)
- property_magnitude: Scale or type of the applicant's property, for instance 'real estate' or 'no known property'. (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: A transformed feature resulting from dividing the credit amount by an encoded representation of savings status. (numerical)
- age: Age of the applicant, in years. (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Existence of other payment plans, with categories like 'none'. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates if the applicant is a foreign worker, with values 'yes' or 'no'. (categorical)
- job: Employment classification, such as 'unskilled resident' or 'skilled'. (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_log: A transformed feature resulting from the logarithm of the product of credit amount and an encoded savings status. (numerical)
- duration_age_plus_log_exp: A derived feature combining credit duration, applicant age, and a logarithmic component. (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of valuable assets or property owned by the applicant, used as collateral or an indicator of financial stability. Examples include 'real estate', 'car', or 'no known property'. (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) The result of dividing the original loan credit amount by a numerical label encoding of the applicant's savings status. This engineered feature represents the loan amount per unit of savings status, potentially normalizing the credit request against the applicant's perceived financial stability as indicated by their savings.
- age: Age of the individual applicant in whole years (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: The existence of other concurrent installment plans with either banks or retail stores, which may influence the applicant's existing debt burden and repayment capacity (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical variable with binary classification used to assess immigration status as a potential risk factor in credit evaluation (categorical)
- job: Occupation or employment type of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled employee, or highly qualified/self-employed/management (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_log: (numerical) A derived numerical feature representing the natural logarithm of the product between the original credit amount and an encoded numerical representation of the applicant's savings status. This transformation combines the scale of the loan request with the borrower's financial buffer, compressing the range into a logarithmic scale to mitigate the influence of extreme values and model potential multiplicative interactions.
- duration_age_plus_log_exp: A derived numerical feature calculated by summing the loan duration in months, the applicant's age in years, and the natural logarithm of the applicant's employment duration in years (or a transformed employment value). It represents a composite risk indicator combining time-based factors of the credit application. (numerical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in categorical ranges of Deutsche Mark (DM) balances or descriptive conditions. Categories include: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. It is a continuous numerical feature that represents the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and any previous delinquencies (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, categorized as 'none', 'guarantor', or 'co-applicant' (categorical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, categorized as male single, female div/dep/mar (divorced/separated, dependent, or married), male mar/wid (married or widowed), or female single (categorical)
- name: purpose (categorical)
- purpose: The intended use of the requested loan, categorized into specific types such as 'new car', 'used car', 'furniture/equipment', 'radio/tv', 'domestic appliances', 'repairs', 'education', 'vacation', 'retraining', 'business', or 'other'. This feature indicates the applicant's primary financial goal for the credit and is used to assess risk based on the typical repayment behavior and collateral value associated with different loan purposes.
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit period for which the applicant is applying (numerical)
- employment_residence_since_existing_credits_multiply_concat: (categorical) A composite categorical feature derived from multiplying the duration of employment at the current residence (in years) by the number of existing credits, and then concatenating the result with a predefined categorical bin label. The values represent binned ranges (e.g., "1<=X<42", "<14") that categorize the combined stability and credit exposure of the applicant.
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment with the current employer. The categories are: unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 years or more. (categorical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the most significant property or asset owned by the applicant, used as collateral or an indicator of financial stability (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_divide: (numerical) The result of dividing the original credit amount by a numerically encoded representation of the applicant's savings status. This engineered feature combines financial scale with fiscal behavior, where a higher value typically indicates either a larger loan request relative to the encoded savings category or a savings status associated with a lower numeric label.
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans, including those from banks or retail stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- job: Employment occupation classification of the applicant, categorized as unskilled resident, skilled, or other similar designations (categorical)
- credit_amount_savings_status_label_encode_multiply_log: (numerical) A derived feature representing the natural logarithm of the product between the original loan credit amount and an encoded numerical value for the applicant's savings status. This engineered variable combines financial scale with fiscal stability to capture non-linear interactions that may influence credit risk.
- duration_age_plus_log_exp: A derived numerical feature calculated by summing the loan duration in months, the applicant's age in years, and the natural logarithm of the applicant's employment duration in years, resulting in a composite value representing a weighted total exposure time. (numerical)
