- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the product of the encoded 'checking_status' category and the original 'duration' in months. The 'checking_status' is first converted to a numerical label (e.g., '<0' may be encoded as 1, '0<=X<200' as 0, etc.), and this value is then multiplied by the loan duration. This feature potentially captures the interaction between the applicant's account balance status and the loan term, which may influence risk assessment.
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the loan duration, calculated by dividing the credit_amount by the duration. This feature represents the average monthly financial burden of the loan repayment, assuming a linear paydown, with higher values indicating a larger required payment per month. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_subtract: The difference in years between the applicant's current age and the duration of their residence at the current address. It is calculated as `age` minus `residence_since`.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the account balance into levels such as 'no checking', negative balance ('<0'), or positive balance ranges (e.g., '0<=X<200'). (categorical)
- name: The applicant's full name (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment patterns and any defaults (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the requested loan. Categories include specific goals such as 'new car', 'used car', 'furniture/equipment', 'radio/tv', 'domestic appliances', 'repairs', 'education', 'vacation', 'retraining', 'business', and 'other'. The purpose can indicate the risk profile of the loan, as some uses (like business or other unspecified purposes) may be associated with less predictable repayment behavior compared to secured, tangible assets like a car.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, <100 DM, 100 <= ... < 500 DM, 500 <= ... < 1000 DM, and >=1000 DM. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges representing years of service: '<1' for less than one year, '1<=X<4' for one to under four years, '4<=X<7' for four to under seven years, and '>=7' for seven or more years. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying existing installment debts, such as loans or hire purchases (numerical)
- personal_status: Marital status and gender of the applicant, encompassing categories such as male single, male married or widowed, female, and male divorced or separated (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of third-party support for the credit application, such as a co-applicant or guarantor (categorical: 'none', 'co applicant', 'guarantor')
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable owned property or asset, which serves as potential collateral (categorical)
- age: Age of the applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds with banks or retail stores, which may indicate existing financial commitments and credit burden (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, including loans and credit lines (numerical integer)
- job: Occupation classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and residency status (e.g., unskilled resident, skilled, management). (categorical)
- num_dependents: Number of dependents, such as children or other relatives, for whom the applicant is legally or financially responsible to provide support and maintenance (numerical)
- own_telephone: Whether the applicant has a registered telephone line (categorical: 'yes' indicates a registered line is in the applicant's name, 'none' indicates no telephone line is available)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker (yes) or a domestic worker (no) (categorical)
- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: The product of the encoded value for the applicant's checking account status and the duration of the loan in months. This engineered feature combines the financial stability indicator from the checking account with the loan's time commitment, potentially capturing an interaction effect where risk is influenced by both the applicant's immediate liquidity and the length of the financial obligation. (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the loan duration, calculated by dividing the credit_amount by the duration. This feature represents the average monthly financial burden of the loan repayment, with higher values indicating larger required payments per month. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_subtract: (numerical) The result of subtracting the `residence_since` value from the `age` value. This engineered feature represents the applicant's approximate age at the time they began residing at their current address, potentially indicating life stage stability or the length of their residential history prior to the current address.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by the balance range in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). This indicates liquidity and historical account management. (categorical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months, representing the length of the loan agreement from disbursement to the final payment due date (numerical)
- credit_history: A categorical feature representing the applicant's past credit behavior, categorized as 'no credits/all paid', 'all existing credits paid duly', 'existing paid', 'delayed previously', or 'critical/other existing credit'. This indicates their reliability in repaying previous debts. (categorical)
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical). This feature describes the intended use of the loan funds. Categories include specific goals such as 'new car', 'used car', 'domestic appliance', as well as broader purposes like 'business', 'education', or 'furniture/equipment'. It is a key indicator of risk, as certain loan purposes historically correlate with different probabilities of default.
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM). (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate specific monetary ranges or the absence of known savings. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration in years, with classifications including unemployed (<1 year), short-term employment (1 to 4 years), medium-term employment (4 to 7 years), long-term employment (7+ years), and retired/unemployed. (categorical)
- installment_commitment: The percentage of the applicant's disposable income that is committed to paying existing loan installments, expressed as a numerical value. This represents the ongoing financial obligation from other credit arrangements. (numerical)
- personal_status: Personal status and sex of the applicant, indicating categories such as male single, male divorced/separated, male married/widowed, or female divorced/separated/married (categorical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties obligated for the credit, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors. Categories include 'none' for no other parties, 'guarantor' for a third-party guarantor, and 'co applicant' for a joint applicant. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence (numerical). A longer duration may indicate greater stability.
- property_magnitude: The category of the applicant's most valuable owned property or collateral, which serves as a key indicator of financial stability and security for the loan. This feature includes the following categorical values: 'real estate' (e.g., land or buildings), 'life insurance' (a savings or endowment policy), 'car' (an automobile), or 'no known property' (indicating no significant owned assets). (categorical)
- age: Age in years of the applicant, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- other_payment_plans: Status of any other concurrent installment plans the applicant holds with banks or retail stores, indicating existing financial commitments (categorical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts currently held by the applicant at this same bank, including loans and credit lines, which serves as an indicator of the applicant's current debt burden and ongoing financial commitments with this institution (numerical)
- job: Employment classification of the applicant, categorized by skill level and employment type (categorical)
- num_dependents: Count of individuals, typically children or other legal dependents, for whom the applicant is financially responsible and obligated to provide support (numerical)
- own_telephone: Indicates whether the applicant has a registered telephone line in their name (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no', which is a categorical feature relevant for assessing residency status and potential employment stability. (categorical)
- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: The product of the numerical label assigned to the 'checking_status' category and the duration of the credit in months. This engineered feature combines the client's account status with the loan term to potentially capture risk interactions between these two factors. (numerical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the intended loan duration, calculated by dividing the credit amount by the duration in months. This numerical feature indicates the monthly financial burden or average monthly loan principal if no interest is considered, with higher values suggesting larger periodic commitments. (numerical)
- age_residence_since_subtract: The difference, in years, between the applicant's current age and the duration of their residence at their current address. This numerical feature indicates mobility and potential stability, calculated as `age` minus `residence_since`. A higher value may suggest the applicant lived elsewhere for a longer period before their current residence. (numerical)

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, categorized by its balance in Deutsche Mark (DM). The categories are: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), and '>=200' (high positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the intended loan duration, calculated as credit_amount divided by duration. This numerical feature represents the average monthly loan burden or installment size if the loan were repaid linearly over its term, providing a measure of payment density relative to the loan's timeframe. (numerical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit period (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past behavior with credit obligations, including timeliness of payments and any previous delinquencies or defaults (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's current age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It categorizes the total liquid savings and bond holdings into ordinal tiers: '<100 DM', '100 <= X < 500 DM', '500 <= X < 1000 DM', '>=1000 DM', or 'unknown/no savings account'. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no', used to assess employment stability and residency status (categorical)
- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: The product of a numerical label encoding of the applicant's checking account status and the duration of the requested credit in months. This engineered feature combines the financial stability indicated by the checking account with the loan's time commitment, potentially capturing interaction effects between these two risk factors. (numerical)
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional parties, beyond the primary applicant, who are associated with the credit obligation, acting as either a co-applicant, guarantor, or indicating no other parties are involved (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges: unemployed, less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 4 to 7 years, or 7 years or more. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical). A shorter duration may indicate higher residential instability, while a longer duration can suggest stability and stronger local ties.
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific financial institution. This includes all active credit arrangements, such as personal loans, car loans, overdrafts, and credit cards, and is a direct indicator of the applicant's current debt burden and ongoing credit relationships with the bank. (numerical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their living arrangement and potential financial stability (categorical: "rent", "own", "for free")
- credit_history_age_label_encode_multiply: (categorical) A repeated concatenation of the `credit_history` string value. The string is duplicated multiple times (e.g., "no credits/all paid" repeated 17 times), forming a single composite categorical value that likely results from a specific feature engineering multiplication or encoding operation.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: negative ('<0'), low positive balance ('0<=X<200'), significant positive balance ('>=200'), or no checking account ('no checking'). (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested credit amount to the loan duration, calculated by dividing the credit amount by the duration. This numerical feature represents the average periodic financial burden or installment size if the loan were repaid in equal payments over its full term. (numerical)
- duration: Duration of the credit in months (numerical)
- credit_history: Records of the applicant's past conduct with credit, including payment compliance and any outstanding debts or delinquencies (categorical)
- age: Age in years, representing the applicant's chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). It indicates the level of financial reserves and is a categorical feature with common tiers such as no savings, less than 100 DM, between 100 and 500 DM, between 500 and 1000 DM, and greater than or equal to 1000 DM. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the product of a numerical label encoding of the applicant's checking account status and the duration of the requested credit in months. This feature combines the financial stability indicated by the checking account with the loan's term, potentially capturing risk interactions where account status has a different impact over short versus long loan periods.
- other_parties: Indicates whether there are additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, associated with the credit application. This categorical feature reflects the level of third-party financial support or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into discrete ranges representing years spent with the present employer. (categorical)
- residence_since: Duration (in years) the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical)
- existing_credits: The count of all currently active loans or credit lines the applicant holds at this specific bank, including installment loans, revolving credit, and overdrafts (numerical)
- housing: Type of housing accommodation, indicating whether the individual rents, owns their home, or has other living arrangements (categorical)
- credit_history_age_label_encode_multiply: (categorical) A categorical feature created by repeating the string value of the 'credit_history' field a number of times equal to the 'age' of the applicant. This results in a long, concatenated string that encodes both the applicant's credit history and their age through repetition.

- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: The product of a numerical label encoding for the applicant's checking account status and the duration of the requested credit in months. This engineered feature combines the financial stability indicated by the checking account with the loan's term, potentially amplifying the risk signal for accounts in poor standing over longer durations. (numerical)
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional parties, such as co-applicants, guarantors, or other debtors, who are obligated for the credit. This feature reflects the level of third-party financial backing or shared responsibility for the loan. (categorical)
- employment: Duration of current employment, categorized into ranges representing years of service with the current employer. (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical). A lower value indicates higher residential mobility, while a higher value suggests greater stability.
- existing_credits: The total count of credit accounts (e.g., loans, credit lines) currently held by the applicant at this specific bank. This is a discrete numerical value representing the applicant's current level of indebtedness to this institution. (numerical)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating whether they rent, own their home, or live rent-free (categorical)
- credit_history_age_label_encode_multiply: A categorical feature representing the result of a multiplication operation between a label-encoded version of the applicant's credit history and their age. The value is presented as the string of the original credit history category repeated multiple times, with the number of repetitions likely corresponding to the product of the encoded numerical label and the age. (categorical)

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the account balance range: 'no checking' (no account), '<0' (negative balance), '0<=X<200' (low positive balance), or '>=200' (substantial positive balance). (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested credit amount to the loan duration, calculated by dividing the credit_amount by the duration. This feature represents the average periodic financial commitment (e.g., monthly or yearly) implied by the loan, with higher values indicating larger required payments per time unit. (numerical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit period (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including payment history and existing credit obligations (categorical)
- age: Age of the individual applicant in whole years, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the loan or credit requested by the applicant, measured in the local currency unit (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings accounts and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories indicate the approximate balance range: 'no known savings' (no accounts or unknown), '<100 DM' (low balance), '100<=X<500 DM' (moderate balance), '500<=X<1000 DM' (substantial balance), and '>=1000 DM' (high balance). This feature reflects the applicant's accumulated liquid reserves and financial stability. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values of 'yes' or 'no' (categorical)
- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature calculated by multiplying the numerical label encoding of the applicant's checking account status with the duration of the requested credit in months. This interaction term may help capture the combined effect of an applicant's financial liquidity (as indicated by their checking account) and the length of the credit commitment.
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of additional obligors or guarantors for the credit, such as co-applicants or individuals providing a guarantee. Possible values include 'none' for no other parties, 'guarantor' for a third-party guarantor, or 'co-applicant' for a joint applicant. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration in years, with possible values being 'unemployed', '<1', '1<=X<4', '4<=X<7', and '>=7'. (categorical)
- residence_since: Number of years the applicant has been living at their current residence address (numerical). A lower value indicates a more recent move, while a higher value suggests greater residential stability.
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this bank, including any installment plans (such as car loans or appliance financing), revolving credit accounts, and other outstanding debt obligations. This numerical value represents the applicant's current credit burden with the institution. (numerical)
- housing: Type of housing accommodation, categorized as rent (tenant), own (homeowner), or for free (living without rent payment) (categorical)
- **credit_history_age_label_encode_multiply**: (categorical) A derived categorical feature representing the element-wise string multiplication (repetition) of the encoded 'credit_history' label with the 'age' value. It combines creditworthiness history with the applicant's age, creating a composite categorical value where the history label is repeated a number of times equal to the age.
- credit_amount_duration_divide_residence_since_sqrt_plus: (numerical) A derived feature calculated by first dividing the credit amount by the loan duration, then adding the square root of the duration of residence at the current address. This metric combines the monthly repayment burden (credit_amount/duration) with a stabilizing factor tied to residential stability (sqrt(residence_since)), potentially indicating a borrower's adjusted financial pressure relative to their settled lifestyle.
- checking_status_employment_label_encode_plus_reciprocal: (numerical) A derived numerical feature created by first applying label encoding to the categorical 'checking_status' and 'employment' features, summing these encoded values, and then taking the reciprocal (or inverse) of that sum. This transformation combines information about the applicant's checking account status and employment seniority into a single continuous value, where a smaller result indicates a higher original sum of the two encoded categories.
- duration_age_plus_checking_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived numerical feature calculated by first adding the applicant's age to the original loan duration, then multiplying that sum by an encoded integer label representing their checking account status.

2025-12-22 01:56:16,977 - INFO - Initial prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no checking account, a negative balance ("<0"), a low balance ("0<=X<200"), or a high balance (">=200"). (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the total loan amount (credit_amount) to the loan duration in months (duration). This feature represents the average monthly financial burden or installment size of the loan, assuming a linear repayment schedule. A higher value indicates a larger required monthly outlay relative to the loan term. (numerical)
- duration: Duration in months of the credit or loan agreement, representing the contractual period over which the borrowed amount is to be repaid (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of the applicant's past credit behavior, including repayment patterns and any outstanding credit issues (categorical)
- age: Age of the individual in whole years, representing their current chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. This is a key numerical indicator of the financial scale of the request. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of savings account or bonds, indicating the approximate balance in Deutsche Mark (DM). Categories include: no known savings, <100 DM, 100 <= balance < 500 DM, 500 <= balance < 1000 DM, and >=1000 DM. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, with possible values being 'yes' or 'no'. This is a categorical feature that may influence credit risk assessment due to differing employment stability or residency status. (categorical)
- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: (numerical) A derived feature representing the product of the encoded numerical label for the applicant's checking account status and the duration of the credit in months. It combines the financial stability indicated by the checking account with the loan's term, potentially amplifying risk signals associated with unstable accounts over longer loan periods.
- other_parties: Specifies the presence and role of any additional parties who have co-signed or guaranteed the loan, serving as secondary obligors to the debt. This includes individuals who are legally responsible for repayment if the primary borrower defaults. (categorical)
- employment: Present employment status, categorized by the duration of employment with the current employer. The categories represent ranges of years: less than 1 year (<1), 1 to 4 years (1<=X<4), 4 to 7 years (4<=X<7), and 7 years or more (>=7). This is a categorical feature.
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical). A higher value may indicate greater residential stability.
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this specific bank, representing their immediate, active debt obligations with the institution (numerical integer)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential accommodation (e.g., renting, owning, or living for free) (categorical)
- credit_history_age_label_encode_multiply: A categorical feature representing the element-wise multiplication (or concatenation-based repetition) of the encoded credit history category with the encoded age category, resulting in a compounded categorical value that combines risk history and life stage factors. (categorical)
- **credit_amount_duration_divide_residence_since_sqrt_plus**: (numerical) A derived feature calculated by first dividing the credit amount by the loan duration, then adding the square root of the number of years the applicant has resided at their current address. This feature combines the loan's monthly repayment burden (credit_amount/duration) with a stabilizing factor related to residential stability (sqrt(residence_since)), potentially capturing an applicant's financial pressure relative to their settledness.
- checking_status_employment_label_encode_plus_reciprocal: (numerical) A derived feature calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the label-encoded values for `checking_status` and `employment`. This transformation combines the individual categorical encodings of a client's checking account status and employment seniority into a single numerical value, where a higher result indicates a lower combined encoded score (due to the reciprocal), potentially reflecting a perceived lower risk profile.
- duration_age_plus_checking_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived numerical feature calculated by first adding the applicant's age to the loan duration, then multiplying that sum by the encoded numerical label of their checking account status. This feature combines temporal financial stability (age, duration) with immediate account standing.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?

Features:
- checking_status: Status of the applicant's existing checking account, expressed in Deutsche Mark (DM), with categories indicating specific monetary thresholds or conditions such as a negative balance, a balance within a defined low range, or a balance exceeding a high threshold. (categorical)
- credit_amount_duration_divide: The ratio of the requested credit amount to the intended loan duration, calculated by dividing the credit amount (in Deutsche Marks) by the duration (in months). This numerical feature represents the monthly financial burden or credit density of the loan request. (numerical)
- duration: Duration in months, representing the length of the loan or credit agreement (numerical)
- credit_history: Record of applicant's past credit conduct, categorized as: 'existing paid' (current credits properly serviced), 'critical/other existing credit' (delays or issues with existing credits), 'all paid' (all previous credits duly repaid), 'no credits/all paid' (no previous credits or all paid), or 'delayed previously' (past delays in repayments). (categorical)
- age: Age of the individual applicant in whole years, representing their chronological age at the time of the credit application (numerical)
- credit_amount: The total monetary value of the credit or loan requested by the applicant, measured in Deutsche Marks (DM) for this dataset. It represents the principal sum before interest. (numerical)
- savings_status: Status of the applicant's savings account and bonds, measured in Deutsche Mark (DM). This categorical feature indicates the approximate balance tier, reflecting the applicant's available liquid savings and financial stability. (categorical)
- foreign_worker: Indicates whether the applicant is a foreign worker, a categorical feature with values 'yes' or 'no' that may influence credit risk assessment based on employment stability and residency status. (categorical)
- checking_status_label_encode_duration_multiply: (numerical) A derived numerical feature representing the product of the encoded categorical value for 'checking_status' and the original 'duration' of the credit in months. This feature combines the influence of the applicant's account status with the length of the loan, potentially capturing interaction effects where the risk associated with the account status is modulated by the loan term.
- other_parties: Indicates the presence and type of any additional debtors or guarantors associated with the credit application. This categorical feature identifies whether the applicant has co-signers or other parties who share liability for the loan. (categorical)
- employment: Current employment status categorized by duration in years, with possible values: '<1' (less than one year), '1<=X<4' (between one and four years), '4<=X<7' (between four and seven years), and '>=7' (seven years or more). (categorical)
- residence_since: The number of years the applicant has been living at their current residential address (numerical). This feature indicates residential stability, where a higher value may suggest greater stability and potentially lower perceived risk.
- existing_credits: The total count of loans or credit lines currently held by the applicant at this same financial institution, including both active and ongoing obligations (numerical integer)
- housing: Current housing situation of the applicant, indicating their type of residential accommodation (e.g., renting, owning, or living for free) (categorical)
- credit_history_age_label_encode_multiply: (categorical) A repeated concatenation of the string value from the 'credit_history' field. The number of repetitions is determined by multiplying a label-encoded version of the 'credit_history' category by the applicant's 'age'. This results in a long, compounded text string representing the credit history classification.
- credit_amount_duration_divide_residence_since_sqrt_plus: (numerical) A derived numerical feature calculated by first dividing the credit amount by the loan duration, then adding the square root of the number of years the applicant has resided at their current address. It represents a composite measure that normalizes the loan amount per month of repayment, adjusted for the stability implied by the length of residence.
- checking_status_employment_label_encode_plus_reciprocal: (numerical) A derived numerical feature calculated by first summing the label-encoded integer representations of an applicant's checking account status and their employment duration category, then taking the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of that sum. This transformation emphasizes smaller combined label values by giving them a larger reciprocal result, potentially highlighting cases with more favorable checking and employment conditions.
- duration_age_plus_checking_status_label_encode_multiply: (numerical) A derived numerical feature calculated by first multiplying the encoded categorical label for the applicant's checking account status by a numerical value, and then adding the product of the applicant's age in years and the duration of the credit in months. It represents a composite risk indicator that combines age, loan term, and financial standing.
