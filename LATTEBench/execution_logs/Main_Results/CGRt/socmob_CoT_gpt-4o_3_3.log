You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Proprietor, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Manager, Craftsman-Construction, Laborer-Manufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Operative-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Salesman-Retail, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Farm_Laborer, Craftsmen-Other, Service_Worker, Salesman-Nonretail, Professional-Salaried, Clerk]

- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
