You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very cpu-bound programs. Predict the portion of time that cpus run in user mode from all attributes.
