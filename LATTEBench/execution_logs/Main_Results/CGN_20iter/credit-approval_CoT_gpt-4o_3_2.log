2025-12-22 10:57:23,882 - INFO - LLM Output: Here's how you can generate new features that could improve the predictions of credit card application success:

1. <DebtToIncomeRatio><divide><Debt><Income><Debt to income ratio which indicates the proportion of income that goes into debt repayment. Lower values are usually better for creditworthiness.>

   Reasoning: The debt-to-income ratio is a key metric in understanding someone's ability to repay debts. By observing the proportion of income that is already going into debt repayment, we can assess the likelihood of successful credit card applications. Typically, lower ratios are considered favorable.

2. <FinancialStability><plus><CreditScore><Income><A combined measure of financial soundness, considering both credit score and income level. Higher values indicate better financial stability.>

   Reasoning: Both credit score and income are important indicators of financial stability and creditworthiness. By combining these two, we can create a feature that captures an individual's overall financial soundness. Individuals with a good credit score and higher income are generally more likely to obtain credit cards.

3. <EmploymentFactor><multiply><Employed><YearsEmployed><Measurement of employment stability by multiplying employment status with years employed. Higher values indicate stable employment which is a positive factor for credit applications.>

   Reasoning: Employment stability is crucial in determining creditworthiness. By multiplying employment status (1 for employed, 0 otherwise) with years employed, we capture both current employment status and employment history in a single feature. Longer periods of stable employment usually lead to successful credit card applications.

2025-12-22 10:57:28,079 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <AgeDebtInteraction<multiply<Age<Debt<Interaction_between_Age_and_Debt_for_credit_card_application>
   - This feature captures the interaction between age and outstanding debt, providing a measure of the burden on individuals. The hypothesis is that younger individuals with higher debt might face more challenges in being approved for a credit card, as compared to older individuals who might have more financial stability.

2. <IncomeCreditRatio<ratio<Income<CreditScore<Income_to_Credit_Score_ratio>
   - This feature provides a direct comparison between an individual's scaled income and their scaled credit score. A low income combined with a high credit score might imply good financial management, potentially leading to a successful credit card application. Conversely, a high income with a low credit score might indicate financial mismanagement.

3. <EmploymentStabilityScore<subtract<YearsEmployed<PriorDefault<Measure_of_Employment_Stability_risk_factor>
   - The feature considers the difference between years employed and prior default history. Individuals with longer employment history and no prior defaults are likely to have more financial stability, increasing the chances of a successful credit card application. This feature provides a balanced view of employment stability against the risk of default.

2025-12-22 10:57:51,325 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible steps for generating new features:

1. <EmploymentYearsCreditScoreInteraction><multiply><YearsEmployed><CreditScore><Interaction_between_years_employed_and_credit_score_to_capture_compounded_effect_on_success_rate>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the compounded effect of job stability (years employed) and creditworthiness (credit score), which can be a strong indicator of financial reliability and therefore credit card application success.

2. <EmployedPriorDefaultInteraction><cross><Employed><PriorDefault><Cross_product_of_Employment_status_and_Prior_default_to_capture_combined_effect_on_application_success>
   - Reasoning: The interaction between being employed and having a prior default might reveal complex patterns affecting credit card approval, such as the ability to overcome past financial issues while being employed.

3. <CitizenDriversLicenseBin><bin><Citizen><DriversLicense><Categorical_bin_to_combinate_citizenship_status_with_drivers_license_ownership_effect_on_success_rate>
   - Reasoning: Binning these categorical features can help identify patterns between an individual's citizenship status and their likelihood of owning a driver's license, which may contribute to socioeconomic factors influencing their application success.

   *Reasoning*: Squaring the 'YearsEmployed' feature can help capture non-linear relationships that might exist between the number of years employed and credit card application success. If the relationship is quadratic, this engineered feature can provide additional predictive power to the model.

2. \<CreditScoreEmployedInteraction\>multiply\>CreditScore\>Employed\<Interaction_between_CreditScore_and_Employment_status_to_capture_joint_impact_on_success_rate\>
   
   *Reasoning*: The interaction between 'CreditScore' and 'Employed' may serve as a strong indicator of creditworthiness, as both having a job and a higher credit score could contribute to the likelihood of credit card application success. By multiplying these, we can assess their combined effect.

3. \<ZscoreCreditScore\>zscore\>CreditScore\<Normalized_CreditScore_for_better_outlier_handling_and_model_performance\>
   
   *Reasoning*: Standardizing 'CreditScore' using its z-score can help normalize the feature, making it more comparable across samples and potentially reducing the influence of extreme values. This could improve the model's performance by providing a consistent scale.
