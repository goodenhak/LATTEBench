2025-12-22 11:04:26,219 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Debt_to_Income_Ratio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio_of_Debt_to_Income>
   
   Explanation: The debt-to-income ratio is a commonly used financial metric to assess an applicant's financial stability and borrowing capacity. This feature can help predict credit card approval success by evaluating if an individual's debt is manageable relative to their income.

2. <Normalized_Age><zscore><Age><Age_Normalized_by_zscore>
   
   Explanation: Normalizing the 'Age' using z-score can highlight age-related patterns more effectively by centering the data on mean and scaling according to standard deviation. This transformation can help better capture the relationship between age and the likelihood of being approved for a credit card.

3. <YearsEmployed_Scaled><minmax><YearsEmployed><YearsEmployed_Scaled_between_0_and_1>
   
   Explanation: Scaling 'YearsEmployed' to a [0, 1] range using min-max scaling makes the feature more comparable to other rescaled features such as 'Debt' and 'Income', improving the feature's efficacy in contributing to the model's predictions regarding credit card approval success.

    - Reasoning: Married individuals might have different spending/saving patterns compared to single ones. By interacting with income, we can capture variations in creditworthiness based on marital status and financial situation.

2. <CreditScore_DebtIncomeRatio_Scaled_Interaction><multiply><CreditScore><DebtIncomeRatio_Scaled><Interaction_between_creditscore_and_debt_to_income_ratio_providing_risk_assessment_insights>
    - Reasoning: Individuals with high credit scores and more favorable debt-to-income ratios may have a higher chance of credit card approval. This interaction can capture the impact of credit and financial burden combined.

3. <Industry_Citizen_RoleEncoding><cross><Industry><Citizen><Encoded_interaction_to_identify_common_sectors_and_immigrant_roles>
    - Reasoning: Certain industries may have more immigrants working or may prefer hiring citizens by birth. Understanding the interaction between industry and citizenship status can highlight specific trends or biases in credit card approvals.

   *Reasoning: Creating a ratio of income to debt-to-income ratio can provide insights into the relative balance between earnings and debt burden. It may reveal individuals who have a favorable income level compared to their debt obligations, which can be an indicator of likely success in credit card applications.*

2. \<Citizen_LabelEncoded\> \<label_encode\> \<Citizen\> \<Label_Encoded_Citizen_Status\>  
   *Reasoning: Converting the citizen status into a numerical format may help some models understand this information better. Differences in citizenship status could correlate with credit eligibility (e.g., permanent residents might have different credit histories than temporary ones).*

3. \<DebtIncomeRatio_by_Industry\> \<groupbythenmean\> \<Industry\> \<Debt_to_Income_Ratio\> \<Average_Debt_to_Income_Ratio_by_Industry\>  
   *Reasoning: Calculating the average debt-to-income ratio by industry can provide context to an individual's financial situation relative to their peers in the same sector. This feature could help identify whether someone is financially healthier or more strapped than their industry average, impacting creditworthiness assessment.*

### Reasoning:

1. Log Transformation of Debt to Income: 
   - While the dataset already has a DebtIncomeRatio_Scaled, creating a Debt_to_Income_Log reaffirms the handling of large, skewed data. Log transformations help manage skewness in data better, which may enhance model accuracy by stabilizing variance.

2. Income Scaling:
   - By applying a min-max scaling to Income, this feature is normalized to a 0-1 range, which often benefits machine learning models in terms of convergence speed and performance, especially when dealing with varying scales of data attributes.

3. Industry Encoding:
   - By converting the categorical Industry feature into a labeled number (Industry_Label), the model can learn numerical individual impacts of different industries, accommodating algorithms that do not naturally handle categorical data. The approach enhances compatibility with models that require numerical input while maintaining the distinctions among categories.

2025-12-22 11:05:26,314 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three possible next steps to generate new features for improving the model's performance:

1. \<PriorDefault_Income_Interaction\><multiply><PriorDefault><Income\>Interaction_between_PriorDefault_and_Income
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between having a prior default and income. It may reveal insights into how income levels impact those with a prior default differently compared to those without.

2. \<Married_Education_Rank\><groupbythenrank><Married><Education\>Ranking_of_Education_within_Married_or_Single
   - Reasoning: By ranking the education levels within married and single individuals, this feature could help in understanding the educational attainment distribution within these groups and its effect on credit card applications.

3. \<DebtIncomeRatio_Normalized\><zscore><Debt_to_Income_Ratio\>Z-Score_Normalization_of_Debt_to_Income_Ratio
   - Reasoning: Applying Z-score normalization to the Debt-to-Income Ratio can improve the handling of skewness and variability, making the feature more suitable for techniques sensitive to feature scaling.

2025-12-22 11:05:35,248 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Below are three proposed feature engineering steps designed to potentially improve the prediction model for successful credit card applications:

1. Interaction between CreditScore and Industry
   - <CreditScore_Industry_Interaction><cross><CreditScore><Industry><Interaction_between_credit_score_and_industry_to_capture_sectoral_influences_on_creditworthiness>
   - Reasoning: Different industries might have unique credit score distributions due to income stability and job security. Creating an interaction feature between CreditScore and Industry could reveal patterns where certain industries coupled with particular credit score levels might have higher or lower success rates in application approval.

2. Interaction of Married and DriversLicense
   - <Married_DriversLicense_Interaction><multiply><Married><DriversLicense><Interaction_between_having_a_drivers_license_and_marital_status_to_capture_stability_indicators>
   - Reasoning: Both marriage and having a driver's license can be considered indicators of stability. Multiplying these variables creates a feature that could enhance the understanding of stability's impact on credit card application success.

3. Log Transformation of Income to Reduce Skewness
   - <Log_Income><log><Income><Log_transformation_of_income_to_reduce_skewness_and_handle_outliers>
   - Reasoning: Since Income is highly skewed due to its wide range, log-transforming it can help in normalizing its distribution, potentially leading to better model behavior and insights into how income affects application success.

These steps encompass a mix of interaction terms and transformations to capture hidden relationships and refine existing features' distributions, aiming to improve predictive power.

2025-12-22 11:05:39,398 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. \<Industry_Citizen_Interaction\>\<cross\>\<Industry\>\<Citizen\>\<Interaction_between_Industry_and_Citizenship\>  
   - Reasoning: Interaction terms can often help capture the combined effect of two categorical features, in this case Industry and Citizenship. This can help in identifying certain industry and citizenship combinations that have distinct impacts on credit card application success.

2. \<Income_Scaled\>\<log\>\<Income\>\<Log_transformed_income_for_better_handling_of_skewed_data\>  
   - Reasoning: The log transformation can help stabilize variance and normalize highly skewed features, as is often the case with income. This can aid models in learning more effectively from the data.

3. \<YearsEmployed_Square\>\<square\>\<YearsEmployed\>\<Squared_YearsEmployed_to_capture_nonlinear_effects\>  
   - Reasoning: Squaring years employed allows capturing nonlinear relationships between employment duration and the likelihood of successful credit card application. Longer employment duration might have different impacts which can be captured by nonlinear transformations.

   - Reasoning: By interacting PriorDefault with CreditScore, this feature could help capture the combined effect of previous defaults and credit score on the likelihood of credit card application success.

2. \<Is_Temporary_Employment\><cross>\<Citizen\>\<YearsEmployed_Binned\>\<Cross_of_Temporary_Citizen_and_YearsEmployed_Binned\>
   - Reasoning: Creating a cross feature between a temporary citizenship status and binned years employed captures the impact of short-term employment stability, which may affect credit card application success.

3. \<Income_DebtRatio_Interaction\><multiply>\<Income\>\<DebtIncomeRatio_Scaled\>\<Interaction_between_Income_and_DebtIncomeRatio\>
   - Reasoning: By interacting Income and DebtIncomeRatio_Scaled, this feature could highlight cases where high income is outweighed by high debt, affecting creditworthiness evaluation.
