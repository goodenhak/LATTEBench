2025-12-22 10:56:04,287 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here are three possible feature engineering steps to improve the prediction model's performance:

1. <YearsEmployed_Debt_Ratio<ratio<YearsEmployed<Debt<Ratio_of_years_employed_to_outstanding_debt_for_employment_stability_effects_on_debt>  
   - Reasoning: This feature provides insights into employment duration versus debt levels. Longer employment duration with lower debt may reflect better financial stability, potentially influencing credit card application success.

2. <Income_Age<divide<Income<Age<Ratio_of_income_to_age_for_aging_effects_on_financial_stability>  
   - Reasoning: Analyzing income relative to age may reveal how financially stable an individual is at their age. Higher values may suggest better income accumulation for older individuals, affecting creditworthiness.

3. <Industry_Employment_Cross<cross<Industry<Employed<Interaction_between_industry_and_employment_status_capturing_industry-specific_effects_on_employment>  
   - Reasoning: The cross interaction between industry type and employment status can uncover patterns related to job stability within specific sectors, potentially indicative of the likelihood of credit card application success.

Explanation:

1. AgeMarriedInteraction: Multiplying Age and Married to explore whether marital status influences the effect of age on credit card application success. Often, marital status can impact financial stability which may vary with age. This interaction feature might highlight more predictable patterns.

2. DebtPriorDefaultInteraction: Creating an interaction between Debt and PriorDefault helps in assessing the risk correlation between high debt and previous defaults. A high value in this feature could indicate a higher risk behavior which can be crucial for predicting credit card application success.

3. IncomeBkCustomer: Using a cross operator between Income and BankCustomer helps understand the combined effect of having a bank account and income level on financial stability. Individuals with bank accounts are often perceived as more responsible financially, and combined with their income level, can better inform creditworthiness.
