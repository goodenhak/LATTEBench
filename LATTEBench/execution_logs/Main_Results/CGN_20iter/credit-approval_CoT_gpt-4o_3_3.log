2025-12-22 10:59:29,302 - INFO - LLM Output: 1. <Age_Debt_Interaction><multiply><Age><Debt><Interaction_of_age_and_debt>
   - Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between a person's age and their outstanding debt. Older individuals with similar debt levels might behave differently compared to younger individuals, impacting their credit card application success.

2. <Debt_to_Income_Ratio><ratio><Debt><Income><Ratio_of_debt_to_income>
   - Reasoning: This feature provides insight into how much of a person's income is committed to debt. A higher ratio might indicate financial strain, which could affect credit card approval decisions.

3. <Employment_Stability_Score><plus><YearsEmployed><Employed><Combined_employment_stability_score>
   - Reasoning: By summing the years employed with whether the individual is currently employed, we capture a notion of employment stability, which is often a key factor in creditworthiness assessments.

Reasoning:
1. The interaction between Debt and CreditScore could highlight how these two significant financial health indicators affect credit card application success, capturing nonlinear relationships.
2. Converting EmploymentAndCitizen, a categorical feature, into a numerical format can help models better utilize this information, potentially capturing nuanced effects of status combinations.
3. Adjusting the DebtToIncomeRatio by EmployedYearsRatio might provide more insight into financial stability relative to employment experience, potentially revealing hidden nuances of creditworthiness.

2025-12-22 10:59:56,876 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly, let's strategize some feature engineering steps to potentially improve credit card application success predictions:

1. PriorDefault-Employed Interaction:
   - <PriorDefaultEmployedInteraction<cross<PriorDefault<Employed<CapturesCombinedEffectOfPriorDefaultsAndEmploymentOnCreditCardApplicationSuccess>
   - Reasoning: This feature examines the interaction between having prior defaults and employment status, providing insights into whether these factors together influence credit card application outcomes.

2. DebtAndIncomeScaled:
   - <DebtToIncomeScaled<divide<Debt<Income<NormalizesDebtRelativeToIncomeToEvaluateFinancialStress>
   - <DebtIncomeZScore<zscore<DebtToIncomeScaled<AssessFinancialStabilityByNormalizingDebtToIncomeRatio>
   - Reasoning: Normalizing the debt-to-income ratio can give better insight into the relative financial burden and manageability of debt with respect to income, potentially indicating financial stress affecting credit applications.

3. StabilityFactor:
   - <YearsEmployedToIndustryAverage<ratio<YearsInIndustry<YearsEmployed<RelativeMeasureOfEmploymentYearsToIndustryAverage>
   - Reasoning: The stability factor examines the general employment duration relative to industry standards, reflecting job persistence and potential creditworthiness.

These engineered features are designed to capture critical interactions and normalized metrics that may provide deeper insights into the factors influencing credit card application success.
