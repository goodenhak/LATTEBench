2026-01-12 11:17:53,479 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, the latter feature set includes more basic features (`f0, f1, ... f14`). It appears to be a more comprehensive set by including all original features along with reciprocals and some multiplicative interactions. To further enhance this feature set, we can apply different transformations to capture more complex relationships and interactions between features. Here's a new feature set example, which builds upon the latter set and incorporates more diverse transformations:

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 quan_trans ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 log ,f5 tanh ,f6 cos ,f7 sin ,f8 sqrt ,f9 square ,f10 cube ,f11 sigmoid ,f12 reciprocal ,f13 reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 f14 * f5 *, f2 f10 / f11 +, f1 f3 sqrt *, f8 f9 reciprocal -, f7 f12 log *, f4 f13 cube *, f11 f9 cos *]

In this improved set, we've added some common transformations such as standard scaling (`stand_scaler`), min-max scaling (`minmax_scaler`), and applied various nonlinear transformations (`tanh, cos, sin, sqrt, square, cube`) to capture more complex patterns. Additionally, the interactions between transformed features (`f0 f14 * f5 *`) might provide more predictive insights.

```

Here's the rationale behind some of the transformations:
- Retain f0, f1, f2 to ensure core demographic attributes are preserved.
- Include f8, f9, f10 for employment history-related attributes, enhanced with square and sin transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Add new sin-based transformations on f14 interactions, assuming potential complex relationships with income scaled and other features.
- Incorporate quadratic transformations (f2 square, f6 square, etc.) as they often capture non-linear trends better and can help improve predictions.
- Introduce interaction terms with different transformations (e.g., `f14 f2 square sin * +`) to capture potential relationships between income and other complex behaviors.
  
By integrating and transforming these features in varied ways, complex relationships are captured, which may improve prediction accuracy for identifying successful credit card applicants.

2026-01-12 11:18:24,559 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples and the goal of improving predictions for credit card application success, we will construct a new feature set using various transformations. The aim is to incorporate informative and diverse feature transformations that can contribute to the task.

Here's a new feature set example:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 cos, f0 square, f2 square, f3 square, f4 square, f5 square, f6 square, f7 square, f8 square, f9 square, f10 square, f11 square, f12 square, f13 sqrt, f14 cos square, f14 f2 +, f14 tanh, f13 square, f1 f7 * tanh, f1 reciprocal]
```

Explanation:
- Retained a mix of original features and transformed features to ensure diverse information intake.
- Used different mathematical and statistical transformations like `cos`, `square`, and `tanh` for varied feature sets.
- Included `f1 f7 * tanh` to explore interactions and non-linear effects between Gender and YearsEmployed, simplifying transformation utility in capturing relationships.
- Added `f1 reciprocal` to assess inverted effects of Gender, potentially yielding informative distinguishments for binary categorizations.

These transformations offer a potential combination that might improve the predictions based on leveraging interactions, non-linear transformations, and a blend of original and squared features.

When considering feature engineering in this context, we aim to create meaningful interactions, scale features appropriately, and explore non-linear relationships.

Here’s an improved feature set using feature transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 cos, f13 sqrt, f14 cube, f5 log, f2 sqrt, f12 reciprocal, f11 stand_scaler, f2 f14 +, f9 f13 *, f14 minmax_scaler, f3 f5 *, f7 f10 +, f1 f8 *, f4 square, f6 tanh, f14 sigmoid f11 *, f13 cos]
```

Explanation of some transformations:
- **f14 cube:** Highlights potential high-order non-linear effects of the `Income` (assuming this feature name from context of transformation effects).
- **f2 f14 +:** Interaction between age and income, which could address socio-economic positioning.
- **f6 tanh:** Applying `tanh` on `Industry` (categorical feature as seen from previous data examples) may showcase impacts of certain industries in a smooth, non-linear transformation.
- **f2 sqrt:** Square root of age for better handling age-related variance.
- **f11 stand_scaler:** Standard scaling on `CreditScore` to normalize and emphasize variation.
- **f12 reciprocal:** Applying reciprocal to address heavy skewness present in `DriversLicense` distribution.
- **f3 f5 *:** Interaction between marital status and bank customer status which might impact credit card application success positively.
- **f14 sigmoid f11 *:** Combining income and credit score using sigmoid scaling which could help emphasizing the income threshold effects.

This feature set should provide insightful transformations combining linear and non-linear relationships among the different dimensions of the data, potentially leading to better predictive models.

In this enhanced feature set:

- We've added square, square square, and sqrt transformations to capture various polynomial relationships and potential diminishing or increasing rates in terms of certain features.
- The tanh, cos, and sin transformations can capture periodic tendencies or non-linearities that are characteristic of certain features.
- By including interactions, such as f5 f7 * and f8 f10 *, we aim to capture potential cross-feature correlations that could be meaningful.
- Transformation with reciprocal and log can handle highly skewed distributions or features with wide ranges.
- For scalability and consistency, apply standard scaling where applicable, particularly on features that represent natural rates or magnitudes such as f14.
- Using f6 cube capitalizes on higher-order interactions that might be inherent in some datasets.

Remember that applying these transformations should be supported by exploratory data analysis and domain knowledge to ensure they add meaningful insight into the predictions and do not lead to overfitting.

Explanation:

1. Retain original features: Basics should still be captured without losing essential raw information.
2. `f8 square` and `f10 square`: These retain their transformation from one of the previous examples.
3. `f7 tanh` and `f13 sqrt`: Capture variation in employment years and citizenship status, as in prior examples.
4. `f14 log`: Continuing to apply the log transformation can help with scale variations.
5. `f1 f5 *`: Combining the squared age with the square of the credit score could highlight variations in creditworthiness.
6. `f2 f13 /`: Dividing debt by citizenship could highlight relationships where certain citizenship statuses may handle debt differently.
7. `f3 f9 *`: Multiplying marital status and employment could signal stability of applicants.
8. `f14 sigmoid`: Useful in normalizing skewed distributions.
9. `f12 f6 +`: Summing zip code and ethnicity as it could provide interesting locality and diversity insights.

This combination seeks to improve discrimination potential of the transformed features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 11:18:54,376 - INFO - llm output = Given the previous feature sets, I'll provide a new transformation set that aims to optimize the features for predicting credit card application success. The new feature set aims to incorporate more advanced transformations that could capture nonlinear relationships and interactions, as well as scale the data effectively.

Here is the new and potentially improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f13 square ,f7 cube ,f10 sqrt ,f1 f13 * reciprocal ,f2 tanh ,f8 log ,f6 f14 * minmax_scaler ,f9 sin ,f1 f2 * cos ,f11 sqrt ,f12 sigmoid ,f5 f3 * reciprocal ,f12 f14 * stand_scaler ,f0 f3 * stand_scaler]
```

**Explanation**:
- **f13 square**: Retained from the previous better set, possibly capturing quadratic effects.
- **f7 cube**: Applying a cube transformation may capture higher-order interaction effects in the years employed.
- **f10 sqrt**: Square root transformation can help in normalizing distributions that are heavily skewed, potentially for credit score.
- **f1 f13 * reciprocal**: Interaction between `Age` and `DriverLicense` with reciprocal to explore inverse relationships.
- **f2 tanh**: Tanh can help smooth out extreme values in the Debt feature.
- **f8 log**: Log transformation can stabilize variance and normalize Ethnicity if encoded numerically.
- **f6 f14 * minmax_scaler**: Creating an interaction term between Industry and Income, and scaling it between a fixed range.
- **f9 sin**: Sine transformation can introduce non-linearity for Employed status.
- **f1 f2 * cos**: Interaction between Age and Debt with cosine for potential periodic relationships.
- **f11 sqrt**: Square root transformation for Citizenship, treating it numerically for smoother numerical distribution.
- **f12 sigmoid**: Sigmoid transformation for ZipCode to constrain values and manage outliers.
- **f5 f3 * reciprocal**: Interaction between Married status and BankCustomer with reciprocal.
- **f12 f14 * stand_scaler**: Interaction between ZipCode and Income and standard scaling for normalized relationships.
- **f0 f3 * stand_scaler**: Interaction between Gender and BankCustomer with standard scaling to control for variance. 

This feature set attempts to blend linear and nonlinear transformations, scaling techniques, and interactions which can enhance model predictive power by capturing complex dependencies between features.

Here is a proposed improved feature set:

```

Transformations added or emphasized:
- Continue use of subtraction combinations involving `f13` to highlight interaction effects.
- The `f0 f11 /` transformation captures interactions related to employment and licensing.
- `f12 reciprocal` helps accentuate the relationship of citizenship type.
- `f9 f9 sin` offers periodic transformations on employment status.
- Introduce product interaction: `f1 f2 *` emphasizes gender and age interaction.
- Logarithmic transformations `f8 log`, `f9 log` help handle skewness and scale variance especially for `YearsEmployed` and `PriorDefault`.

This feature set aims to enhance the capability of the model by capturing non-linearities, interactions, and transformations that might provide valuable insights into the credit card application success patterns.

**Explanation:**
- Leverage squared features as from both examples for capturing non-linear relationships.
- Include sin and tanh transformations for capturing periodic and saturation behavior respectively.
- Retain useful interactions and transformations like `f13 stand_scaler`, `f13 f2 -`, and `f13 f14 -` which could highlight the impact of prior default and employment status.
- Introduce multiplicative and divisive interactions `f5 f9 *`,`f7 f10 /`, to explore the interplay between debt, employment, and credit score.
- Incorporate a logarithmic transformation (`f12 log`) to handle extreme values and potential skewness in zip code data.

2026-01-12 11:19:37,292 - INFO - llm output = To construct a better feature set based on the given two examples, we can integrate elements from both while also considering transformations and interactions that may enhance predictive power. Given that the latter example is described as better, I will prioritize features from that set while adding meaningful transformations and interactions from the former example.

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f0 f1 + ,f2 f4 * ,f5 cube ,f6 tanh ,f7 log ,f8 sqrt ,f9 reciprocal ,f10 f11 + ,f12 f14 * , f13 square ,f14 tanh]
```

Explanation:
- The base features (f0 to f14) from both examples are preserved.
- Interactions and nonlinear transformations are introduced (like `f0 f1 +`, `f2 f4 *`, `f5 cube`, etc.), inspired by transformations like square and interactions in the first feature set.
- Prioritized transformations such as tanh and square due to their potential to model nonlinear relationships and variability.
- Added diverse transformations such as reciprocal, cube, and log to capture more complex relationships.

Given the two examples, here's a suggested improved feature set:

1. **Expanded Operations**: Added `f8 minmax_scaler` and `f10 stand_scaler` to introduce scaling transformations which can help normalize some of these features' values.
2. **Maintained Interaction Terms**: Kept interaction terms involving subtraction and squaring, as interactions between features can capture complex relations useful for prediction.
3. **Diverse Set**: Included a diverse subset of features from both examples provided. This includes more operations on existing features to create new patterns and relationships.
4. **Additional Transformations**: Strengthened diversity by applying uncommon transformations (`sin`, `cos`) within squared terms to potentially reveal unique periodic relationships.
5. **Balanced Selection**: Ensured selection from across the original features (`f0` to `f14`) while diversifying operations to enhance feature richness.

Explanation:
1. Basic inclusion of original features: Keep original features to avoid losing potentially important information.
2. Sigmoid transformation on f14 (Income): It emphasizes the non-linear distribution of income, which might influence credit card application success.
3. Square transformation on f1 (Age) and log transformation on f14 (Income): These transformations help normalize highly skewed distributions.
4. Reciprocal transformations on f3 (Debt) and division operation on f5/f6: Useful to capture inverse relationships.
5. Use tanh, cos, and multiplications (f1 cos f7 tanh *): These operations create complex non-linear interactions that might capture deeper patterns.
6. Standard scaling of f4 (Married) and min-max scaling of f10 (CreditScore): Good for normalizing the range of values of crucial features.
7. Cube transformation of f9 (PriorDefault): This amplifies the effect of features where extremity might bear significance.
8. Combined sqrt transformations on f2 (Debt) and f8 (YearsEmployed): Creating interaction terms can enhance capturing underlying relationships.

```

Explanation of additions and transformations:

1. **`f2 f0 /`**: Introduced division between two features to capture interactions.
2. **`f13 f14 - minmax_scaler`**: Used min-max scaling after subtraction to keep features within the same range.
3. **`f13 f0 - tanh`**: Applied tanh to enhance non-linear relationships after subtraction.
4. **`f2 minmax_scaler sin`**: Combined scaling and sinus transformation for complex feature interaction.
5. **`f4 minmax_scaler sigmoid` & `f5 minmax_scaler sqrt`**: Used different transformations to capture the distribution changes effectively.
6. **`f8 minmax_scaler reciprocal`**: Captures inverse effect on scaled features.
7. **`f9 minmax_scaler stand_scaler`**: Normalizes data further after scaling, emphasizing standardization.
8. **`f11 minmax_scaler cos` & `f12 minmax_scaler sin`**: Trigonometric transformations post-scaling could aid in periodic pattern capture.
9. **`f14 sqrt tanh sigmoid`**: Applies multi-step transformations for highly non-linear feature creation.
10. **`f4 stand_scaler cube`**: Used for more complex relationship modeling.

In this new feature set, I have attempted to incorporate essential elements from both examples:

1. Basic feature transformations like square, cube, and logarithm for capturing non-linear patterns.
2. Interaction terms such as `f10 f7 * f12 +` and `f0 square f2 + f7 tanh +` to evaluate cross-feature relationships.
3. Scaling and transformation techniques like `stand_scaler` and `quan_trans` for improved normalization and distribution favorability.
4. Incorporation of complex expressions like `f3 f4 + square` and `f12 square f2 + sigmoid` for capturing higher-order trends and sigmoidal relationships, potentially reflecting decision boundaries like those in neural networks.

Remember, while creating new feature sets, it's important to validate and interpret the performance improvement they provide on real model predictions, also considering computational efficiency and overfitting risks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:20:45,935 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the two examples provided, we can incorporate transformations that might capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. This involves using a variety of transformations and ensuring we're not overusing a single method to avoid redundancy. Here’s a proposal for a new feature set:

```
[f1 ,f2 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 sqrt ,f1 sin ,f14 tanh ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f13 f1 - ,f2 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f9 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f11 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f14 sqrt stand_scaler ,f1 sin stand_scaler ,f14 tanh stand_scaler ,f14 stand_scaler stand_scaler ,f13 f1 - stand_scaler ,f14 sqrt tanh ,f1 square f6 * ,f8 f9 / ,f9 f10 +]
```

Key Changes and Justifications:
1. **Stand Scaler vs MinMax Scaler**: Opted for `stand_scaler` instead of `minmax_scaler` for some features to ensure normalization considering mean and standard deviation instead of just range. This might perform better for features with skewed distributions.
2. **Feature Interaction**: Added interaction terms like `f1 square f6 *`, which could potentially capture hidden patterns between age and whether or not a person has prior defaults.
3. **Combination of Operations**: Added `f8 f9 /` and `f9 f10 +` to introduce relationships between debt, employment status, and credit score that might be useful for classification.

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: Retain the original features that represent fundamental aspects of the individuals.
- **Mathematical Transformations**: Apply `sqrt`, `square`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` to various features to capture nonlinear relationships and effects.
- **Scalings**: Include scaled versions such as `minmax_scaler` to standardize features for improved model convergence.
- **Interactions**: Create interaction terms like `f13 f14 -` and `f9 f10 *` to capture relationships between different features.
- **Composite Transformations**: Use combinations like `f14 sqrt tanh` to explore potential higher-order interactions.
- **Log and Reciprocal Transformations**: Provide transformations like `log` on selected features to manage skewness and scale disparities.
- **Combinatory Features**: Include combinations like `f13 f2 /` and `f0 f14 sqrt *` to examine richer data representations.

1. Involving multiplicative interactions to capture potential correlations or synergies between features like `f2 f7 *` (YearsEmployed and Ethnicity).
2. Introducing division and subtraction interactions to discern relationships, such as `f1 f10 /` and `f1 f9 -`.
3. Including a log transformation to handle skewness or emphasize meaningful relationships (`f13 f12 log`).
4. Utilizing reciprocal and square root transformations for numeric stability and insightful scaling (`f1 log`, `f1 f13 reciprocal`, `f0 sqrt`).
5. Preserving unique non-linear transformations such as `f14 sigmoid` for any potential feature distribution accommodations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:21:10,155 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, the goal is to construct a new feature set that potentially offers better predictive power for identifying successful credit card applicants. The second example seems to provide more variety in the transformations and arithmetic operations applied to the features, which typically leads to more complex interaction modeling.

Here’s a proposed feature set incorporating and enhancing the transformations seen in both examples:

```
[f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f13 ,f14 ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f5 square ,f6 square ,f7 square ,f8 square ,f9 square ,f10 square ,f11 square ,f14 sin ,f13 f2 - ,f13 f14 - ,f2 square square ,f5 square square ,f8 square square ,f9 square square ,f10 square square ,f11 square square ,f13 f2 - square ,f13 f14 - square ,f14 sin square ,f14 tanh ,f7 f3 / ,f10 sqrt]
```

The improvements included:
- Added trigonometric transformation `f14 tanh`, seen as potentially valuable for modeling non-linearities.
- Added division of `f7` by `f3` (`f7 f3 /`). This operation may capture interaction between these two numerical features and showcases potential normalization/scaling effects.
- Added square root transformation of `f10` (`f10 sqrt`) to stabilize variance and maintain distribution symmetry. 

These enhancements aim to emphasize non-linear transformations and interactions found beneficial in predictive models.

```

Here are some considerations and changes:

1. **Keep Core Features**: The essential features from both examples are retained to preserve potentially important predictive attributes.
2. **Enhancement using Logarithms**: The logarithm transformation on `f12` (Income) is beneficial for handling skewed distributions often associated with income, providing potentially better insights when squaring this transformation and using it in conjunction with square root.
3. **Combination of Features**: New combinations like `f5 f7 +` (Married plus YearsEmployed) and `f10 f2 -` (CreditScore minus Age) provide an opportunity to capture interactions between features that are known to influence credit card application success.
4. **Multiple Transformations**: Continuation of applying transformations such as squares, logarithms, and square roots provides non-linear complexity that might capture hidden patterns or relationships.
5. **Sigmoid Transformations**: Maintaining sigmoid-based transformations can help constrain certain features within the range of [0,1], potentially improving model performance where threshold-based evaluations are crucial.
