2026-01-12 11:32:35,930 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given examples of feature set transformations, we can observe that the latter example forms a more complex and potentially more informative set of features by incorporating logarithmic transformations, interactions with `f14`, and mathematical transformations like `cos`, `sqrt`, and `square`.

To further optimize and enhance the feature set, we'll build on the second example by introducing additional transformations that could capture more subtle and nonlinear relationships in the data, such as composite transformations, additional interactions, and scaled transformations:

```
[f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f1 log, f1 log log, f1 log log log, f0 f14 *, f2 f14 *, f3 f14 *, f4 f14 *, f5 f14 *, f6 f14 *, f7 f14 *, f8 f14 *, f9 f14 *, f10 f14 *, f11 f14 *, f12 f14 *, f1 log f14 *, f1 log log f14 *, f1 log log log f14 *, f2 cos, f14 sqrt, f14 square, f1 log sqrt, f1 log log sqrt, f2 sqrt, f10 * f14 sqrt, f3 * f3, f8 tanh, f8 sigmoid, f12 f14 cube, f6 minmax_scaler, f1 f2 *, f0 f10 +]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Additional Log and Square Root Transformations**: Applying additional transformations like `sqrt` to log-transformed features (e.g., `f1 log sqrt`) can help normalize skewed distributions and provide new perspectives on the feature's impact.

2. **Interaction Terms**: Generating more interaction terms (e.g., `f10 * f14 sqrt`, `f1 f2 *`) allows the model to capture complex relationships between different features. 

3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Using transformations like `tanh` and `sigmoid` allows us to capture non-linear relationships, particularly for features that might influence outcomes in a non-linear fashion (e.g., `f8 tanh`, `f8 sigmoid`).

4. **Scaled Transformations**: Including scaled features can help handle features that vary across different scales (e.g., `f6 minmax_scaler`).

These adjustments and additions aim to provide the model with a richer set of features, capturing both linear and non-linear relationships which could be predictive of the credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 11:32:54,635 - INFO - llm output = To improve the predictive power of the feature sets based on the given examples, we need to focus on combining relevant features using transformations that enhance their signal related to credit card application success:

Consideration from the examples:
- Quantile transformations and tanh functions have been used frequently to tackle skewed distributions and nonlinear relationships.
- Combination of features using arithmetic operations and advanced transformations like log and sqrt can help capture complex interactions.

Building upon this, here's a new improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f8 ,f10 ,f14 ,f8 f10 * ,f8 f14 * ,f10 f14 * ,f1 f10 log * ,f5 f14 square + ,f2 f14 - sqrt ,f3 f8 / ,f6 f10 sqrt ,f7 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f9 f10 * tanh ,f10 f14 * tanh ,f1 log log log f14 * tanh ,f8 f10 * tanh ,f10 f14 sqrt tanh ,f14 sqrt f10 tanh sigmoid]
```

**Explanation:**

1. Directly use the features `f8`, `f10`, and `f14` (YearsEmployed, CreditScore, and Income) as they are crucial indicators, potentially related to financial reliability and creditworthiness.

2. Multiplicative interactions (`f8 f10 *`, `f8 f14 *`, `f10 f14 *`) to capture complex relationships between these continuous features.

3. Log transformations combined with multiplicative interactions (`f1 f10 log *`) and additions of squared features (`f5 f14 square +`) to leverage feature expansion and interaction.

4. Subtractions and square roots (`f2 f14 - sqrt`) can help maintain interpretability while enabling the detection of nonlinear trends.

5. Use divisions (`f3 f8 /`) and square roots (`f6 f10 sqrt`) to explore ratio relations and nonlinear scaling.

6. Apply tanh nonlinearity frequently on these combinations (`f7 tanh`, `f8 tanh`, `f10 tanh`) to harness their bounded range properties in emphasizing extreme values.

7. Extend combinations further by using tanh and sigmoid on refined features (`f10 f14 sqrt tanh`, `f14 sqrt f10 tanh sigmoid`), targeting better feature distribution for the learning algorithm.

This enhanced feature set aims to capture significant relationships and complex patterns that are likely to improve the model’s predictive performance for credit card application success.

2026-01-12 11:32:59,707 - INFO - llm output = To enhance the feature set for predicting successful credit card applications, I'll generate a new feature set leveraging transformation techniques that are potentially insightful for this task. Building a feature set involves focusing on deriving meaningful new features or scaling techniques that can capture complex patterns behind success in credit card applications based on the given features:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 quan_trans, f14 sqrt, f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f11 minmax_scaler, f12 minmax_scaler, f14 quan_trans minmax_scaler, f14 log, f1 square, f12 f10 /, f14 f6 f1 * -, f3 f2 log +, f8 f7 cube +, f1 f5 sqrt +]

Explanation:
- I have kept the transformations from the previous examples that might be effective for scaling and normalizing features, such as 'minmax_scaler', 'quan_trans', and 'sqrt'.
- I've added 'log' and 'square' transformations to capture nonlinear relationships with respect to the target variable.
- I included operations like division (f12 f10 /) to observe interactions between features that may influence credit card application success.
- Subtraction involving transformed features (f14 f6 f1 * -) and addition with log-transformed features (f3 f2 log +) explore complex relationships and differences between various aspects.
- Cubing a feature (f8 f7 cube +) captures extreme values potentially useful for modeling unusual circumstances regarding user profiles.
- The combination of 'sqrt' transformation with addition (f1 f5 sqrt +) attempts capturing subtle thresholds related to the features.

This enhanced feature set intends to encompass multiple transformations that could better help the downstream model capture the intricacies and influences tied to credit card application success.

```

Explanation:
- Retained both original features (f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14) and transformed versions that apply non-linear scalers (e.g., tanh, sigmoid) or mathematical operations (e.g., sin, square, cube).
- Included transformations like `quant_trans`, `cos`, and `log` for complexity and capturing non-linear relationships.
- Minimized redundancy by selecting transformations that feed features into multiple non-linear operators to capture varied feature interactions.
- Retained transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `sigmoid` on `f14` for output range control, which could align well with credit card applications based on behavioral data normalization.

```

Explanation:
1. I kept the base features (f5, f7, f8, f10, f14) which cover important aspects regarding employment, debt, and income that are likely relevant when considering credit card applications.

2. The use of `f5 square`, `f13 square`, and `f8 square` allows exploration of nonlinear relationships, which is promising in understanding how these numerical features influence the outcome.

3. Transformations like `f14 sigmoid` and `f10 tanh` can highlight potential saturating effects or boundaries in credit score and employment features.

4. Combining advanced operations like `f13 cube quan_trans`, `f13 cos quan_trans`, and several logarithmic transformations (`f7 square log`, etc.) could reveal deeper insights into the scale and distribution variation effects on relationships.

5. Interactions like `f5 f10 -` and `f5 f10 - cos` explore feature differences and periodic transformations to capture additive and cyclic effects.

This set aims to capture complex interactions and nonlinearities while ensuring important features remain represented.

**Explanation of Additions:**

- **`f14 sqrt`**: Applying a square root transformation can be useful for right-skewed data and may help in normalizing the feature used to predict application success.

- **`f10 log`**: The logarithm transformation is often effective for positively-skewed features such as `CreditScore`, which may enhance model robustness, especially if there's a large variance in that feature.

Both transformations aim to improve the linearity and normality of our dataset features, which is useful for many machine learning algorithms.

[f7 ,f8 ,f10 ,f14 ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f9 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f5 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f7 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f8 stand_scaler tanh ,f9 stand_scaler tanh ,f10 stand_scaler tanh ,f2 f7 * ,f2 f8 * ,f2 f8 stand_scaler * ,f2 f9 stand_scaler * ,f2 f10 stand_scaler * ,f2 f8 tanh * ,f2 f9 tanh * ,f2 f7 stand_scaler tanh * ,f2 f9 stand_scaler tanh * ,f2 f10 stand_scaler tanh * ,f2 f0 f8 stand_scaler * * ,f2 f8 stand_scaler tanh * ,f2 f9 stand_scaler tanh * ,f2 f10 stand_scaler tanh * ,f14 cube]
```

### Explanation:
- **Original Features Used:** `f7`, `f8`, `f10`, and `f14` are retained. These seem to be significant given their recurrence in both feature sets.
- **Scaled Features:** Include standardized versions of features using `stand_scaler` to account for varying scales.
- **Non-linear Transforms:** Use `tanh` for its non-linear squashing properties, making features more expressive.
- **Interactions:** Maintain feature pair interactions and incorporate them with transforms like `stand_scaler` and `tanh` for better modeling of complex relationships.
- **Cubing Operation:** Retain `f14 cube`, as larger power can help model polynomial relationships and interactions effectively.
- **Combinations:** Mix of product terms and combinations of standardized and tanh-transformed features, enhancing non-linear interaction capabilities.

2026-01-12 11:33:59,492 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, the goal is to refine and create more advanced features that can potentially enhance the predictive model performance regarding credit card application success. 

Looking at the given examples, we see the usage of feature transformations such as scaling, quantile transformation, mathematical operations, and combinations of multiple features. 

To enhance and expand upon these ideas, we can perform more complex transformations and combinations:

[f5, f6, f7, f8, f10, f14, f7 f1 *, f8 f1 *, f10 f1 *, f14 f0 +, f14 f3 +, f14 f4 +, f14 f5 +, f14 f7 +, f14 f8 +, f14 f9 +, f14 f10 +, f14 f12 sqrt +, f14 f1 log +, f14 f0 f1 * +, f14 f2 f1 * +, f14 f5 f1 * +, f14 f6 f1 * +, f14 f7 f1 * +, f14 f8 f1 * +, f14 f9 f1 * +, f14 f10 f1 * +, f14 f11 f1 * +, f14 f12 f1 * +, f14 f1 log f1 * +, f14 f14 f2 * +, f14 f13 tanh +, f14 cube, f14 f5 log *, f12 sqrt f4 *, f0 f5 f13 * cube, f10 stand_scaler]

This newer feature set example includes:

1. Introducing square root and log transformations to feature f12 (which is presumably useful in certain contexts).
2. Creating complex interactions using cube and multiplication, notably introducing f0, which often influences financial decisions, with other dimensions.
3. Implementing a standardized scaler on f10 to potentially smooth variance and center around a mean.
4. Other complex combinations utilizing basic arithmetic operations to capture non-linear relationships.

By including these transformations, the feature set aims to create more insightful predictors that capture nuanced patterns within the data, improving potential model performance in reliably predicting successful credit card applications.

Taking inspiration from both examples, I'll incorporate different transformations to capture nonlinear relationships and interactions. 

Here's a suggested feature set:

```
[f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f13 ,f14 ,f2 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f7 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f13 tanh ,f14 tanh ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f5 reciprocal ,f6 reciprocal ,f7 reciprocal ,f8 reciprocal ,f9 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal ,f13 reciprocal ,f14 reciprocal ,f0 minmax_scaler sqrt ,f3 minmax_scaler tanh ,f5 minmax_scaler tanh ,f6 minmax_scaler tanh ,f7 minmax_scaler tanh ,f8 minmax_scaler tanh ,f9 minmax_scaler tanh ,f10 minmax_scaler tanh ,f12 minmax_scaler tanh]
```

**Explanation**:

- Basic selection: Retain `f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14` for their potential direct predictive power or interactions.
- `tanh` transformation: Helps in scaling the features non-linearly, smoothing outliers, and capturing nonlinear relationships.
- `reciprocal` transformation: Helps in handling features with potential inverse relationships and reducing dominance of high magnitude features.
- Combined transformations: Using `minmax_scaler` with `sqrt` to focus on compressing feature ranges, especially valuable for skewed distributions, while `minmax_scaler` coupled with `tanh` retains relationships among features already normalized.

2026-01-12 11:34:15,866 - INFO - llm output = To engineer better features based on the given examples, consider combining ideas from normalization and transformation, which can enhance prediction by improving model sensitivity to the features' distributions:

- Normalization techniques ensure that features have similar scales, which helps in machine learning models such as neural networks and k-means clustering. 
- The transformations applied should aim to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the variables, potentially enhancing predictive power when used by models that support interaction terms.

Below is a new set of features that combines normalization and transformations, taking advantage of both examples provided:

```

In this feature set:
- Multiple features are scaled using `minmax_scaler` and then passed through other transformative functions like `sigmoid`, highlighting the importance of scaling as a pre-processing step.
- Using `reciprocal` and `sqrt` captures potential non-linear relationships.
- Combining features with operations (`f0 f1 *`, `f2 f3 *`) before applying transformations can help model interactions between the original features.
- Using both `log` and `sqrt` transformations on interactions and scaled features further ensures robustness by handling skewness and exploring various nonlinear relationships.

This set incorporates transformations that are non-linear and normalization strategies, focusing on feature interactions and non-linearity to potentially capture more complex patterns in the data:

```plaintext
[f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f13 tanh, f14 tanh, f2 cube, f3 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f13 cube, f14 cube, f0 minmax_scaler tanh, f3 minmax_scaler tanh, f5 minmax_scaler tanh, f6 minmax_scaler tanh, f7 minmax_scaler tanh, f8 minmax_scaler tanh, f9 minmax_scaler tanh, f10 minmax_scaler tanh, f12 minmax_scaler tanh, f6 f10 *, f9 f8 /, f14 log, f13 sqrt, f2 f5 +, f3 f7 -]
```

The transformations include:

1. **Non-linear transformations (tanh, cube)**: Applied to make features more expressive and capture non-linear relationships.
2. **Normalization strategies (minmax_scaler)**: To ensure consistent feature scaling and prevent dominance by features with larger numeric ranges.
3. **Feature interactions**: Multiplies and divides select features favorably. Also adding and subtracting pairs to emphasize interactions and potential correlations between selected features.
4. **Logarithmic and square root transforms**: Log is applied to stabilize variance and handle skewness; square root helps moderate imbalances.

These transformations may better highlight the relationships and patterns between these variables and the target outcome, which is the success in applying for a credit card. Adjustments could be further optimized based on actual model feedback and predictive results.

```

Modifications include:

1. Added `f13 sqrt`, which may help capture nonlinear interactions involving `Income` and its associated scaled transformation.
2. Transformed `f2 minmax_scaler sqrt`. This involves scaling followed by taking the square root, adding more nuance to its distribution.
3. Introduced `f14 cube minmax_scaler`, creating a cubic transformation before scaling, capturing potential polynomial effects in `Income`.
4. Applied `log` transformation with `minmax_scaler` on `f3`, potentially capturing exponential relationships related to `Married` status. 

These changes aim to provide better feature representation and capture complex behaviors potentially missed in previous examples.

2026-01-12 11:34:42,296 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two examples provided, we can observe an expansion from the previous feature set with the addition of a cube transformation in the latter example. To further improve the feature set, we aim to include transformations that capture more complex interactions and distributions:

Adding non-linear transformations, scaling, and interaction terms can potentially enrich the feature set. Here's a new feature set suggestion:

```

### Explanation:
- **f14 f5 stand_scaler +**: Applies standard scaling to the feature f5 and enhances it with f14, which helps in normalizing feature values.
- **f14 f9 log +**: Takes the logarithm of feature f9, giving insight into exponential growth patterns, and combines it with f14.
- **f14 f11 sqrt +**: Applies square root transformation to feature f11 to reduce skewness and combines it with f14.

These transformations can help reveal hidden patterns and enhance the predictive power of the model by incorporating non-linear relationships and scaling-derived interaction features.

In this improved feature set:

1. Applied scaling, transformations, and mathematical operations judiciously to uncover hidden patterns and interactions.
2. Introduced transformations from the quantitative and scaling processing (e.g., `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`) and mathematical operations (e.g., `cube`, `sqrt`) in relation to significant features.
3. Implemented interaction terms based on potential relationships (e.g., multiplying features together before applying a transformation, or combining them through addition post-multiplication).
4. Carefully chose logarithmic transformations to maintain numerical stability and the ability to handle potential variance in scales.

This feature set optimally leverages the individual strengths of transformations and feature interactions to enhance predictive capacity.

2026-01-12 11:34:52,278 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that is likely to improve prediction performance, we can focus on generating meaningful interactions and transformations of the existing features that capture potential relationships between variables relevant to credit card application success. Analyzing the two feature sets given, there are various transformations and operations applied — including interactions between features, logarithmic transformations, and scaling.

For a more effective feature set:

- We can create polynomial features, interactive features, and apply transformations such as logarithm and scaling to capture non-linear relationships and enhance the predictive power of the model.

- Combining scaled, log-transformed features with interactions and non-linear transformations can help capture complex patterns in the data.

Here is an improved feature set including elements from both examples and additional meaningful interactions:

```plaintext

This feature set captures:

- Baseline feature interactions and transformations.
- Logarithmic and scaled transformations to manage distributions.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Explanation:**

1. By using both minmax scaling and quantile transformation, we account for non-linear relationships while maintaining scaled features. It helps in making data distributions smoother and feature values more uniform.
   
2. Additional feature combinations were introduced using operations that extract potential interactions and hidden patterns, for instance, multiplying and adding related features.

3. The addition of non-linear transformations like `sqrt` and `log` enhances feature diversity.

4. Including operations that explore interactions between the features that are more predictive.

This feature set allows a model to leverage diverse representations of the original data to capture underlying patterns effectively.

Based on this, we can create a more comprehensive feature set that incorporates some standardized features for better scalability and variance treatment by using `standard_scaler`. Additionally, using transformations like `log`, `sqrt`, or `tanh` can further help in capturing non-linear relationships. Here's a proposed improved feature set:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 quan_trans ,f0 standard_scaler ,f1 standard_scaler ,f2 standard_scaler ,f3 standard_scaler ,f4 standard_scaler ,f5 standard_scaler ,f6 standard_scaler ,f7 standard_scaler ,f8 standard_scaler ,f9 standard_scaler ,f10 standard_scaler ,f11 standard_scaler ,f14 log ,f13 tanh ,f14 sqrt ,f14 quan_trans standard_scaler]
```

This feature set includes:

- `standard_scaler`: Applied to better center the numerical features around the mean.
- `quan_trans`: To apply quantile transformations for potential outlier correction and feature distribution smoothing.
- `log`: Transformation to reduce skewness in potentially non-normally distributed features.
- `sqrt` and `tanh`: Used for capturing non-linear relationships, ensuring that any parabolic or curve-based relationships are considered.

This new feature set aims to balance the scaling and non-linear transformation of features, offering robust data representations for the predictive task at hand.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:35:02,940 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! Let's create a better feature set considering the operations you mentioned and the existing examples. Here is the improved postfix expression for feature engineering:

```

```

### Explanation:
1. **Added `f14 cube`:** `Income` is a critical feature, and cubing it can help with non-linear scaling and may capture subtle differences in high-income values.
2. **Added `f7 f6 /`:** This feature calculates a ratio between `YearsEmployed` and `Ethnicity`. The idea is to capture the impact of employment duration across different ethnic groups, which may influence the likelihood of a successful credit card application.

In this feature set:
- We've utilized multiplication of selected features to capture potential interactions and synergies.
- We've continued adding some features with `f14` to incorporate income, which is often a strong predictive feature in credit applications.
- We've retained the use of logarithmic transformation and hyperbolic tangent for capturing non-linear relationships.
- We scaled `f7` to standardize that feature, which can help in ensuring numerical stability and potentially improving model performance.

2. Transformation Techniques:
   - Normalize using Min-Max Scaling and Standard Scaling
   - Consider Quantile Transformation for robust scaling
   - Apply non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `cube`, and `sigmoid` to capture non-linear relationships
   - Use the `log` transformation on select features with positive values to handle skewness

3. Constructed Feature Set:

2026-01-12 11:35:20,325 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two examples given, let's focus on incorporating transformations and combinations that might enhance predictiveness. We'll emphasize using quantile transformations for individual min-max scaled features since these can help in normalizing heavily skewed distributions. Additionally, we'll apply some combinations of the essential features using arithmetic operations, while ensuring we avoid multicollinearity and loss of interpretability. Moreover, selected transformations like mathematical functions should focus on improving variance without complicating interpretation unnecessarily.

Here is a new feature set:

[f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14,  
f5 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f12 minmax_scaler,

f2 f6 * f3 minmax_scaler quan_trans,  
f3 f7 f9 + quan_trans]  

Here:
- We maintain the core features implied by the prior selections.
- Using `reciprocal` on features that relate to size/amount (like debt) can invert the distribution.
- `sigmoid` can help scale features into a [0,1] range in a non-linear manner, dealing well with extreme values.
- Having combinations of certain features alongside transformations allows capturing interactions.
- Using `sqrt` on features like scaled credit scores accentuates deviations, potentially highlighting behaviors.
- Combining features can introduce new interactions possibly significant for predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:35:23,847 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we should focus on incorporating meaningful transformations that may capture more predictive power, handling interactions between variables, or encoding non-linear relationships.

Here's an improved feature set based on the given examples:

```json
[f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f10 ,f14 ,f7 f1 * ,f8 f1 * ,f10 f1 * ,f14 f0 + ,f14 f3 + ,f14 f4 + ,f14 f5 + ,f14 f7 + ,f14 f8 + ,f14 f9 + ,f14 f10 + ,f14 f1 log + ,f5 stand_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f13 sqrt ,f14 f5 cube + ,f5 f6 sqrt + ,f7 tanh ,f10 reciprocal ]
```

This feature set maintains most of the transformations from the latter example, with additional transformations for potential better representation such as:

- Including scaling operations (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) which improve model performance by normalizing the data.
- Using `sqrt`, `cube`, and `tanh` transformations on selected features which might capture non-linear relations.
- Applying `reciprocal` transformation on feature `f10` which might be useful to adjust for skewness or specific distribution settings in the feature data.

2026-01-12 11:35:29,312 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets you provided, let's combine the strengths of the latter set and further improve it by considering non-linear transformations and interactions. The latter set incorporates scaling methods like minmax_scaler and quan_trans, which help in normalizing the data, and the inclusion of various features that cover demographics, financial status, and categorical aspects. The first set emphasizes polynomial interactions, which can capture complex relationships between features.

Here's an improved feature set that combines these approaches:

```plaintext
[f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f13 ,f14 ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f5 quan_trans ,f6 quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans ,f9 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f0 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f3 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f5 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f6 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f7 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f8 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f9 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f10 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f12 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f1 f2 * tanh ,f3 f5 * sqrt ,f5 f8 * reciprocal ,f10 f11 * square ,f9 f12 / minmax_scaler]
```

Key enhancements:

1. **Interaction features**: Inclusion of multiplied features with non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sqrt`, and `reciprocal`, which can capture complex interactions and potentially improve predictive performance by modeling non-linear relationships.
2. **Feature diversity**: A mix of mathematical transformations (`square`), scaling methods (`minmax_scaler`), and polynomial interactions (`/` for division variety), which ensure diversified representation of data.
3. **Normalization**: Emphasized use of scaling methods to standardize the data, especially for features that might have large ranges or require normalization for better model performance.
4. **Selection from both sets**: Retained the effective scaling and transformation techniques from the latter feature set while integrating interaction-based features from the first set to create a comprehensive and robust feature set.

- The operations focus on combining features using multiplication and addition to capture interaction terms.
- The `tanh` function is used after combination to introduce non-linearity, which can help in modeling complex patterns.
- The `cube` transformation potentially picks up cubic relationships in the data, which might be beneficial for explaining the target variable.
- Adding `sqrt` after combinations may normalize the dynamic range of features and capture subtle patterns not apparent in linear transformations.
- The `minmax_scaler` is applied before `tanh` to ensure that the input to `tanh` is within a suitable range, thereby avoiding potential saturation issues.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f14 ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f5 quan_trans ,f6 quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans ,f9 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f0 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f3 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f5 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f6 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f7 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f8 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f9 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f10 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f12 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f13 sqrt]

2026-01-12 11:35:48,966 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the provided examples, we need to consider both the transformations used and the diversity of features included. Here is a proposed improved feature set:

- Include all the original features: `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14]`
- Consider useful transformations to capture complex patterns:
  - Scaling transformations for numerical features to ensure they are on similar scales: `[f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f11 minmax_scaler, f12 minmax_scaler]`
  - Quantile transformations can be valuable to address skewness: `[f14 quan_trans, f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans]`
  - Combining different transformations for more advanced feature representation: `[f14 sqrt, f14 quan_trans minmax_scaler, f0 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f1 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f3 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f5 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f6 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f7 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f8 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f9 minmax_scaler quan_trans]`
  - Feature ratio or interaction terms can enhance feature representation: `[f5/f1, f7/f2, f9*f14, f3*f10, f8*f11]`
  
Collectively, this should provide a more robust feature set to enhance predictive performance in determining successful credit card applicants:

2026-01-12 11:35:54,909 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set considering the two examples provided, I'll aim to retain and enhance informative transformations while ensuring we do not overly complicate the set. I'll include some of the more complex transformations that might capture non-linear relationships, like the cube, and introduce new relevant transformations.

Here's an improved feature set:

```
[f5, f6, f7, f8, f10, f14, f7 f1 *, f8 f1 *, f10 f1 *, f14 f0 +, f14 f3 +, f14 f4 +, f14 f5 +, f14 f7 +, f14 f8 +, f14 f9 +, f14 f10 +, f14 f1 log +, f14 f0 f1 * +, f14 f2 f1 * +, f14 f5 f1 * +, f14 f6 f1 * +, f14 f7 f1 * +, f14 f8 f1 * +, f14 f9 f1 * +, f14 f10 f1 * +, f14 f11 f1 * +, f14 f12 f1 * +, f14 f1 log f1 * +, f14 f14 f2 * +, f14 f13 tanh +, f14 cube, f1 f8 *, f14 log, f8 sqrt]
```

Key additions and rationale:
- **`f1 f8 *`**: Introduces an interaction term between age and employment, which might be informative.
- **`f14 log`**: The logarithmic transformation of income may help to capture the relative differences in income better.
- **`f8 sqrt`**: Square root transformation of years employed, which can be useful to capture diminishing returns of employment duration.
