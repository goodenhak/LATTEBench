you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f22 tanh ,f0 cos ,f1 cos ,f2 cos ,f3 cos ,f4 cos ,f5 cos ,f6 cos ,f8 cos ,f9 cos ,f10 cos ,f11 cos ,f12 cos ,f13 cos ,f16 cos ,f17 cos ,f18 cos ,f19 cos ,f20 cos ,f21 cos ,f23 cos ,f24 cos ,f25 cos ,f26 cos ,f27 cos ,f28 cos ,f30 cos ,f31 cos ,f32 cos ,f33 cos ,f34 cos ,f35 cos ,f36 cos ,f37 cos ,f39 cos ,f40 cos ,f22 tanh cos ,f29 sqrt ,f14 sqrt ,f38 sqrt ,f29 f22 *]

2026-01-12 15:28:08,412 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature transformation examples, I'll create a new feature set by incorporating meaningful transformations. The aim is to enhance the predictive power by using non-linear transformations, combination of features, and possibly reducing dimensional space with operations like cosine and cube. Here is an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 tanh ,f29 cube ,f38 sqrt ,f15 f29 / ,f14 square ,f9 log]
```

Explanation:
- **f7 tanh**: The `tanh` transformation helps to handle non-linearity.
- **f29 cube**: Cubing can capture higher order interactions and enhance the representation.
- **f38 sqrt**: Square root can help scale the feature, decreasing its range significantly.
- **f15 f29 /**: Division creates interaction terms which could capture relative relationships between features.
- **f14 square**: Squaring can help capture quadratic effects which might be useful for modeling complexity in the data.
- **f9 log**: Logarithm is useful to reduce skewness and manage wide-ranging data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Here, we've shifted to a model that uses both scaling and mathematical transformations after aggregation and subtraction operations. The inclusion of diverse cos-based transformations and interactions attempts to capture non-linear relationships.
- This reflects a more multi-faceted approach to feature engineering, where a balanced set of transformations and combined terms influences model learning in different and potentially enriching ways.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
- I've included a square root transformation (`sqrt`) for two features (`f14` and `f38`), which can help with variability and potentially normalize skewed data.
- Used addition operations with pairs of features, which may uncover meaningful linear relationships or interactions between these pairs.
- Included division operations towards the end, similar to the previous example, as this operation often unveils ratio-based insights.
- Retained a broad set of initial features to maintain diversity and potential for rich interactions.

This feature set is designed to capture complex relationships and interactions among the features, which can enhance the ability of a predictive model to generalize well on the biodegradable classification task.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:28:50,839 - INFO - llm output = In order to improve the performance of the feature set, let's look at incorporating transformations that can potentially enhance model predictions. The following feature set incorporates a broader range of transformations, which can capture non-linear relationships and improve feature representation. Here's a new feature set combining some of the previous transformations and additional ones:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 log ,f38 log ,f7 f7 + ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f13 sqrt ,f15 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f21 sqrt ,f23 sqrt ,f24 sqrt ,f25 sqrt ,f26 sqrt ,f28 sqrt ,f30 sqrt ,f31 sqrt ,f32 sqrt ,f33 sqrt ,f34 sqrt ,f35 sqrt ,f36 sqrt ,f37 sqrt ,f39 sqrt ,f40 sqrt ,f14 log sqrt ,f38 log sqrt ,f7 f7 + square ,f7 f7 + sigmoid ,f7 sigmoid ,f0 quant_trans ,f1 quant_trans ,f2 quant_trans ,f3 quant_trans ,f4 quant_trans ,f5 quant_trans ,f6 quant_trans ,f7 quant_trans ,f8 quant_trans ,f9 quant_trans ,f10 quant_trans ,f11 quant_trans ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f7 tanh]
```

In addition to the transformations from the original suggestions, this new set includes quantile transformation to robustly scale features and tanh transformations, which are good for handling non-linear relationships. These operations aim to enhance the representational capacity for the model, while maintaining manageability of feature complexity.

In this set, I've included operations that could capture different interactions and nonlinear transformations such as division, reciprocal, and the combination of different scalers, which might be beneficial to capture unique patterns within the data. Additionally, operations like `sqrt` and `minmax_scaler` could help normalize the data distribution for improved model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This new set incorporates:
- Trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tanh`) for capturing periodic relationships.
- Basic arithmetic and geometric operations (`*`, `+`, `reciprocal`, `cube`, `square`) to derive new interactions between features.
- The use of `minmax_scaler` to normalize features while maintaining scale relationships.
- Further interaction terms and nonlinear transformations combining multiple existing features.

By experimenting with such transformations, we can attempt to enhance the predictive power of the feature set for the biodegradability classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set introduces interactions with `f29` and `f14`, applies `tanh` transformation to `f22`, and includes a cube transformation on an interaction between `f29`, `f22`, and `f7`. It also maintains a mix of basic arithmetic operations, scaling, trigonometric transformations, and potentially informative transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `sqrt`.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Explanation:**
- I added a few mathematical transformations to the existing feature set: 
  - `f0 sqrt`: This ensures features with potentially large values are scaled down, helping stabilize calculations and models sensitive to large values.
  - `f24 reciprocal`: Reciprocal transformation can be effective for handling skewed data, especially if inverse relationships with the target are suspected.
  - `f31 log`: Log transformations compress the data space, often helping with linear separability assumptions and reducing skewness.
  - `f17 cube`: Cubic transformations could potentially capture complex interactions between features.

The goal of these augmented transformations is to improve feature diversity and potentially reveal hidden patterns that can improve the predictive power and precision of subsequent models.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:29:34,260 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! To generate a more informative feature set by leveraging transformations, let's consider the operations applied in your examples and create a sophisticated combination:

* In the first example, the feature at index `f22` is interacted with itself using subtraction (`f22 f22 -`). This transformation doesn't effectively enhance its informational contribution for most models and might simply result in a zero (unless `f22` itself is zero). 
* In the second example, the operation applied is a sine transformation on `f7`, which could be useful if the underlying data has periodic characteristics or if normalization helps to improve model performance.

Now, Let's build upon these transformations and propose a new set of features:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 sin ,f8 square ,f9 log ,f10 reciprocal ,f11 tanh ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f13 cube ,f14 sqrt ,f15 quan_trans ,f16 f22 f19 + ,f17 f9 f11 / ,f18 stand_scaler ,f19 sigmoid]
```

Explanation:
- `f7 sin`: Drawing from Example 2 where sinusoidal transformation is applied to `f7`.
- `f8 square`, `f9 log`: Applying square and logarithm transformations offer potential non-linear relationships.
- `f10 reciprocal`, `f11 tanh`, `f12 minmax_scaler`: Diverse transformations to explore different ways of normalizing data.
- `f13 cube`, `f14 sqrt`: Using cube and square root transformations for more complex feature interactions.
- `f15 quan_trans`: Quantile-based transformation can help normalize skewed distributions.
- `f16 f22 f19 +`: Interaction between `f22` and `f19`, exploring additive relationships.
- `f17 f9 f11 /`: Interaction involving division for enhanced contrast or normalization.
- `f18 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling for uniform feature preprocessing.
- `f19 sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation for bounded outputs, often assisting with binary outcomes.

```

Key enhancements:
- **Stand-scaled Feature**: Stand-scaling (`f15 stand_scaler`) standardizes the feature, aiding in models sensitive to feature scaling.
- **Non-linear Transform**: Using `tanh` on aggregated features helps capture non-linear relationships.
- **Log Transform**: Applying `log`, especially on sums, stabilizes variance and handles skewness, beneficial for model predictions.

Incorporating non-linear transformations (`tanh`, `log`) alongside scaling (`stand_scaler`) can improve model accuracy by enhancing feature interpretability and discovery of hidden relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:
1. Retained original features from f0 to f40 as they contain essential information about molecular descriptors.
2. Added `f14 cube` and `f38 cube` to potentially emphasize nonlinear effects.
3. Calculated `f22 f29 -` to find the difference between two features, potentially revealing interactions.
4. Used `f7 tanh`, `f22 f29 - tanh`, and `f22 f29 - f22 - tanh` to capture potential nonlinear effects and complex interactions related to biodegradability in complex molecules.
5. Included `f7 sin` for periodic pattern encoding that might be relevant for interactions among atoms.
6. Leveraged `f22 f22 f29 - f22 - - tanh` which considers complex interactions involving multiple features, chaining differences and transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:30:03,403 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set that might be more informative for your downstream task, we can enhance the transformations used in the second example. Here's a suggestion:

- Utilize mathematical transformations such as logarithm, cube, and sigmoid, which may offer non-linear relationship insights.
- Apply scaling techniques to normalize features, aiding in model convergence.
- Combine these transformations with basic arithmetic operations to facilitate interaction terms that could improve predictive capability.

Here's the new transformed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 f0 sqrt, f1 f1 square, f2 f3 * f4 +, f4 f7 sin, f5 f6 * f7 +, f8 f9 / f10 +, f11 f13 f15 tanh *, f16 f17 reciprocal, f18 f19 stand_scaler, f20 f21 minmax_scaler, f22 f23 quan_trans f24 +, f25 f26 cos f27 *, f28 f29 f30 f31 sigmoid, f32 log f33 / f34 + f35, f36 f37 - f38 cube, f39 f40 sin +, f7 f29 - sigmoid f7 minmax_scaler *, f22 f7 - stand_scaler f7 /]
```

In this transformation:
- Each operation aims to amplify the original feature signals or improve interpretability.
- The use of arithmetic operations in conjunction with other functions allows us to capture more complex relationships between features. This setup is designed to potentially enhance feature relevance and model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Adjustments include:
1. Incorporating transformation for feature `f37` using `square` to capture quadratic relationship.
2. Applying `reciprocal` on feature `f16` to amplify smaller values, potentially useful for features involving rates or proportions.
3. Adding interaction features such as `f38 f29 +` and `f33 f30 *` to potentially capture synergistic effects.
4. Including `f6 f10 /` to explore the ratio between two features, may highlight varying scale effects.
5. Using `sqrt` for feature `f37` to identify subtle variations effectively.
6. Applying `tanh` on `f21` to manage extreme values efficiently.
7. Introducing combined operation `f36 f32 + cube` to explore complex polynomial relationships. 

These changes aim to provide more comprehensive insights for model learning and improvements in predictive accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:30:19,674 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, the approach should combine useful transformations while possibly exploring new transformations to capture underlying data patterns better. Here's a synthesized and improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 quan_trans ,f38 quan_trans ,f7 f29 * ,f7 tanh ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f14 f22 + ,f38 f22 + ,f22 f7 + f14 f22 + + ,f0 cos ,f1 cos ,f2 cos ,f7 tanh f14 f22 + * ,f7 minmax_scaler f38 quan_trans + ,f30 quan_trans]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Integrating Transformations:** The new feature set integrates the `quan_trans` and `tanh` transformations, which can capture complex distributions and non-linearities.
   
2. **Combining Additive Functions:** Continued use of additive combinations (e.g., `f14 f22 +`, `f38 f22 +`) helps in exploring interactions between these features.

3. **Applying `cos` Function:** The `cos` operation is kept for potential periodic patterns that might be relevant for some features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`).

4. **Multiplicative and Additive Variations:** The multiplicative feature (`f7 f29 *`) and newly added combination (`f7 tanh f14 f22 + *`) aim to capture multiplicative interactions and their effect post-transformation.

5. **Synergistic Transformations:** Using `tanh` combined with `quan_trans` (e.g., `f7 tanh f14 f22 + *`) allows exploration of non-linear patterns in conjunction with quantile transformations to standardize distributions.

6. **Feature Scaling with Min-Max and Tanh:** The `minmax_scaler` is maintained for scaling `f7` and combined with transformed features to ensure all features are within a similar scale, potentially helping with model convergence and performance.

By combining the essential transformations from both sets and exploring their interactions, this feature set aims to offer diverse representations that could enhance model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:30:26,190 - INFO - llm output = To further improve the feature set, we need to consider the transformations and combinations that can capture more complex relationships between variables. Based on the previous examples, here is a better feature set with added transformations. We've included interactions between some features (product, ratio) and used different transformation techniques for potentially capturing non-linearity or distinct patterns:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 log ,f38 log ,f7 f7 + ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f13 sqrt ,f15 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f21 sqrt ,f23 sqrt ,f24 sqrt ,f25 sqrt ,f26 sqrt ,f28 sqrt ,f30 sqrt ,f31 sqrt ,f32 sqrt ,f33 sqrt ,f34 sqrt ,f35 sqrt ,f36 sqrt ,f37 sqrt ,f39 sqrt ,f40 sqrt ,f14 log sqrt ,f38 log sqrt ,f7 f7 + square ,f3 f10 * ,f4 f9 / ,f7 f14 tanh ,f12 f25 sigmoid ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f5 reciprocal ,f20 quan_trans ,f27 cube ,f2 f13 sin ,f29 stand_scaler ,f34 f36 cos ,f31 f39 / ,f11 f17 f18 * sqrt]
```

In this feature set, operations such as interactions (multiplications and divisions between features), the use of multiple scaling techniques, and various non-linear transformations are employed to capture more complex relationships, enrich the feature space, and potentially improve model performance on the task of classifying chemicals based on biodegradability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:30:31,736 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we should aim to capture complex relationships and variations among features while ensuring that the transformations add valuable insights for predictive analysis. Given the two examples you provided, let's build a transformed feature set by incorporating non-linear transformations and interactions with a particular emphasis on the operations demonstrated:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40,

f22 f29 - f22 f29 - f22 - - f22 f29 - f22 - -, f29 tanh, f22 f29 - f22 - tanh, f22 f29 - f7 - tanh,
f6 f14 +, f13 f15 /, f17 f19 *, f20 log, f24 sqrt, f25 reciprocal, f16 f40 minmax_scaler, f26 f28 quan_trans,
f30 f32 + f34 cube, f31 f33 f35 * tanh, f26 f36 / sigmoid, f30 f37 f38 * /, f39 log, f38 f40 cos, f20 f27 -, f6 sqrt]
```

This new feature set combines various strategies:

1. Basic arithmetic operations to capture interactions between features.
2. Non-linear transformations such as `tanh`, `sin`, `cube`, `sqrt`, and `log` to warp the feature space.
3. Feature scaling techniques (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`, `sigmoid`) to standardize and normalize data.
4. Incorporation of complex interaction terms.

This set should provide enhanced predictive power by revealing deeper insights into the data structure that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Explanation of added transformations:
- `f0 f1 + log`: Adds and logs the combined values of `f0` and `f1`.
- `f2 f6 * sqrt`: Computes the square root of the product of `f2` and `f6`.
- `f38 f37 / cube`: Divides `f38` by `f37`, then cubes the result.
- `f13 square`: Squares the feature `f13`.
- `f7 f22 f40 - sqrt * sigmoid`: Subtracts `f40` from `f22`, takes the square root, then multiplies by `f7`, and finally applies the sigmoid transformation.

These transformations introduce non-linear interactions that may capture complex dependencies and improve feature richness for the classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:30:49,378 - INFO - llm output = To construct a "better" feature set using postfix expressions, I will incorporate diverse transformations from both examples while maintaining a compact set that generates potentially informative features. The challenge is to leverage meaningful interactions and non-linear transformations while avoiding excessive redundancy. Here's a new feature set informed by your previous examples:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f9 ,f10 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f19 ,f21 ,f22 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f40 ,f7 f29 * ,f38 f22 + ,f14 f22 + ,f22 f7 + ,f38 f22 + reciprocal ,f29 f7 * cos ,f22 f7 + f38 f22 + + ,f22 f7 + f14 f22 + + ,f22 f7 + f14 f22 + + sin ,f22 f7 + f38 f22 + + sin ,f30 f22 + ,f0 cos ,f1 cos ,f8 cos ,f10 cos ,f12 cos ,f13 cos ,f14 cos ,f16 cos ,f17 cos ,f19 cos ,f21 cos ,f23 cos ,f24 cos ,f26 cos ,f27 cos ,f30 cos ,f31 cos ,f32 cos ,f35 cos ,f36 cos ,f37 cos ,f38 cos ,f39 cos ,f40 cos ,f7 cos ,f22 f7 + f14 f22 + + cos ,f22 f7 + f38 f22 + + cos ,f15 minmax_scaler ,f38 quan_trans ,f7 tanh ,f7 minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Features**: Retain a subset of original features for their potential value (selected from both examples).
  
2. **Interactives**: Use interactive features like `f7 f29 *` and `f38 f22 +` which extend the feature space meaningfully from prior examples.

3. **Reciprocal Transformations**: Include reciprocal transformations like `f38 f22 + reciprocal` as these can highlight feature inversion effects.

4. **Trigonometric Interactions**: Utilize trigonometric transformations (`cos`, `sin`) applied to composite features to capture periodic patterns or oscillatory behavior.

5. **Advanced Composite**: Combine interactions such as `f22 f7 + f14 f22 + +` to create compounded interactions, followed by trigonometric functions for enhanced non-linear feature capture.

6. **Normalization and Scaling**: `minmax_scaler`, `tanh`, and `quan_trans` are used on selected features to help stabilize models by reducing sensitivity to scale, capturing relative importance.

This new setup attempts to balance feature complexity with potential utility, avoiding redundancy but exploring interactions deeply.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This improved feature set uses a variety of operations for transformation and scaling, incorporates nonlinear transformations like `tanh` and `sin`, and combines features with operations to generate potentially informative composite features. Additionally, `minmax_scaler` is utilized to ensure that features are scaled appropriately, which may help with model convergence and prediction performance.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:31:06,906 - INFO - llm output = To propose a better feature set, let's build on the complexity introduced in the latter example while introducing meaningful feature transformations that can capture non-linear patterns and interactions among variables. 

Here's a new feature set:

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f22 f22 - ,f7 f29 - ,f29 f22 - ,f22 f7 - ,f7 f29 - sigmoid ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f12 log ,f14 log ,f16 log ,f17 log ,f21 log ,f26 log ,f30 log ,f35 log ,f36 log ,f38 log ,f7 f29 - sigmoid log ,f22 f7 - f22 f7 - - ,f22 f7 - f7 - ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f22 f7 - f7 - cube ,f15 sqrt ,f15 f29 / ,f23 f24 * ,f40 tanh ,f40 f3 + ,f2 f19 / sigmoid ,f30 f31 + f32 + ,f33 stand_scaler ,f34 reciprocal, f35 f5 / ,f25 f1 * ,f37 f36 cos ,f8 quan_trans]
```

In this proposal, the new transformations and combinations enhance the capacity for capturing nonlinear dependencies and feature interactions:

- `f15 sqrt`: Square root transformation applied to enhance scale sensitivity for feature interactions.
- `f15 f29 /`: Interaction between feature 15 and 29 using division to capture ratio-based relationships.
- `f23 f24 *`: Multiplication to capture product-based interactions between features 23 and 24.
- `f40 tanh`, `f40 f3 +`: Use of tanh non-linearity on feature 40, combined with an additive interaction with feature 3 to model both effects.
- `f2 f19 / sigmoid`: Division followed by sigmoid function to scale the transformed feature in range [0, 1].
- `f30 f31 + f32 +`: Summation to capture linear combinations of features.
- `f33 stand_scaler`: Standardization for feature 33, to normalize the data considering mean and standard deviation.
- `f34 reciprocal`: Applying reciprocal to invert transformations, helpful for very large quantities.

Additional enhancements can be made based on more domain-specific insights about chemical interactions or model performance with the dataset to iteratively refine feature transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:31:13,267 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that is better based on the given examples, I will focus on using transformations that enhance or reduce dimensionality while potentially capturing non-linear relationships. Given the operations available, the transformations can include element-wise operations like `sigmoid`, `log`, and `minmax_scaler`, as well as interactions between features with basic arithmetic operations.

Here's a new improved feature set:

```

Here's the explanation of the transformation techniques used:

- Incorporated `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` for non-linear transformations to emphasize nonlinear relationships.
- Additionally applied sequential transformations like `sqrt` on `sigmoid` and `tanh` for potential feature enhancement.
- Incorporated basic arithmetic interactions between certain feature pairs.
- Added `sin` and `cos` transformations for cyclic or periodic relationships.
- Utilized `log`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` to manage feature distributions and potential relationships not evident through linear correlations.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:31:19,953 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets provided, we can create a new feature set by integrating useful transformations that could improve the predictive power while maintaining diversity among the features.

Here is the proposed feature set:

```

**Explanation**:
1. **Incorporating scalers**: Both min-max and standard scalers are used to give more flexibility in data distribution adjustments for the original features `f15` and new derived feature `f29 f7 *`.
   
2. **Additional transformations**: `sqrt` and `reciprocal` are added to select features such as `f10` and `f38` to explore non-linear relationships.
   
3. **Trigonometric and Logarithmic transformations**: Continued use of `sin`, `tanh`, and `log` based transformations to enhance non-linear and varied feature representation.
   
4. **Avoid redundancy**: Retained only necessary transformations that might help discern non-linear patterns while maintaining a balance of transformations that capture diverse relationships.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:31:25,435 - INFO - llm output = When modifying feature sets for enhancing predictions, it's crucial to focus on transformations that may enhance the model's ability to capture underlying patterns in the data. The provided feature sets demonstrate transformations via logarithmic adjustments and interaction terms. The latter example introduces interaction terms between features which can capture nonlinear relationships and dependencies, likely improving predictions.

Combining ideas from both, here's an improved feature set that leverages these strategies:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f22 f7 - ,f22 f7 - f22 * ,f14 log ,f38 log]
```

This feature set combines the interaction term introduced in the second example with the logarithmic transformations from the first, expanding the feature space and potentially capturing both linear and nonlinear relationships more effectively.

2026-01-12 15:31:33,400 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the given feature set transformations, we can strategically apply transformations that capture more variance and interactions between features, which can help in improving the prediction power of the model. One approach is to apply dimension reduction techniques, create interaction terms, and additional non-linear transformations. Here's a set of transformed features:

```

Explanation:
- Added interaction terms (`f2 f17 *`), which can capture relationships between two features.
- Applied square root and min-max scaling to features (`f10 f11 sqrt minmax_scaler`) to handle potential non-linearity and normalize values.
- Added cube transformation and min-max scaling (`f6 f32 cube minmax_scaler`) to introduce non-linear terms and normalize.
- Log transformation (`f30 log`) can help reduce skewed distributions.
- Used cosine transformation on another feature (`f14 cos`) to add another non-linear layer. 
- Created additional interaction terms combining previous transformations (`f38 f14 f30 +`).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:

- **Basic Features**: `f0` through `f40` to retain all original information.
- **Transformations**:
  - `f29 f7 *` combines two features by multiplication, which sometimes helps to capture interaction effects.
  - `f22 f7 +` adds two features to capture cumulative effects.
  - `f7 tanh` applies the hyperbolic tangent to potentially normalize the feature in a nonlinear way.
  - `f7 minmax_scaler` scales `f7` to the range [0, 1], which can help with convergence in some algorithms.
  - `f14 quan_trans` applies quantile transformation to normalize the distribution.
  - `f38 quan_trans` applies quantile transformation to another feature, intended to improve the feature's distribution.
  - `f14 f38 *` creates a feature that could capture interaction between `f14` and `f38`.
  - `f14 f7 /` divides `f14` by `f7`, to capture some dependency or ratio.
  - `f22 f10 *` combines two features using multiplication to capture complex interactions.
  - `f7 f29 sqrt *` combines `f7` and `f29` after applying a square root to `f29`, providing a non-linear interaction.
  - `f38 f29 sqrt *` similar reason for combining `f38` and `f29`.
  - `f21 f26 +` adds features to capture linear interaction.
  - `f31 f32 -` subtracts one feature from another to capture differences.
  - `f29 f35 tanh +` combines a nonlinear transformation with an addition.
  - `f9 f12 -` captures the difference between `f9` and `f12`.

This set aims to create diverse, potentially powerful features by using different transformations and combination strategies, which is beneficial for complex datasets like this one.

### Explanation:
- The new feature set focuses on creating interactions and transformations that could potentially capture complex relationships.
- **Square, sqrt, log, tanh, sigmoid**: Used these transformations for non-linear mappings which can enhance model learning.
- **Interaction Terms (e.g., f22 f7 \***): By including interactions, we aim to capture relationships between features that may jointly impact the target.
- **Division (e.g., f27 f7 f22 * /)**: Including ratios or normalized forms often helps balance scales of different features and captures proportionate relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:32:03,510 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using the given transformations and operations, we can combine some operations to form potentially more insightful features for the classification task. Here's a new, enhanced feature set example:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 cube ,f38 cube ,f14 f0 * sqrt ,f38 f2 + tanh ,f7 f9 / reciprocal ,f15 f16 * log]
```

**Explanation:**
- Combined operations such as `f14 f0 * sqrt` can potentially capture interactions between features in a non-linear way, which might be useful for classification.
- Operations like `f38 f2 + tanh` can add non-linearity to the feature set, which is often beneficial in modeling complex behaviors.
- Ratio using `f9` with reciprocal can help control for scale and emphasize relative differences, while reciprocal might help with inverted relationships.
- Multiplying features and applying logarithm can transform multiplicative relationships into additive ones, capturing different types of feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:32:15,449 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we need to focus on the transformations that would likely aid in improving the model's predictive performance. Considering the two examples provided, we can fuse efficient transformations from both examples and introduce additional transformations to capture more variance and interactions in the data. 

Here is a proposed better feature set combining both examples and adding relevant transformations:

```

Here's the reasoning behind this transformation choice:
1. **Sigmoid and Log Transformations**: From the first set, transformations like sigmoid and log are maintained as they often help compress the range and handle skewed distributions.
2. **Addition of Sqrt**: Square root is added as it can help in normalizing variance, especially in features showing quadratic effects.
3. **Feature Combinations**: Interaction terms (products) are introduced to capture potential feature interactions that could be significant for prediction (e.g., `f22 f40 *`).
4. **Stand Scaling and Min-max Scaling**: These scalings are preserved for standard normalization and ensuring variables are on similar scales while maintaining computational stability.
5. **Subtraction of Features**: Includes combination operations from both examples which show potentially valuable feature interactions that beginners or experts might not manually check. 

These transformations and combinations strive for capturing non-linear inteactions and scaling various ranges, collectively aiding in improved model generalization.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 quan_trans ,f38 quan_trans ,f7 f29 * ,f7 tanh ,f7 minmax_scaler]
 
 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 quan_trans ,f38 quan_trans]

2026-01-12 15:32:23,380 - INFO - llm output = To enhance the predictive power of your feature set, let's apply some feature engineering techniques based on the two given examples:

Start with both original feature sets:
- Keep all original features: `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40]`

Now integrate feature transformations seen in both examples and add additional transformations:

1. Quantile transformation of features for handling non-normal distributions:
    - `f14 quan_trans`, `f38 quan_trans`

2. Feature interactions for capturing non-linear relationships:
    - `f7 f29 *`

3. Normalization techniques for scaling the features:
    - `f7 minmax_scaler`

Additional Transformations:
4. Apply `log` transformation on a feature to handle skewness and spread approximately normally distributed data:
    - `f5 log`

5. `stand_scaler` for standardizing features based on z-score normalization:
    - `f32 stand_scaler`

6. `cube` and `sqrt` transformations for exploring non-linear relationships:
    - `f18 cube`
    - `f31 sqrt`

7. `sigmoid` transformation for squashing the feature range:
    - `f12 sigmoid`

8. Combining multiple features using arithmetic operations for interaction exploration:
    - `f3 f8 + f13 f21 *`

Final improved feature set representation:
```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f14 quan_trans, f38 quan_trans, f7 f29 *, f7 minmax_scaler, f5 log, f32 stand_scaler, f18 cube, f31 sqrt, f12 sigmoid, f3 f8 + f13 f21 *]
``` 

These engineered features should offer more informative patterns for downstream tasks and enhance the prediction capabilities in your classification model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:32:28,489 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, let's incorporate additional transformations that can enhance the dataset for the prediction task while maintaining the format. We'll build on the latter set, as it's considered better, and add further meaningful transformations:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f22 f14 + ,f22 f38 + ,f7 sqrt ,f7 square ,f7 f7 - ,f7 sigmoid ,f7 cos ,f15 f7 + ,f14 f38 * ,f8 f9 / ,f40 tanh ,f16 reciprocal ,f19 cube ,f37 minmax_scaler]
```

In this enhanced feature set:
- `f14 f38 *` introduces interaction between two features, which may capture underlying dependencies.
- `f8 f9 /` introduces a ratio aspect which is often valuable in understanding proportional relationships.
- `f40 tanh` applies a tanh transformation that can help in stabilizing variance and managing outliers.
- `f16 reciprocal` inverts the values of a feature which might provide a different perspective on its distribution.
- `f19 cube` applies a cubic transformation to explore nonlinear relationships.
- `f37 minmax_scaler` scales values to a [0,1] range, making them comparable across similar transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:32:41,753 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature transformation examples provided, we will further enhance the approach by combining arithmetic expressions with nonlinear transformations to capture complex interactions while preserving numerical stability. Here is the improved feature set:

```

```

In this improved feature set:
- We are using combinations of arithmetic expressions with nonlinear transformations like `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, `log`, `tanh`, and scalers like `quant_trans`, `minmax_scaler`, and `stand_scaler`.
- Feature interactions are being captured by arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- We introduce complex interactions by combining arithmetic operations with transforms, capturing potential nonlinear dynamics between the features.

This enhanced feature set aims to improve the predictive power by transforming and interacting existing features to capture complexity in the data which might be related to the classification task (biodegradability in this case).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Apply transformations for additional insights:
  - Apply logarithmic transformation on features to manage skewed distributions:
    - [f0 log, f1 log, f12 log, f17 log, f21 log, f26 log, f30 log, f35 log, f36 log]

- Combine sigmoid and tanh transformations:
  - [f7 sigmoid tanh]

- Leverage division for ratio insights:
  - [f7 f30 /, f22 f8 - f7 -]

By combining subtraction and logarithmic transformations, we aim to capture underlying patterns and comparative relationships between features. Applying sigmoid and tanh transformations enhance the non-linear transformations to capture complex relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

1. `f14 f38 * sqrt`: Consider the square root transformation of the product between feature f14 and f38, which could help in capturing non-linear relationships.
2. `f22 f14 f7 + ++ stand_scaler`: Adding f14 and f7 to f22, followed by stand_scaler; this standardizes the summed feature, potentially enhancing the predictive power by centering and scaling it. 

This new feature set aims to incorporate transformations and combinations that were previously successful while enhancing others with potentially beneficial operations like square root and standard scaling.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:33:00,711 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, I have studied the transformations used in the second example and can propose a better feature set for improved predictive performance. The second example employs additional transformations such as square root, square, and sigmoid, which are beneficial for capturing non-linear relationships. Here's an augmented transformation:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f22 f14 + ,f22 f38 + ,f7 sqrt ,f7 square ,f7 f7 - ,f7 sigmoid ,f7 cos ,f15 f7 + ,f16 tanh ,f18 reciprocal ,f20 log ,f8 tanh f10 + ,f12 stand_scaler ,f21 cube]
```

In this proposal, I've added:

- `tanh` of feature `f16`, which can help in normalizing the output and emphasizing the middle range of values, useful for handling extreme values.
- `reciprocal` of feature `f18`, to handle possible inverse relationships.
- `log` of feature `f20`, often used to reduce skewness and manage exponential growth patterns.
- `tanh` of feature `f8` added to `f10`, introduces a non-linear transformation interacting with another feature.
- `stand_scaler` of feature `f12`, which aids in standardizing the data and might improve model convergence.
- `cube` of feature `f21`, introducing a higher order interaction which can capture more complex patterns.

These transformations can potentially enhance the feature space and capture more intricate relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

In this improved feature set:
- More diverse transformations are applied, such as `log`, `sqrt`, `minmax_scaler`, `cube`, and `reciprocal`, which can capture non-linear relationships and improve predictive performance.
- Applying `tanh` and `stand_scaler` to multiple features helps stabilize variance and handles outliers effectively.
- Complex transformations involving arithmetic operations such as `f4 f27 /` further create interactions between features, expanding the model's capability to understand complex dependencies.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
