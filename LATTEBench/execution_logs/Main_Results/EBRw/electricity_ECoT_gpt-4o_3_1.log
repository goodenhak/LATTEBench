you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 14:25:36,983 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature transformation examples, we want to create a feature set that is more effective than the two provided sets. The goal is to explore combinations and transformations that enhance the downstream prediction task while adhering to the postfix notation style.

To create a better feature set, consider applying transformations that capture interactions between variables, utilize non-linear transformations, or normalize features to ensure better learning by models. Below is a new feature set designed based on these principles:

```
[f0 f1 + , f2 f3 - , f4 f5 * , f6 f7 / , f1 f4 + sqrt , f2 f5 - tanh , f3 f6 * log , f0 f7 / reciprocal , f0 cube f5 + , f3 cube f4 - , f1 f6 + square , f2 f7 - sigmoid , f4 cube f6 * , f1 f7 + reciprocal , f3 f5 - sqrt , f0 f6 * tanh , f1 f5 + f3 f4 - + , f2 f3 * f5 cube / , f0 f2 + f6 square -]
```

Here are some considerations for this feature set:
- Combinations of features via arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to capture potential interactions.
- Non-linear transformations (e.g., `sqrt`, `tanh`, `log`, `square`, `sigmoid`) to model non-linear relationships.
- A focus on capturing joint relationships between multiple features using nested transformations (e.g., combining transformed features).

[f3 f0 stand_scaler cube sigmoid * f5 square f3 square * - sin , f0 stand_scaler cube sigmoid f3 * f5 square f3 square * - sin reciprocal , f3 f0 square * f3 square f5 * - cos , f3 f0 stand_scaler * f5 f3 * - cube tanh , f0 stand_scaler cube tanh f3 * f5 square f3 square * - sin reciprocal , f0 square f3 * f5 f3 square * log , f0 square f3 * f3 square f5 * log , f0 stand_scaler cube sigmoid f3 * sigmoid reciprocal , f0 stand_scaler cube sigmoid f3 * f5 square f3 square * - sigmoid reciprocal , f3 f0 stand_scaler cube * f5 f3 * - tanh ]
```

In this set:
- We are utilizing combinations of `cube`, `sigmoid`, `sin`, `reciprocal`, `log`, `cos`, and `tanh` to capture non-linear interactions within the data.
- We are also considering standard scaling to standardize specific features before applying these transformations to manage potential skewness or uneven distribution.
- Using such a varied combination of transformations aims to better encapsulate complex dependencies and interaction effects that might affect the label prediction.

The goal is to use different operations to create features that may carry more information or capture patterns not directly visible in the original features.

To create an improved feature set, we can combine elements from both provided examples and potentially add meaningful composite transformations. Here's a new proposition:

```plaintext

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 14:26:56,789 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given two feature set examples, I will derive a new feature set that aims to be more beneficial for the downstream task. Let's take into account, the complexity and expression used in the latter example while simplifying and possibly improving the feature set. The goal is to utilize transformations and combinations that capture non-linear relations and interactions that may be helpful in improving model performance.

Let's design a better feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 f1 + f3 f2 * + , f4 f5 * f6 f7 * + , f0 f3 * f5 / f2 - , f1 f6 / f7 - f4 f3 * + , f0 f4 * f1 f5 + - f2 f6 * + , f3 f7 * f2 f1 f0 + * + , f5 f6 + f0 f1 f3 * + - , f4 f3 * f7 / f2 + , f0 f2 * f6 f3 + - f5 f1 * + , f1 f5 * f0 f4 / f7 + - , f3 f6 * f4 f0 * - f2 f7 / + , f1 f2 * f3 f0 + - f5 f6 + + , f4 f7 * f6 f5 + * f2 f0 - + , f0 f3 / f1 f2 + * f5 + , f7 f4 * f3 f1 / f2 + - , f0 f5 * f6 f2 + - f1 + , f1 f4 * f2 / f3 f5 * + -]
```

*Explanation*:
- Introduced interaction terms between different features considering their possible influence on the outcome.
- Used a mix of arithmetic operations to capture potential non-linear interactions.
- Simplified expressions by reducing repetitive elements and focusing on potentially significant interactions that may not be captured with linear terms alone.
- Ensured that the feature set leverages the various domains of the original features while introducing non-linear components that can enhance the model's ability to understand complex relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f0 f1 + ,f2 f1 + ,f3 f1 + ,f4 f1 + ,f5 f1 + ,f0 f1 + reciprocal ,f2 f1 + reciprocal ,f4 f1 + reciprocal ,f0 f2 * ,f0 f3 * ,f0 f5 * ,f0 f0 f1 + reciprocal * ,f0 f6 f1 + reciprocal *]

The goal is to combine useful operations and feature interactions.

Here's a new feature set based on the given examples:

```

```

Explanation of the key additions:
1. **f3 f4 +**: This combines period and nswdemand in a straightforward manner, potentially capturing their joint impact on price changes.
2. **f4 f5 **: Multiplying nswdemand and vicprice may capture some cross-influence between demand and regional price.
3. **f6 f7 -**: The difference between vicdemand and transfer could help in understanding net regional interactions.
4. **f0 f5 ***: Multiplying date and vicprice might introduce temporal variations in pricing.
5. **f2 f3 + reciprocal**: Adding period and nswprice, followed by a reciprocal transformation, might bring out nonlinear relationships.
6. **f1 f5 /**: Combining day and vicprice through division captures price behavior across different days.
7. **f2 f4 cube**: Cubing the sum of period and nswdemand emphasizes non-linear relationships.
8. **f0 f1 f2 + **: This captures interactions across date, day, and period, emphasizing their possible cumulative effect. 

By integrating these new features, we aim to tap into potential hidden relationships within the data, thus enhancing the feature set's effectiveness for the downstream prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

To provide a better feature set based on the given examples, we'll seek to expand the feature set by applying transformations thought to capture essential patterns or non-linear relationships. We'll incorporate a mix of basic transformations, polynomial expansion, and nonlinear functions that could potentially enhance the predictive power of the model. 

New feature set:

Explanation for selections:
- **f0 f1 +, f2 f1 +, ...**: Basic arithmetic to capture interactions between features.
- **f0 f1 **: Multiplicative interactions could unveil product-related relationships between features.
- **f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, ...**: Square root transformation to help normalize certain skewed distributions.
- **f0 stand_scaler, ...**: Standard scaling to bring features onto a common scale; useful for algorithms sensitive to scales.
- **f2 f3 *, f4 f5 *, f6 f7 ***: Additional interaction terms that may capture synergistic effects between related features.

These engineered features are a step towards diversifying the representation of data, potentially enabling models to grasp patterns that are not immediately evident with the original features alone.

To create an improved feature set, we should logically integrate and extend the transformations used in the latter example. We will incorporate some advanced transformations such as logarithmic scale and sigmoid, which are helpful in stabilizing variance and saturating outputs, and also consider possible interactions between transformed features. 

Here’s a new feature set proposal:

```
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, 
 f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f5 sqrt, 
 f2 f1 /, f3 f1 /, f4 f1 /, f5 f1 /,

 f0 sqrt sqrt, f0 log, f2 log, f3 log, 
 f4 log, f5 log, f3 f4 *, 
 f0 sqrt tanh, f0 sigmoid]
```

This feature set includes the use of square roots, logarithms, and sigmoid transformations, as well as feature interactions such as multiplication. These operations aim to enhance the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships and complex patterns in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

In this combined feature set:
- Mathematical transformations such as `sqrt`, `log`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `cube` are used to explore nonlinear relationships.
- Trigonometric transformations like `sin` are paired with `sigmoid` to capture complex interactions.
- Statistical scales like `minmax_scaler` are applied to standardize values.
- The use of ratios such as `f2 f1 /` and `f5 sin f2 /` helps explore relationships between features. 
- Added `log` and `reciprocal` for potential capturing of other complex dynamics in price.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

### Key Points in the Enhanced Feature Set:

1. **Basic Feature Retention:** Retain basic features that capture fundamental domain-specific information.
   
2. **Non-linear Transformations:** Use of `sqrt`, `cube`, `tanh`, and `log` to model non-linear relationships.

3. **Feature Interactions:** Interaction terms such as `f3 f4 *`, `f2 f5 *` can capture multivariate patterns between features.

4. **Transformations on Ratios:** By applying transformations like `tanh` and `log` on ratios (e.g., `f2 f1 / tanh`), we can capture nuanced behavior which might vary over the scale of input features.

5. **Min-max and Standard Scalers:** Incorporate scaling to ensure features are on a compatible scale for learning algorithms sensitive to magnitudes.

This enhanced set aims to provide a well-rounded feature space that could improve model predictions by capturing more latent relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 14:33:16,465 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given postfix expressions and transformations, we aim to generate a new, more informative set of features that could potentially improve prediction performance. It's essential to create complex features that might capture nonlinear relationships in the data while maintaining computational efficiency. Here's a proposed improvement inspired by the two given sets:

```
[f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * * , f2 f1 + f3 f1 + * , f0 f1 * f2 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * f2 f1 + f3 f1 + * , f3 f1 * f1 + f2 f1 + tanh , f4 f1 + f5 f1 + tanh * , f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * *]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Combination of Features**: We've combined elements from both sets to increase the complexity and potential relevance of the features. This is achieved by performing operations like addition, multiplication, and applying transformations like `tanh`.

2. **Non-Linear Transformations**: Use of non-linear transformations such as `tanh` helps in capturing non-linear relationships, which might be prevalent in the dataset.

3. **Focus on Interaction Terms**: Ensuring interaction between different features like `f0` (possibly date) with several other features, assuming that the interaction could potentially explain variabilities in the outcome.

This newly proposed set aims to harness the existing transformations from both inputs, building upon complex interactions while ensuring that redundant or less informative combinations are avoided.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 14:33:24,687 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the given examples, we should incorporate the useful transformations from both examples and potentially add new ones that increase the feature diversity and non-linearity. 

Here's a proposed feature set that combines elements from both examples and adds a few more transformations:

```
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f2 f1 /, f3 f1 /, f2 sqrt f1 /, f3 sqrt f1 /, f0 sqrt sqrt, f0 tanh, f0 sqrt tanh, f0 sqrt sqrt tanh, f2 sin, f3 sin, f4 cos, f5 cos, f3 log, f4 log, f2 cube, f4 cube]
```

- I've added `f3 log` and `f4 log` to capture the logarithmic transformation which is often useful to handle skewed distributions.
- Added `f2 cube` and `f4 cube` to increase the polynomial degree and introduce non-linear relationships.
- Kept the useful trigonometric transformations (`sin` and `cos`), which can help capture periodic relationships inherent in some time series data (e.g., electricity demand patterns). 

This set should provide a richer feature space for your downstream task.

### Explanation:

- **Retained Transformations**: Kept useful transformations such as `sqrt`, `log`, `cube`, `reciprocal`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` that might uncover non-linear relationships.
  
- **New Feature Combinations**: Added new combinations such as `f4 mean f5 mean +` (average between f4 and f5), and interactions such as `f3 f5 *` which could help in capturing multiplicative effects.

- **Retained Interactions**: Selected and retained interactions between features such as `f3 f4 *`, emphasizing the relationship between `f3` and `f4`.

Each feature transformation is selected considering it's utility in possibly revealing underlying patterns that can help improve model performance for price trend prediction tasks.

[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f2 f1 /, f3 f1 /, f2 sqrt f1 /, f3 sqrt f1 /, f0 sqrt sqrt, f0 tanh, f0 sqrt tanh, f0 sqrt sqrt tanh, f2 log, f3 log, f4 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f3 f5 *, f0 f5 +, f2 f5 /, f3 minmax_scaler, f0 sigmoid, f3 square, f5 cube, f2 * f4]
```

### Explanation of Additional Features:
- **`f2 log`, `f3 log`**: Logarithmic transformations can help capture multiplicative relationships and reduce skewness.
- **`f4 reciprocal`, `f5 reciprocal`**: These can reveal inverse relationships within the data.
- **`f3 f5 *`**: Interaction term to capture combined effects between `f3` (nswprice) and `f5` (vicprice).
- **`f0 f5 +`**: Captures the aggregate effect of date-normalized metrics and transfer between states.
- **`f2 f5 /`**: Another interaction to study the proportional impact of demand and transfer.
- **`f3 minmax_scaler`**: Re-normalizing specific features can highlight their relationships within a smaller feature-space.
- **`f3 square`, `f5 cube`**: Polynomial features of higher degrees could help capture non-linear structure.
- **`f2 * f4`**: Interaction term to understand the joint influence of `f2` (demand) and `f4` (price) metrics.

By refining and expanding on the features provided, this set aims to maximize valuable transformations and interactions for better prediction performance in your task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-13 14:34:45,046 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set that improves upon the given examples, we need to intelligently combine the features while considering important transformations that may enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns. The second feature set builds upon the first by incorporating non-linear transformations and interactions between features. Let's continue to explore this combinatorial approach with further feature engineering:

```plaintext
[f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * * , 
 f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * * ,
 f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * * ,
 f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * * f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * ,

 f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * * ]
```

These additional constructions maintain the multi-level interactions but now also consider strengthening the symmetry and synergy among the different non-linear representations. This can be particularly useful when trying to model complex systems like electricity prices, where there are many interacting factors that could influence the target variable.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

This feature set combines multiple interactions and transformations, using `tanh` to ensure non-linearity. It explores a variety of ways to interact features `f3`, `f4`, and `f5` with others, trying to capture complex patterns that could enhance predictive performance. Additionally, introducing `f2` in some interactions helps to add diversity and further potential complexity to the feature set.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 14:37:40,637 - INFO - llm output = To synthesize a new and improved feature set from the two given examples, we aim to consider combinations that capture non-linear relationships and interactions between the features effectively. Let's consider the features from both examples and create a refined set that leverages these transformations systematically.

Here is a new feature set inspired by the two provided examples:

``` 
[f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f5 f1 + tanh * cube ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 * tanh + f0 f2 * f1 + tanh * sqrt ,f0 f1 * f2 f1 + tanh * f3 f1 * tanh + * cube ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f5 f1 * + f2 f1 * tanh + * sqrt ,f0 f1 * f4 f1 + f0 f1 * f5 f1 + * tanh cube ,f0 f1 * f6 f1 + tanh sqrt log ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f5 f1 * + tanh * sqrt ,f3 f1 * sqrt f0 f5 tanh + * ,f0 f1 * f2 f1 + tanh * f4 f5 tanh + * sqrt ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f6 f2 tanh + * sqrt ]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Non-linearity and Interactions**: The feature transformations capitalize on non-linear interactions, such as multiplications and combinations of transformed features using `tanh`, `cube`, and `sqrt`.
   
2. **Variety of Original Features**: We incorporate a variety of original features across the transformations to ensure diverse interactions and combinations are represented.
   
3. **Complex Interactions**: By using operators like `*`, `+`, `tanh`, and applying them across different intermediary computations, we aim to capture complex relationships between features that a simple linear model might miss. 

4. **Mathematical Transformations**: Usage of `sqrt`, `cube`, and `log` help in normalizing skewness and improving the model robustness by transforming different scales and interactions.

This feature set aims to improve the downstream task's prediction quality by enriching the representation of the data used for modeling.

Let's create a new feature set by combining the robust aspects of the given examples:

```
[f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * * sqrt ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * * cube ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * * ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f3 f1 tanh + sqrt * ,f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 * tanh + * ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f6 f1 + tanh * * sqrt ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f6 f1 + tanh * * cube ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 * tanh + f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * * cube ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * *]
```

In this new feature set:
- I retained combinations involving complex operations like `cube` and `sqrt` to capture non-linear patterns.
- I mixed feature interactions that use multiple base features (like `f3` and `f5`) influenced by `tanh` and combinations to potentially capture various effects of these interactions.
- The feature set attempts a balance between elaborate expressions for depth (`cube`, `sqrt`) and simpler interactions for breadth.

- Use of more complex transformations and combinations.
- Ensure mathematical operations are well-defined (avoid sqrt of negative numbers, log of non-positive numbers).
- Mixing different features to achieve richer interactions.

2026-01-13 14:39:50,842 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and the task of designing a better feature set, a simplistic approach to this problem would focus on ensuring the transformations capture key interactions and preserve more variance. The first feature set employs deeper compositions such as `cube` and `sqrt`, while the second feature set employs simpler multiplicative interactions which can help in capturing linear relationships more efficiently. 

The goal is to create a balanced and efficient feature set by using the strengths of both the provided sets. Hence, the suggested better feature set is:

```plaintext
[f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * * tanh]
```

This suggestion retains useful complexity with terms like `[f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * *]`, which capture interactions between `f3` and `f5` after transformation. It balances straightforward multiplicative terms and simple transformations like `tanh` for capturing non-linear relationships, while avoiding unnecessary over-complexity from operations like `cube` unless significantly beneficial to the feature space.

2026-01-13 14:40:52,886 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the provided examples, we will focus on creating more complex interactions by utilizing combinations of existing transformations.

Given the previous transformations, we can enhance complexity and richness by further combining the transformed features in multiplicative and additive ways. Here's a suggested feature set:

```
[f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * * ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * * ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * cube * ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * cube * ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * * ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * * ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * * ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * cube * ,f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * cube * ,f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * cube *]
```

In this set, we make use of multiple transformations and interactions that were previously proven useful, such as the hyperbolic tangent `tanh` and cubing `cube`, while also introducing combinations of these transformations in multiplicative formats. This approach aims to capture complex relationships and nonlinear interactions among the features for potentially improved predictive performance.

The goal is to create more complex and descriptive features for the downstream task. To achieve this, we'll incorporate various mathematical operations to enhance the expression's complexity and utility.

Let's consolidate and create a new feature set:

1. Combine cube and sqrt operations for greater non-linearity and interaction terms.
2. Utilize tanh and log to introduce non-linearity and handle skewness.
3. Add interactions and combinations from both provided sets to enrich the feature space.

```

In this new feature set, we focus on creating complex interactions and capturing the non-linear relationships among the original features. These engineered features can potentially enhance the performance of machine learning models used for prediction tasks in this context.

2026-01-13 14:41:24,998 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, let's create a new and improved feature set by considering useful operations and combining promising elements from both given examples:

New Feature Set:
```
[f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f4 f1 + tanh * , f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f3 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * f5 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * f5 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f2 f1 + tanh * f3 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f3 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f3 f1 * f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f5 f1 + tanh * f0 f1 * f4 f1 + tanh * * , f0 f1 * f5 f1 * f1 + tanh * f4 f1 + tanh * *]
```

In this set:
- The combinations of different variables (`f3`, `f4`, `f5`) with their respective transformations (`tanh`) are retained and combined to capture interactions.
- Multiplicative interactions between these transformed features aim to capture more complex patterns in the data that can be helpful for improvements in predictions.
- This approach draws on the strengths of both preceding examples by leveraging feature interactions and transformations that were already well-represented.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.
