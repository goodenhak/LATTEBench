you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:

- **Feature Interactions/Products**: 
  - `f2 f7 *`, `f3 f8 *`, `f4 f9 *`, `f5 f10 *`: These combinations might capture interactions between features such as Age and YearsEmployed which could be significant for creditworthiness.
  
- **Square Root Transformations**: 
  - Applied to several numerical features to reduce skewness and stabilize variance.

- **Addition and Multiplication**: 
  - `f0 f1 + f2 *`: Example of creating a composite feature that combines Gender, Age, and another attribute which could indicate demographic tendencies.

- **Log Transformation**: 
  - `f13 log`: Helps manage features with skewed distributions, potentially the ZipCode or a feature representing frequency.

- **Sigmoid Transformation**: 
  - `f14 sigmoid`: Often used for normalizing data to a [0, 1] range, useful for features with extreme ranges.

- **Scaling**: 
  - Standard and Min-Max Scaling are applied to make features more comparable and accommodate models that are sensitive to feature magnitudes.

2026-01-12 11:41:53,709 - INFO - llm output = To construct a more effective feature set based on the given examples, we should consider transformations that capture complex interactions, stabilize variance, as well as enhance the significance of the features for prediction while maintaining computational efficiency. Here is a new feature set based on the analysis of the previous two examples:

Explanation of transformations:
- We maintain the use of raw numerical features (f8, f9, f10) that appear consistently in both examples, as these provide initial context.
- "cube" and "sigmoid" transformations are used to enhance non-linear interactions between features and stabilize variance.
- Extending "sigmoid" transformation sequences captures deeper nonlinear interactions while potentially reducing feature sensitivity to outliers.
- Inclusion of "cube" transformation after sigmoid sequences for selected features aims to enhance the feature’s predictive power by emphasizing significant values.
- This feature set employs a variety of transformations that retain meaningful interactions from the examples and adds complexity efficiently.

```

The selection leverages:

1. **Cube and higher-order powers**: Create higher degree polynomial features that allow modeling more complex nonlinear relationships.
2. **Interactions**: Product interactions between `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, and `f11` to capture potential dealership between different numerical values.
3. **Sine, log, tanh transformations**: To introduce non-linear relationships and pattern extraction.

These combinations are designed to increase the expressiveness of our model and give it the potential to capture more subtle relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:42:06,357 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, here is an improved third feature set using transformations on the original features:

1. Incorporate a mixture of non-linear transformations and interaction terms across various features to enhance signification prediction power.
2. Combine operations that have shown to be effective from previous sets and add more diversity in transformations.

Here is the improved feature set:

[f8, f9, f10, f14, f1 f14 +, f14 sqrt, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f10 tanh, f1 f14 + tanh, f8 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f1 f14 + sin, f1 f14 + tanh sin, f14 sqrt tanh sin sin, f1 f14 + sin sin, f7 tanh sin sin, f8 tanh sin sin, f10 tanh sin sin, f8 sin sin, f9 sin sin, f10 sin sin, f14 sqrt square, f14 sin, f10 cube, f10 minmax_scaler, f14 log, f8 f10 *, f1 f9 tanh *]

Justification:
- Used `tanh`, `sin`, and `cube` transformations along several features which have shown effectiveness in previous examples for capturing nonlinear relationships.
- Combined features using addition and multiplication terms, specifically using the interaction between features like f1 and f14, f8 and f10, etc., to potentially capture synergistic effects.
- Introduced `minmax_scaler` and `log` transformations to enhance interpretability and symmetry across features, facilitating modeled decision boundaries in machine learning models.

2026-01-12 11:42:11,983 - INFO - llm output = In order to improve feature engineering for better prediction performance, we can draw insights from both provided examples to devise a more refined feature set:

1. Utilize combinations of features with meaningful interactions (e.g., multiplication of prominent features like age and debt).
2. Employ scaling methods, both min-max and standard scaling, to normalize ranges and distributions for new feature interactions.
3. Apply non-linear transformations such as sigmoid and square to introduce complexity that may capture nonlinear relationships.
4. Explore stacking multiple transformations, as the second example demonstrated effective use of multi-layered transformations.

Here's a refined feature set for improved predictive performance:

```
[f1 ,f8 ,f1 f8 * ,f1 f8 minmax_scaler * ,f1 f8 stand_scaler * ,f8 stand_scaler minmax_scaler ,f8 sigmoid ,f8 stand_scaler sigmoid ,f1 f8 * sigmoid ,f1 f8 minmax_scaler * sigmoid ,f1 f8 stand_scaler * sigmoid ,f10 minmax_scaler square sigmoid ,f1 f8 stand_scaler * sigmoid stand_scaler ,f1 f8 * sigmoid minmax_scaler ,f1 f8 minmax_scaler * sigmoid minmax_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler square minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler minmax_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler minmax_scaler square ,f1 f10 * stand_scaler minmax_scaler ,f10 tanh stand_scaler ,f1 f8 stand_scaler * minmax_scaler sigmoid minmax_scaler ,f1 f8 * sigmoid minmax_scaler minmax_scaler]
```

In this feature set:
- Interactions between critical features (`Age`, `Debt`, `YearsEmployed`) are prioritized.
- Feature scaling is used to ensure the normalization of values across combined transformations.
- Non-linear transformations like sigmoid are combined with scaling operations to maximize expressiveness and capture subtle nuances in data.

We can leverage mathematical transformations to highlight non-linear patterns, subtraction for interaction effects, and scale some features to control for distribution impacts.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14,

```

Explanation:
- Cube transformations are included for potential non-linear relationships.
- Division features to create interaction terms that normalize or compare sizes.
- Applied standard scaling and min-max scaling to features to potentially improve algorithm interpretation and robustness.
- Additional mathematical operations like square, tanh, cos, and log for non-linear pattern capturing.
- Interactions between features to capture relational dynamics (subtractions and divisions).

2026-01-12 11:42:23,164 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature sets provided and the operations used, I can derive a new feature set that attempts to improve upon the latter set by incorporating elements from both examples and using the operations to create potentially more informative features:

Key additions and changes:
- Incorporated square transformation on f14 to capture non-linear effects.
- Included combinations of transformations using sigmoid on already sigmoid-transformed minmax-scaled features to explore multi-layer activation patterns, which might be inspired by neural network activations.
- Continued to utilize addition between transformed features and feature f2, potentially capturing interactions related to outstanding debt (f2).

This new feature set could potentially capture deeper interactions and non-linear relationships among the original features, which might improve predictive performance for the downstream credit card application success task.

2026-01-12 11:42:27,800 - INFO - llm output = To recommend a better feature set, I'll leverage ideas from both examples. The first list emphasizes trigonometric functions, cubing operations, and transformations like min-max scaling and tanh, while the second focuses on various forms of arithmetic scaling using addition, square operations, and standardization. We'll aim to create a feature set combining advanced transformations while maintaining simplicity and interpretability.

Here's the new feature set proposal:

```
[f1 , f3 , f8 , f10 , f11 , f13 , f14 , f1 sqrt , f14 log , f8 f10 + , f11 f13 - , f14 f13 + , f1 square sqrt , f8 minmax_scaler , f10 reciprocal , f13 f1 stand_scaler , f8 f14 stand_scaler , f14 tanh , f3 f10 * tanh , f11 sin , f14 cos , f8 f1 + cube , f13 f10 - sqrt , f8 sqrt cos , f14 log tanh , f14 log tanh cos]
```

Here's a breakdown of the strategy:
- **Basic Features retained:** Relevant features like f1, f3, f8, f10, f11, f13, and f14 are used as they appeared in both examples indicating their importance.
- **Transformation Techniques:** Using operations like sqrt, log, reciprocal, and cube to transform the original features for better scaling and depth.
- **Combining Features:** New feature combinations using both addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations, creating interactions between the variables for richer data representation.
- **Advanced Scalability/Transformation:** Utilizing stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, tanh, and trigonometric (cos, sin) operations for complex yet potentially more insightful feature derivations. 
- **Simplified and Removed Redundancy:** Avoiding excessive chaining of similar operations while providing variety and depth to the transformations.

Here is the suggested improved feature set:

```

Changes made:

1. Removed redundant feature transformations and combinations that appear in both lists without substantial distinction in their impact, focusing only on promising ones.
2. Kept interactions that are likely significant, such as those involving `f1` and the scaled versions of `f8`, `f9`, and `f10`.
3. Introduced non-linear transformations, such as `tanh` and replaced some `sigmoid` with `tanh`, as `tanh` can provide better gradient flow in neural networks while capturing non-linearity effectively.
4. Retained fewer scaled interactions but ensured diversity in transformations by adding combinations with `tanh` using interactions and important features.

This feature set aims to balance complexity with potentially improved predictive power by harnessing non-linear relationships and interactions.

[f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f13 sqrt ,f14 ,f5 sigmoid ,f6 sigmoid ,f7 sigmoid ,f8 sigmoid ,f9 sigmoid ,f10 sigmoid ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f14 quan_trans ,f2 sigmoid sigmoid ,f5 sigmoid sigmoid ,f7 sigmoid sigmoid ,f8 sigmoid sigmoid ,f9 sigmoid sigmoid ,f10 sigmoid sigmoid ,f13 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f14 quan_trans sigmoid ,f5 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f6 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f7 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f8 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f9 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f10 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f14 quan_trans sigmoid sigmoid ,f5 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f7 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f8 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f9 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f10 sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid ,f14 quan_trans sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid]
```

Changes and rationale:

- Retained `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10` as base features since they seem significant from examples.
- Incorporated `f13 sqrt` for coverage on zipcode which may have non-linear appeal and scaling (minmax_scaler) for range comparison.
- Added transformations on `f6` similar to `f5` due to potential utility across examples.
- Simplified but enhanced `f14 quan_trans` usage to improve both task generality and sigmoid transformation.
- Balanced the complexity of transformations on significant numeric features, aiming for improved discrimination potential while keeping computational cost reasonable.

2026-01-12 11:42:55,082 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature sets you provided, the objective is to maximize the effectiveness of features for predicting successful credit card applications by transforming and combining features into potentially more informative variations. The transformations should aim to capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable while also considering interactions between features.

Here's a new feature set incorporating transformations and combining operations based on the examples provided:

```
[f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f14 ,f8 cube ,f9 cube ,f10 cube ,f14 square ,f13 f8 * ,f13 f10 cube * ,f4 quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans ,f9 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f8 sqrt tanh ,f13 f14 * stand_scaler ,f5 cube minmax_scaler ,f7 cube minmax_scaler ,f9 cube minmax_scaler ,f10 cube minmax_scaler ,f14 square minmax_scaler ,f13 f8 cube * minmax_scaler ,f13 f9 cube * minmax_scaler ,f13 f10 cube * minmax_scaler ,f4 f14 * quan_trans ,f6 cube quan_trans ,f13 f14 sqrt *]
```

This feature set includes various transformations to create potentially more insightful features, emphasizing interactions between existing features. The transformations such as cube, square, and interaction with other features (e.g., multiplication) are chosen to exploit possible non-linear and interaction effects, while scalers are applied to normalize and condense feature ranges to improve model performance.

  - `f13 f1 + stand_scaler square`: Squaring to amplify differences in standardized scores.
  - `f1 minmax_scaler square`: Scale and square to ensure feature variances are properly captured.
  - `f14 sigmoid square`: Further exploring non-linear effects through squaring.
  - `f9 tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent transformation to emphasize middle ranges of prior defaults.
  - `f3 reciprocal`: Using reciprocal to reduce the impact of higher age values.
  - `f8 log`: Applying log transformation to reveal multiplicative relationships in employment status.

```

**Explanation**:
- I've selected variables that seemed to be common in both expressions and added further transformations.
- Introduced scaling (stand_scaler, minmax_scaler) for broad normalization.
- Used sigmoid and log transformations aggressively due to their potential to improve interpretability and performance in binary classification tasks.
- Included reciprocal and cube operations, which could introduce non-linear relationships that capture unique insights.
- Kept the deeply nested transformations for additional nonlinearity.
- Added square root followed by sigmoid to explore additional interaction effects.

2026-01-12 11:43:08,905 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we will consider transformations that promote higher-order interaction and more meaningful representations of the original features. The aim is to leverage non-linear transformations and combinations to capture complex patterns within the dataset, improving model predictions.

Here's a proposed better feature set using the given operations:

```
[f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f13 f8 *, f8 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f9 cube quan_trans cube, f10 cube quan_trans cube, f8 cube quan_trans cube, f13 f8 * quan_trans cube, f13 f14 * quan_trans cube, f14 square, f8 cube cube, f10 quan_trans cube, f13 f8 * cube, f13 log, f14 log, sqrt f14, sqrt f13 f8 *, f13 f14 /]
```

Explanation of key transformations:
- Generated interactions among `f13`, `f8`, and `f14`, potentially capturing meaningful relationships among these features.
- Used logarithmic and square root transformations for smoother scaling and normalizing of some features.
- Applied higher-order cubes and transformed interactions (`cube`, `quan_trans cube`) to capture complex non-linear relationships.
- Included a division operation (`f13 f14 /`) to explore monotonic relationships among the features.

```

Breakdown of new transformations:
- **f10 reciprocal**: Adding a reciprocal transformation may help capture inverse relationships with credit card success.
- **f5 sqrt**: Square root transformation can help stabilize variance and normalize distributions, useful for capturing subtle variations in Income.
- **f13 cube**: Cubing can enhance non-linear effects, potentially capturing interactions in ZipCode related to regional socioeconomic factors.
- **f7 * f9**: Multiplying Gender with Employed could capture interaction terms that are indicative of employment patterns among genders that may influence credit card acceptance.
- **f14 log**: Applying a log transformation might stabilize variance and normalize skewed distributions related to Income, improving model predictions. 

These transformations aim to enrich the feature space, providing better representations for subsequent prediction tasks.

2026-01-12 11:43:27,029 - INFO - llm output = To develop a better feature set for predicting credit card application success based on the given examples, let's focus on capturing interactions between existing features and applying transformations that may reveal nonlinear relationships. The goal is to leverage cube transformations, scaling, and interactions to identify more nuanced patterns.

Here's a new feature set based on the provided examples:

```
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f9 cube, f10 cube, f14 square, f13 f8 *, f13 f9 cube *, f13 f10 cube *, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f14 cube, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f13 f8 * stand_scaler, f13 f9 * stand_scaler, f13 f10 * stand_scaler, f13 f8 cube * stand_scaler, f13 f9 cube * stand_scaler, f13 f10 cube * stand_scaler, f13 f14 square * stand_scaler, f5 cube f8 cube *, f7 cube f9 cube *, f8 cube f10 cube *, f9 cube f14 cube *, f10 f14 square *]
```

In this new feature set:
- Keep interactions between credit-related features like f13, which may indicate trends with employment and credit score.
- Utilize cube transformations to capture higher-order interactions and complex relationships.
- Apply standard scaling for normalized comparisons, which can be useful for models sensitive to feature scales.
- Integrate original and transformed features to boost model predictability by understanding their interactions.
- Introduce feature combinations with products, which can capture multiplicative interactions critical for predicting outcomes.

- Combine multiplicative interactions (f8 f10 *) to capture combined effects.
- Include logarithmic transformation on a key feature (f14 log) to handle large variations and potentially skewed distributions.
- Capture potential interactions with (f7 f13 +), considering both features together.
- Apply the logarithmic transformation on a primary demographic feature (f1 log).
- Use reciprocal transformations to understand feature impact reversals (f9 reciprocal).
- Combine nonlinear logistics on a key feature with log (f14 sigmoid log) for interaction modeling.
- Feature interaction with a cube transformation after standard scaling (f13 f1 + stand_scaler cube) to further add nonlinearities.

I'll combine transformations to capture various patterns and non-linear relationships.

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f2, f3, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 log, f13 sqrt, f14 sigmoid, f8 cube, f10 cube, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f7 log, f9 log, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f7 cos, f9 sqrt sqrt, (f8 * f14) minmax_scaler, (f3 + f8) stand_scaler, (f9 * f10) sigmoid, (f14 / f13) sigmoid]
```

**Explanation of Key Components:**
1. **Basic Statistical Enhancements**: Scaling methods such as `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` are applied to a wide range of features to normalize the data and extract standardized patterns.
2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Functions like `sqrt`, `log`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` add non-linearity which can capture complex interactions within the data.
3. **Combining Different Features**: Combining features such as `(f8 * f14)` and `(f3 + f8)` bring forth interactions between features that may be significant for predictions.
4. **Advanced Composite Expressions**: Using operations like `cos` and `sqrt sqrt` introduces further non-linearity and interaction effects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In the second example, there is a new feature, `f1 cube` added. Let's build on that and further enhance the feature set:

```

Here are the enhancements made:

- `f10 / f8`: A ratio feature to capture relationships between these features, which could provide insights into relative differences.
- `f9 sqrt`: Using square root transformation can help manage skewness in distribution.
- `f7 tanh`: Applying the hyperbolic tangent function to `f7` can help normalize feature values.
- `f1 cube f14 -`: Subtracting `f14` from the cube of `f1` can capture more nuanced interaction effects between these two features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:43:57,333 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, I will generate a new feature set attempting to improve the predictive power for the credit card application success prediction task, utilizing complex transformations to capture potential nonlinear relationships and interactions. I will choose transformations that provide dimensionality reduction and interaction enhancements, keeping in mind the numerical stability and potential interpretability improvements:

```
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f14 square, f13 f8 *, f13 f8 cube *, f13 f10 cube *, f4 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f5 cube quan_trans, f6 cube quan_trans, f7 cube quan_trans, f8 cube quan_trans, f9 cube quan_trans, f10 cube quan_trans, f14 square quan_trans, f13 f8 * quan_trans, f13 f9 * quan_trans, f13 f10 * quan_trans, f13 f8 cube * quan_trans, f13 f9 cube * quan_trans, f13 f10 cube * quan_trans, f13 f14 square * quan_trans, f13 f14 square * tanh, f7 sigmoid, f9 minmax_scaler sqrt, f13 f10 * stand_scaler]
```

In this expanded feature set, I added some complexity with transformations like `tanh` and `sigmoid` to capture non-linear patterns, and used `stand_scaler` to standardize some feature interactions for better convergence in many machine learning models. Additionally, I used `minmax_scaler` along with `sqrt` to adjust and compress the range of `f9` into a more favorable distribution for certain types of models.

[f1, f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f14 stand_scaler, f13 quan_trans, f2 cube, f5 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f14 stand_scaler cube, f13 quan_trans cube, f1 minmax_scaler cube, f14 square, f14 f5 -, f14 sqrt, f1 minmax_scaler cube cube, f7 cube cube, f8 cube cube, f9 cube cube, f10 cube cube, f13 cube cube, f14 f5 - cube, f14 square cube, f13 cube, f14 sqrt tanh, f1 cube, f10 / f8, f9 sqrt, f7 tanh, f1 cube f14 -, f8 f13 /, f1 f7 *, f10 f9 +, (f10 f8 /) tanh, f14 sqrt log, (f13 f5 +) sigmoid]
```

**Explanation of enhancements:**

1. **Enhanced Interactions**: Included combinations like `f8 f13 /` and `f1 f7 *` to explore interactions between YearsEmployed and Employment status, and Gender with Employment status.
   
2. **Advanced Composite Features**: Features like `(f10 f8 /) tanh` and `(f13 f5 +) sigmoid` utilize mathematical transformations to capture non-linear relationships which can be crucial for decision boundaries in classification tasks.

3. **Log and Sigmoid Transformation**: Adding `f14 sqrt log` and `(f13 f5 +) sigmoid` to incorporate non-linear scaling, which can help in normalizing skewed data or emphasizing higher-order interactions.

These enhancements focus on introducing potentially insightful transformations and interactions between the features, aiming to effectively capture nuances in the data that relate to credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:44:15,021 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, the latter feature set appears to be more refined because it excludes the `[f14 sqrt tanh]` term, which might be contributing extraneous complexity without evident necessity. To create a better feature set, we can further simplify and maintain useful transformations that contribute meaningful variance for prediction while omitting potential redundancy. Here's a suggested improved feature set:

2026-01-12 11:44:32,504 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by combining elements from the provided examples, let's consider operations that increase the complexity and potential separability of the features while maintaining a manageable level of complexity. This will involve selecting transformations that might capture non-linear relationships in the data, and using combination operations like multiplication which can enhance interaction effects between features. Here’s a new set incorporating concepts from your examples:

```
[f9, f10, f8 cube, f10 cube, f13 f8 * cube, f8 quan_trans cube, f10 cube quan_trans, f13 f8 cube * quan_trans cube, f8 cube quan_trans cube cube, f10 cube quan_trans cube cube, f13 f8 cube * cube cube, f14 square, f8 cube cube cube cube, f10 cube cube cube, f13 f8 cube * quan_trans cube cube, f13 f9 * quan_trans cube cube, f9 quan_trans cube square, f14 square cube, f13 f8 * quan_trans cube cube cube, f10 cube cube cube cube]
```

In this feature set:
- I included simple cubes and qua_trans transformed cubes for basic variance capture and potential non-linear relationships.
- Operations combining multiplication with cube transformations capture interaction effects between features that might not be linear.

- The complexity is increased compared to the previous sets by adding cube operations and multiplications to enhance interaction effects, but it remains focused on a few feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:44:38,132 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set based on the two provided examples, we aim to keep useful transformations (such as scaling, mathematical functions like sqrt, cube, etc.) while potentially introducing better diversity or complexity in features by adding new transformations and combinations that may capture underlying patterns more effectively. Here is a proposal for a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f8, f10, f14, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f14 sqrt, f8 cos, f10 cos, f8 sqrt cos, f10 sqrt cos, f7 cube cos, f8 cube cos, f9 cube cos, f10 cube cos, f8 sqrt cube cos, f9 sqrt cube cos, f10 sqrt cube cos, f14 minmax_scaler cos, f14 f13 - cos, f14 sqrt tanh cos, f8 f10 *, f14 log, f7 f13 +, f1 log, f9 reciprocal, f14 sigmoid log, f13 f1 + stand_scaler cube, f7 f8 + sqrt, f14 f9 - reciprocal, f10 f5 * log]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Existing Features Transformation:** Keep the consistent transformations (sqrt, cube, cos) from both provided examples as they have been identified as noteworthy.

2. **Mathematical Operations:** 
   - Retain important mathematical operations like multiplication (*) for combining features, as seen in `f8 f10 *`.

3. **Additional Transformations:**
   - Introduce new feature transformations to explore possibly hidden relationships:
     - `f7 f8 + sqrt`: Sum of two features followed by square root, to capture non-linear interactions.
     - `f14 f9 - reciprocal`: Difference followed by reciprocal for potential inverse relationship capture.
     - `f10 f5 * log`: Multiply two features and then apply log to reduce skew and possibly capture multiplicative effects better.

4. **Retaining Complexity:** Maintain some features with a higher degree of transformations like cube, cos or combinations of multiple transformations to cover a broad spectrum of potential patterns. 

Overall, the new set retains essential transformations seen in both examples and introduces some additional potentially useful interactions without exceeding manageable complexity.

Key improvements:

1. Introduced new transformations such as `sqrt sin` for feature `f2` and `minmax_scaler tanh` for feature `f8`. These transformations are used to potentially capture different interactions or non-linear effects between features.
2. Maintained depth of transformations by including cube transformations and advanced cube cube transformations as seen in previous examples.
3. Emphasized feature diversity by introducing distinct mathematical functions that may help capture historical trends or patterns more effectively.

This feature set aims to capture a wider array of potential interactions and transformations that might refine prediction capability for the credit card application success metric.

In this feature set:
- Added `f13 log sin` to capture non-linear interactions through logarithm and sine transformations.
- Added `f2 f14 * cube` to explore interactions between `f2` and `f14` by multiplying and cubing.
- Added `f5 f7 tanh *` to assess the combination of `f5` and `f7` using tanh and multiplication.
- Added `f8 f9 / log`, combining `f8` and `f9` using division followed by logarithm to capture potential multiplicative relationships.
- Added `f10 f13 sqrt *` to combine `f10` and `f13` using square root and multiplication for more nuanced pattern extraction.

In this feature set:

- Maintain important feature transformations like `f1 minmax_scaler`, `f14 stand_scaler`, and `f13 quan_trans` to capture scaling and distribution.
- Retain cubic transformations for complexity where needed, while adding interactions such as `f14 * f1` and `f2 / f7` to capture relational dynamics between features.
