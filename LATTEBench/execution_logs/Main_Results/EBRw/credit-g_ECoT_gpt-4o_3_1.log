```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f1 log, f0 sigmoid, f2 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, f18 sigmoid, f12 f3 *, f0 f12 f3 * -, f5 sigmoid f12 f3 * -, f12 f3 * cube, f0 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f0 sigmoid quan_trans, f2 sigmoid quan_trans, f9 sigmoid quan_trans, f0 cos, f3 cos, f9 cos, f19 cos, f12 f3 * reciprocal, f8 f9 + minmax_scaler, f11 f17 - stand_scaler]
```

Explanation:

1. Retained basic features `f0, f1, f2, f3, f5` for essential data.
2. Used log transformation `f1 log` for scale normalization.
3. Included several sigmoid transformations `f0 sigmoid`, `f2 sigmoid`, `f9 sigmoid`, `f18 sigmoid` for probability-like transformations.
4. Continued using the product `f12 f3 *` and included its transformed variants for interaction term exploitation.
5. Introduced more complex interactions like `f12 f3 * cube` to capture non-linear relationships.
6. Incorporated quantile transformations for `f0, f2, f5` to manage distribution skewness.
7. Added cosine transformation for `f0, f3, f9, f19` to exploit periodic behavior in some features.
8. Introduced reciprocal transformation `f12 f3 * reciprocal` to manage inverse relationships.
9. Combined features with addition and subtraction followed by scaling for feature normalization: `f8 f9 + minmax_scaler` and `f11 f17 - stand_scaler`.

This improved set uses a combination of basic feature retention, transformation, complex interactions, and scaling to extract richer information from the original dataset.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

1. Basic features (as-is):
   - `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, ..., `f19`

2. Transformations:
   - Using logarithm, logarithm of logarithm, and logarithm of tanh for scaling down the data and handling skewness in distribution:
     - `f7 log`
     - `f10 log`
     - `f15 log`
     - `f17 log`
     - `f1 log`
     - `f12 tanh`
     - `f1 log log`
     - `f12 tanh log`

Combining both feature sets by introducing new interactions and transformations:

[f0, f1 cos, f0 square, f0 square cos, f1 cos sigmoid, f0 square sigmoid, f0 cos sigmoid, f5 square cos sigmoid, f0 square sigmoid log, f0 cos sigmoid log, f5 square cos sigmoid log, f1 reciprocal, f1 cos square sigmoid log cos, f0 square sigmoid log cos, f0 square cos sigmoid cos, f0 cos sigmoid log cos, f1 cos square cos cos, f0 cos sigmoid cos, f1 cos cos, f0 square cos sigmoid log cos sigmoid, f1 cos square cos sigmoid log sigmoid, f1 cos square cos sigmoid cos sigmoid, f0 square sigmoid log cos sigmoid, f0 square cos sigmoid cos sigmoid, f0 cos sigmoid log cos sigmoid, f1 cos sigmoid log cos sigmoid, f1 cos square sigmoid log sigmoid, f1 cos square cos sigmoid sigmoid, f1 cos cos log cos sigmoid, f0 square sigmoid log sigmoid, f0 square sigmoid cos sigmoid, f0 square cos sigmoid sigmoid, f0 square cos cos sigmoid, f0 cos sigmoid cos sigmoid, f1 cos cos log sigmoid, f0 cos sigmoid sigmoid, f0 cos cos sigmoid, f1 cos cos sigmoid, f0 cos sigmoid log sin, f0 square cos sigmoid log sin, f0 square cos sigmoid log sin sin, f0 cos sigmoid log sin sin, f0 square cos sigmoid log sin cos]
```

This set maintains the complexity and depth by including a variety of transformations, capturing interactions among different features, using trigonometric and logarithmic transformations, and retaining interpretability by balancing the complexity of operations applied.

**Explanation:**
1. **Intensity and Diversity of Transformations**: The new feature set leverages a wide variety of mathematical transformations and combinations, utilizing arithmetic operations (+) and functions (cos, sin, stand_scaler) across different original features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f13`, etc.). The cosine and sine functions along with scaling are particularly useful to capture periodic and nonlinear patterns.
  
2. **Combinatory Richness**: This feature set includes heavier combinations of features and transformations, which may help in capturing interactions that are not captured individually. This richness is evident in expressions like `f1 stand_scaler stand_scaler f0 cos + f1 stand_scaler cos f0 cos + f2 f0 cos + + +` and others which involve stacked transformations.

3. **Focus on Key Features and Transformations**: The focus remains on certain key transformations and features that appeared consistently in the original examples provided, like `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f13`, blended with transformations such as stand_scaler, cos, and sin, which are common in feature engineering tasks to handle nonlinear relationships and normalization.

This new feature set, rich in complexity and diversity of transformations, is crafted to harness the maximum possible variance in the dataset, potentially leading to improved downstream task performance like credit prediction.

2026-01-12 10:46:51,846 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two recent feature sets provided, the task is to find a more refined feature set by synthesizing aspects of both.

The first set focuses primarily on using mathematical operations like `square` and non-linear transformations like `tanh`, and scaling, while the second set similarly emphasizes the use of powering features, with additional use of functions such as `tanh`.

A better feature set should leverage both square and non-linear transformations judiciously to capture complex interactions, while ensuring that it's not overly complex or excessive in feature generation, which could lead to overfitting. Given that both feature sets employ similar operations with different arrangements and repetition levels, an improved version will combine these to ensure maximal feature capture with reasonable complexity.

Here's a synthesized feature set drawing from each:
```plaintext
[f0 square square tanh, f0 f13 square tanh square, f2 square square tanh, f1 square square, f18 tanh square, f5 square square, f0 square tanh square, f2 square square square, f0 square square square tanh, f1 square square tanh, f13 square square tanh, f4 square tanh square, f0 f5 square minmax_scaler, f2 square square f11 square tanh, f0 f3 square tanh square, f10 square square tanh]
```

This feature set maintains the complexity by leveraging deep squared interactions and non-linear transformations like `tanh` to handle non-linear relationships, but it avoids over-repetitiveness to maintain generalizability and computational efficiency for the downstream credit prediction task.

### Explanation:
- I've retained transformations like `f4 f1 *` (credit_amount multiplied by duration) and `f12 sigmoid` (transformation on age), as these transformations are designed to uncover interactions and non-linearities.
- Added `f4 log` to reduce the skew of credit_amount and handle the wide range.
- Included `f5 reciprocal` to transform savings_status, which could highlight individuals with very low savings positively impacting the prediction.
- `f19 tanh` serves to center the foreign_worker feature to better identify patterns around the mid-range values.
- `f1 f5 / minmax_scaler` is added to highlight the ratio of duration over savings_status, scaled appropriately. This ratio could bring additional predictive power, particularly when scaled, as it reflects both long-term obligations and immediate savings situation.

2026-01-12 10:47:15,513 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, let's combine the useful transformations and additional feature interactions seen in the examples provided. We want to enhance the ability to capture complex patterns by possibly combining some features through basic arithmetic operations and applying transformations that might capture non-linear relationships.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 , f1 , f4 , f13 , f19 , 
f1 log , f17 log , f7 log , f10 log , f15 log , 
f12 tanh , f1 log log ,

f7 log f1 + , 
f2 f11 - f12 tanh + , 
f17 log f5 - sigmoid, 
f1 f2 * tanh , 
f5 f6 + f3 * log]
```

Explanation:

1. **Basic Transformations**: Retained `log` transformations from both examples as they can reduce skewness and handle wide-ranging numerical features.
   
2. **Feature Interactions**: Kept some interactions from the second example like `f1 f5 / f1 log +`, and added new interactions such as `f2 f11 - f12 tanh +`, which might capture complex relationships.

3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Utilized `tanh` to squeeze values and potentially stabilize variance in feature values while maintaining relationships.

This feature set focuses on leveraging rich transformations and interactions, aiming to capture both linear and non-linear patterns within the data. These derived features would need to be validated with modeling and feature importance analysis to ensure they contribute positively to the task of predicting credit approval.

- Used the combination of squares and cosine transforms to introduce non-linear periodic patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The goal is to enhance the current feature set by introducing non-linear transformations and combinations that might improve the model's ability to learn patterns.

Here's an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f0 tanh, f1 sin, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f12 sigmoid, f13 tanh, f14 tanh, f15 tanh, f16 tanh, f17 tanh, f18 tanh, f19 tanh, f12 sigmoid tanh, f1 sin tanh, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f13 minmax_scaler, f1 sin minmax_scaler, f6 tanh minmax_scaler, f8 tanh minmax_scaler, f14 tanh minmax_scaler, f0 log, f1 square, f4 sqrt, f7 * f14, f11 / (f12 + 1), f15 reciprocal, f6 tanh + f9, f3 minmax_scaler]
```

### Key Additions:
- **Logarithm (f0 log):** Log transformation can be useful for features with skewed distribution.
- **Square and Square Root (f1 square, f4 sqrt):** Captures non-linear effects that might be important.
- **Interaction Term (f7 * f14):** Creating interaction features can uncover hidden relationships between features.
- **Normalized Ratio (f11 / (f12 + 1)):** A ratio to capture relative differences, adding 1 to avoid division by zero.
- **Reciprocal (f15 reciprocal):** Useful for converting large values into smaller scales and exploring inverse relationships.
- **Combination (f6 tanh + f9):** Adds a linear combination of non-linear transformation and an original feature.
- **Normalized Feature (f3 minmax_scaler):** Min-Max scaling to normalize feature range, enhancing comparability in some cases.

These transformations leverage different mathematical operations to capture potential non-linear relationships and scale features into ranges more suitable for various model types, potentially improving predictive performance.

I've taken into account the use of different mathematical transformations and combinations to try and generate meaningful new features for your model:

```

In this feature set:
- I've employed logarithmic, tanh, sqrt, and sigmoid transformations to normalize or scale the features, which can be crucial for certain machine learning algorithms.
- I've utilized operations like division and multiplication to create interaction terms between features.
- Complex nested transformations like `f1 f2 cube tanh` aim to capture non-linear relationships.
- Combined features like `f14 minmax_scaler f3 log +` may help in feature scaling and normalization across different ranges.

This transformation approach can potentially highlight hidden patterns, improve non-linearity capture, and help in model interpretability.

2026-01-12 10:47:46,002 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set from the provided examples, we need to leverage a combination of techniques that capture complex patterns while ensuring the set remains manageable and not overly complex. We aim to balance feature transformation techniques and complexity to improve prediction tasks.

Here's a suggested feature set using a combination of techniques seen in both examples, optimized for potential predictive power:

```plaintext

```

### Key Transformations and Rationale:

1. **Core Features**: Start with a subset of original features (`f0`, `f1`, `f5`, `f15`), capturing essential information directly from the data.

2. **Standard Scaling**: Use `stand_scaler` for normalization to mean and variance (`f1`, `f11`, `f5`, `f15`) to handle scale differences.

3. **Quantile Transformation**: `quan_trans` is applied to some features (`f6`, `f14`) to make the distribution uniform, useful for non-Gaussian data.

4. **Combinatorial Operations**: Employ combinations (`+`, `*`, `/`, `-`) to capture interactions between features (`f0 f5 *`, `f1 f5 +`, etc.).

5. **Logarithmic Transform**: Apply `log` to reduce skewness in features like `f0`, `f5`, and `f15`.

6. **Cosine Transform**: Use `cos` on selected features to introduce non-linearity and potential cyclic patterns.

7. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Applied to decrease the influence of large values (`f0`, `f5`).

8. **Additional Transformations**: Include combinations like `stand_scaler log` and `quan_trans cos` on various features based on the type (e.g., skew in `f0`, `f14`).

This combined feature set is designed to capture various data characteristics and interactions, providing a richer basis for the prediction model.

Here's a proposed feature set, leveraging both the variance brought by transformations and the combinations of features:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,

This set takes advantage of various transformations like `log`, `tanh`, and `minmax_scaler`, which are beneficial for normalizing data and dealing with non-linear relationships. Additionally, it combines different features using arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to capture interactions between features. Furthermore, feature engineering operations such as `stand_scaler`, `square`, and `cube` are mixed in to explore feature variation and enhance model performance over potential non-linearities in the data.

2026-01-12 10:48:02,835 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! Based on the two feature sets you've provided, let's create a refined and enhanced feature set. We'll aim for more diverse transformations and combine various feature engineering techniques to derive potentially more informative features for your predictive model.

Here's the new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,

 f18 log stand_scaler, f17 sqrt cos, 
 f1 f2 f3 * + stand_scaler, f4 f6 f8 * + tanh]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Arithmetic Combinations:**
   - Retained some of the original combinations like `f0 f1 +` and `f4 f5 +` for basic interaction terms.

2. **Standard Scaling:**
   - Maintained scaling for several individual features to normalize them, aiding in dealing with different units and ranges.

3. **Non-linear Transformations:**
   - Applied a variety of non-linear transformations such as `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `reciprocal`, `log`, and `sigmoid`, to potentially capture non-linear patterns.

4. **Complex Combinations and Interactions:**
   - Introduced more complex feature interactions like `f11 f13 * sqrt` and `f7 f8 / square` to model possible multiplicative and division interactions.
   - Used chained transformations like `f18 log stand_scaler` to refine certain transformed features further.

5. **Diversity of Transformations:**
   - Tried to cover a range of mathematical operations to capture a wide variety of possible relationships and interactions within the data.

This approach retains flexibility and various transformations, aiming to provide more comprehensive insights that might be useful for improving prediction accuracy.

2026-01-12 10:48:13,402 - INFO - llm output = To create a better and potentially more informative feature set, it's useful to combine existing transformations and explore new ones to capture more complex relationships in the data. Here is a new feature set drawing inspiration from the two provided examples:

**Explanation:**

1. **Expansion and Transformation:** This set maintains useful feature transformations such as `square`, `cos`, `stand_scaler`, and `log` from the original examples, indicating feature importance or potential nonlinear relationships.

2. **Diverse Mathematical Operations:** Includes a mix of operations like `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and interactions (`f2 stand_scaler f1 *`, `f7 f0 /`) that may capture complex relationships between features.

3. **Combining Transformations:** Utilizes combinations of transformations such as `square cos`, which capture non-linearity better.

4. **Feature Interaction:** Introduces interaction terms to potentially enhance predictive power by capturing synergistic effects between features.

The new feature set aims to provide diversified transformations and interactions that may enhance the machine learning model's ability to capture underlying patterns in the data for making accurate predictions.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 10:48:33,931 - INFO - llm output = To construct a better feature set, let's take inspiration from the provided examples and apply a variety of transformations while considering the statistical properties of the features. Structured transformation of features helps in capturing non-linear relationships and interactions among them. Here's a balanced combination of basic transformations, interactions, and non-linear transformations:

1. **Initial Features**: These are direct transformations to explore primary relationships.
   - `f1 log`
   - `f2 tanh`
   - `f12 sqrt`

2. **Interaction Terms**: Capture potential interactions between features.
   - `f0 f1 +`
   - `f0 f4 -`
   - `f2 f3 *`

3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Capture non-linear relationships with features.
   - `f4 f5 sqrt /`
   - `f3 f10 square +`
   - `f7 reciprocal`

4. **Complex Transformations**: Combine multiple operations to derive intricate features.
   - `f1 f5 / f1 log +`
   - `f5 f9 tanh * sqrt`
   - `f0 f19 tanh *`

5. **Aggregated or Derived Features**: Integrations and derivations to reveal absolute or cumulative effects.
   - `f14 f19 / f3 +`

Here's the proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, 
 f1 log, f2 tanh, f12 sqrt, 
 f0 f1 +, f0 f4 -, f2 f3 *, 
 f4 f5 sqrt /, f3 f10 square +, f7 reciprocal, 
 f1 f5 / f1 log +, f5 f9 tanh * sqrt, f0 f19 tanh *, 
 f14 f19 / f3 +]
```

This feature set integrates a mixture of operations (logarithm, tanh, square root, reciprocal) with feature interaction terms and complex transformations. This would ideally help capture more nuanced patterns in the data, potentially improving the prediction quality for the task.

2026-01-12 10:49:09,647 - INFO - llm output = To devise a better feature set, we will focus on simplification and strategic generation of new features. The goal is to avoid excessive nesting while retaining the ability to capture potential non-linear relationships and interactions that are meaningful for improving prediction accuracy. Here's an attempt to create a refined feature set:

- Utilize square transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Incorporate cosine and other transformations but limit excessive nesting to maintain interpretability.
- Focus on features with potentially higher influence, such as credit amount, duration, and credit history.
- Consider adding interactions or scaled versions of combinations to capture relationships between features.

- We combine arithmetic operations and transformations to create interaction terms that might capture the combined effects of certain features more effectively.
- Log transformations are used for features that might be more informative in logarithmic scale.
- Newly engineered features such as `f1 f5 / f1 log +` and `f1 f4 * f13 f14 / +` are included to potentially enhance the model's predictive power.

2026-01-12 10:49:31,166 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set that leverages the transformations and combinations suggested in the examples, I'd focus on using a variety of transformations that could capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. I'll aim to include more advanced interactions and a broader range of transformation techniques to cover varied aspects of the feature space.

Here is a new proposed feature set:

```

```

This feature set aims to:

1. Incorporate standard and advanced transformations (such as log, tanh, sqrt).
2. Use scaling and normalization (stand_scaler) to bring original feature scales to a common range.
3. Capture possible interactions between features, which might be crucial for the downstream task.
4. Provide a mix of elementwise transformations (cube, sqrt, log) and elementwise interactions (addition, multiplication, division). 

This variety increases the chances of capturing complex patterns in the data, thereby potentially improving predictions.

Here's a breakdown of the improvements:

1. Retained useful arithmetic combinations from example 1 (`f0 f1 +`, `f4 f5 +`, `f1 f4 *`, `f2 f3 *`) for handling interactions.

2. Included additional stand_scaler operations for commonly used features like `f6`, `f13`, and `f17`, ensuring they are normalized, as in both examples.

3. Retained and expanded the use of trigonometric and hyperbolic operations, utilizing both `cos` and `tanh` for several scaled features to capture cyclical or saturation patterns.

4. Combined chained transformations (scaling followed by `cos` and `tanh`) for potential interaction or nonlinear effects across both examples.

By incorporating these elements, the new feature set aims to capture interactions, normalize features, and leverage nonlinear transformations, potentially improving prediction accuracy for the credit decision task.

- Added interactions such as `f0 f3 * f2 cube +`, `f1 f2 f3 * tanh`, and `f5 f6 f9 * + sqrt` to capture complex relationships between multiple features.
- Applied transformations like `tanh`, `cos`, `sqrt`, and `log` to enhance feature behavior, potentially helping in capturing variances and improving model predictions.
- Used scaling (`stand_scaler`) judiciously to normalize features which can stabilize and improve the convergence of many machine learning models.

- Applied non-linear transformations (`tanh` and `sqrt`) to help capture non-linear relationships, particularly on combinations of features (`f2 f3 *` and `f4 f5 +`).
- Created composite features that might encode more complex interactions, aiming at increasing variance without excessive dimensionality increase.

2026-01-12 10:50:01,443 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, the goal is to derive a better feature set that can improve the prediction task of determining whether a person receives credit. The latter provided feature set uses higher-order powers and combinations, notably focusing on certain features repeatedly, possibly indicating their importance. We'll build upon these while being mindful of computational feasibility and potential multicollinearity. Here's a refined feature set:

```
[f1, f4, f1 square, f0 square, f2 square, f5 square, f11 square, f13 square, f17 square, f0 square square, f1 square square, f2 square square, f4 cos square, f4 cos square square, f1 square square square, f18 square square square, f3 square square square, f17 square square square, f5 square square square, f4 cos square square square, f2 square square square, f13 square square square, f0 cos, f1 square square square square, f11 square square square square, f14 square square, f16 square square, f19 square square, f5 cos square, f18 cos square]
```

Explanation:
1. Retained and frequently used features such as `f1`, `f4`, and their transformations are preserved due to their apparent importance.
2. The usage of cosine transformations for some squared features is retained, considering non-linear relationships might be captured effectively.
3. Inclusion of squares and higher powers reflects the non-linear importance of these features.
4. Selected unique cosine and higher-order transformations not overly redundant, aiming for diversity and minimizing unnecessary higher powers.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

**Explanation**:
- I retained the original feature set transformation with fundamental arithmetic operations.
- I applied standard scaling to a subset of the original and combined features to normalize the data.
- For non-linear transformations, I used the `tanh` operation on selected features and combinations to introduce non-linearities.
- I included a few additional transformations: `log` to compress the range of values for a product of features, `sqrt` to reduce the magnitude of divisions, and `square` to enhance differences.
