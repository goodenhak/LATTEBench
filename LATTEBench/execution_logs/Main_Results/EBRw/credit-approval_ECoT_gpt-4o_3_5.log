you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:36:58,452 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set by leveraging the examples you provided, it's often beneficial to focus on transformations that bring out non-linear relationships, handle skewness, or reduce the impact of outliers. The second set you provided focuses heavily on trigonometric transformations, which might not be as useful given the nature of the features (many of which are binary or categorical). A better approach would be to combine the use of scaling techniques, trigonometric, and hyperbolic transformations, focusing more on the operations that have been known to be beneficial for the existing dataset. Here is a better feature set according to the style you provided:

```plaintext

```

- This feature set includes some basic transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, and `square` which are often useful for normalizing the distribution of numerical features.
- The `tanh` and `sigmoid` are used to standardize features to a specific range, which is particularly effective for binary and scaled numerical data.
- The `minmax_scaler` is applied to one of the features to further ensure all data is within a comparable range, which can improve the convergence of machine learning algorithms.

2026-01-12 11:37:11,332 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set by considering the given examples, we can focus on utilizing transformations that have shown to be effective in the examples. Below is a new feature set leveraging deeper transformations and a combination of different features to potentially capture more complex relationships in the data:

```

```

In this new feature set:
- The transformations such as `sigmoid` and `quan_trans` are applied multiple times to deepen their effect, which can help capture non-linear relationships.
- The inclusion of `tanh` transformations provides an additional layer of non-linearity, which might be beneficial in modeling complex patterns.
- `sqrt` and `log` transformations are applied at key combinations which might help normalize the data and reduce skewness.
- The use of `stand_scaler` ensures some features are centered around a mean, which can be useful for certain models like SVM or logistic regression.

Here's the enhanced feature set:

```plaintext
[f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f14 ,f1 f13 * ,f1 sigmoid ,f7 sin ,f8 sin ,f9 sin ,f10 sin ,f1 f0 + ,f1 f7 + ,f1 f10 + ,f14 cos ,f10 square ,f14 f1 + ,f1 f0 sin + ,f1 f10 sin + ,f14 sqrt ,f10 f14 * ,f14 cube ,f10 cube ,f7 f0 * ,f7 f1 * ,f14 log ,f13 tanh ,f13 sigmoid f9 / ,f10 f13 sin * ,f7 sin f10 cube +]
```

Key improvements here involve:

1. Incorporating interactions between selected features by multiplication (*), such as `f7 f0 *`, which introduces the interaction between employment and gender effects.
2. Use of logarithm (`log`) transformation on `f14` to mitigate skewness and highlight exponential relationships, which can be useful for income data.
3. Using `tanh` on `f13`, potentially stabilizing the influence from the driver's license feature.
4. Applying the division operation, such as `f13 sigmoid f9 /`, to explore the dependence of credit score relevance based on prior defaults.
5. Combining transformations (`f10 f13 sin *`) to capture more complex, nonlinear relationships.

This suggestion leverages established transformation techniques like `sin`, `log`, and interaction terms to build a robust feature set potentially leading to better predictive performance.

2026-01-12 11:37:32,121 - INFO - llm output = Creating meaningful transformed features is a key aspect of feature engineering, especially when dealing with complex datasets for classification tasks, such as predicting credit card application success. To build upon the provided examples and generate potentially useful transformed feature sets, the goal is to construct features that may reveal underlying patterns contributing to the target variable.

Here is a proposed transformation:

```
[f1 f8 f2 * -, f14 f1 reciprocal *, f8 f9 sqrt +, f10 f14 stand_scaler /, f7 f13 tanh -, f1 reciprocal reciprocal f14 +, f1 f8 f13 *, f9 f13 stand_scaler *, f11 f13 minmax_scaler +, f8 f14 reciprocal reciprocal *, f1 sigmoid reciprocal f13 *, f2 stand_scaler f13 *, f7 tanh f1 *, f14 f10 reciprocal +, f13 f13 / sqrt, f2 f9 cube -, f8 cube f1 f14 * +, f11 f9 reciprocal reciprocal *, f14 cube sqrt]
```

Rationale:
1. New interactions and transformations are applied to potentially uncover relationships and dependencies between features (e.g., income and debt).
2. Reciprocal transformations on credit score and other income-related figures help identify their inverse relations.
3. Feature transformations leveraging scaling (stand_scaler, minmax_scaler) normalize distributions aiding model learning.
4. Non-linear transformations (tanh, cube, sqrt) help capture complex, potentially non-linear relations which might be important for the predictive task.
5. Mixing original features with transformed values ensures a diverse set encouraging the model to capture underlying distributions effectively.

This enhanced feature set can lead to better model performance by revealing hidden patterns and relationships between predictors impacting credit card application success. Each transformation is crafted to either normalize, scale, or introduce non-linear aspects for broadening the model's learning scope.

```

Explanation of additions:
- I've kept the transformations that consistently appear in both feature sets and added them directly to maintain model stability and performance.
- Added `[f6 reciprocal]`: This transformation can be helpful for handling certain skewness in data, particularly if `f6` doesn't behave linearly.
- Added `[f14 stand_scaler]`: Standard scaling can be an effective normalization technique, especially for a feature like income that may have a wide range.
- Added `[f2 f7 *]`: Creating interaction features can capture complex relationships between the number of prior defaults and years employed, which may be indicative of credit card approval.
- Added `[f10 cube]`: Cubing a feature like credit score can emphasize deviations from the mean more strongly in cases of low or high scores, leading to better differentiation in prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here, transformations like `tanh`, `cos`, `sin`, `reciprocal`, and `cube` could bring out non-linear relationships or interactions between features that would be beneficial for the predictive model. Adjustments like using `sqrt` for some features can help compress the range and potentially enhance the model's performance, while scaling operations like `minmax_scaler` could help in normalizing the feature space.

```

**Explanations:**

1. **Basic Features**: Retaining the original features `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f4`, `f5`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, and `f14`, which might capture significant information individually.

2. **Trigonometric and Non-linear Transformations**: 
   - Applying `sin`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` transformations to capture periodic or saturating effects in features.
   - Using `tanh` and `sigmoid` specifically on likely-to-be bounded features to leverage their scaling properties.

3. **Interactions**: 
   - Creating interaction terms like `f0 f5 *`, `f1 f7 *`, and other similar combinations allows us to capture co-dependencies between features.
   - Using combinations like `f5 f14 reciprocal *` and `f2 f5 f14 * *` to explore how features together influence the outcome.

4. **Feature Rescaling**: 
   - Included `f4 minmax_scaler`, demonstrating normalization, helping in cases where scale matters, ensuring numerical stability and comparability.

This feature set aims to build on the interactions, transformations, and scaling to discern complex patterns in the data better.

2026-01-12 11:37:56,475 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformation examples and operations, we aim to create a better postfix feature set by considering the potential informative transformations that could improve prediction quality. The second example seems to explore the transformation of a single feature extensively but lacks interaction terms, while the first example focuses more on constructing interaction terms.

Here's a potentially improved postfix feature set combining elements from both examples:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f0 f1 * ,f1 reciprocal ,f1 sigmoid ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 tanh ,f14 f13 - ,f8 f5 + ,f14 f3 - f1 * ,f10 f2 + ,f14 f6 - f13 - ,f2 f13 - ,f3 f13 - stand_scaler ,f5 f0 / minmax_scaler]
```

**Rationale:**

1. **Basic Features**: Retained all original features for completeness.

2. **Interactions**:
   - Added interaction terms like `f0 f1 *` for possible compound effects between features.
   - Combined transformations and relations like `f8 f5 +`, `f14 f3 - f1 *` for examining meaningful composites.

3. **Varied Transformations**: 
   - Various transformations were applied such as `reciprocal`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh` to `f1`, for generating non-linear transformations.
   - Added standardized transformations, specifically `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`, to capture relative variations within compound terms.

These improvements aim to capture complex relationships and produce features with increased potential for enhancing predictive capability in the credit card application success model.

2026-01-12 11:38:00,704 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the two examples provided, we'll combine ideas and introduce transformations for improved representation:

Start with the original features: [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14]

Transformations:
- Apply transformation functions to the features to potentially capture more elaborate patterns:
  - Use `tanh` and `log` for non-linear transformations, especially on features like `Age`, `Debt`, `YearsEmployed`, `CreditScore`, and `Income` which could exhibit non-linear behaviors.
  - Utilize `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for normalization, enhancing feature comparability.
  - Implement trigonometric functions like `sin` on selected features to capture periodic patterns or cyclicity.

Here is the new feature set in postfix format:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f4 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f8 log ,f9 log ,f10 log ,f13 log ,f14 log ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f1 sin ,f2 sin ,f10 sin ,f11 sin ,f12 sin ,f0 f13 / ,f1 f14 +]
```

This set not only retains some transformations from previous examples but also includes additional transformations such as `tanh`, `log`, `stand_scaler`, and an arithmetic combination to enhance prediction accuracy.

2026-01-12 11:38:17,533 - INFO - llm output = To leverage the transformations and operations given in the two feature sets examples, we'll aim to create a new feature set that optimizes feature engineering for the prediction task, incorporating more complex transformations and combining various operations to potentially reveal more informative interactions:

1. Begin with a focus on key features such as employment status (`f4` Employed), prior defaults (`f8` PriorDefault), and income (`f14` Income), given their potential direct impact on credit card application success.

2. Use a series of transformations to explore interactions between features and create new compound features. Opt for operations that can reveal nonlinear relationships and interactions, such as `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cube`.

Here's a proposed transformed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f4, f8, f14, f4 tanh, f8 sigmoid, f14 log, f0 f8 *, f4 f14 *, f8 f14 *, f1 f8 *, f0 f14 /, f4 f8 tanh *, f8 f14 tanh *, f0 f4 tanh /, f8 f14 tanh /, f14 cube, f0 tanh f4 *, f8 tanh f14 /, f0 f8 f14 * /, f4 tanh f14 cube /]
```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features:** Directly use key numerical features which may have a direct relationship with the credit card application success.
  
- **Non-linear Transformations:** Apply `tanh` and `sigmoid` to explore non-linear relationships that may not be captured by original features.
  
- **Interactions:** Create interactions between features (`f0 f8 *`, `f4 f14 *`) to reveal potential synergies or dependencies.
  
- **Compound Operations:** Use combinations of operations like `tan` and `/` to refine understanding of relationships, add complexity, potentially revealing more nuanced interactions.
  
- **Higher Order Complexity:** Incorporate transformations like `cube` for `f14` to capture intricate patterns in income data.

This transformed feature set seeks to enhance the predictive capacity of the model by capturing both linear and complex nonlinear relationships among features that are significant for determining success in credit card applications.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:38:33,659 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set, we'll further transform and combine features using a mix of mathematical operations and scaling techniques. Here’s a new feature set built upon the previous examples:

[f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f5 , f6 , f7 , f8 , f9 , f10 , f11 , f12 , f13 , f14 , f0 sqrt , f1 log , f2 log , f3 log , f5 square , f4 sigmoid , f6 tanh , f7 reciprocal , f8 tanh , f9 cube , f10 sqrt , f11 sin , f12 tanh , f13 stand_scaler , f14 minmax_scaler , f0 tanh , f1 sigmoid , f0 f1 * , f2 f5 / , f6 f8 + , f9 f3 - , f10 f11 + , f12 f14 * , f0 tanh f6 + , f13 f14 / , f1 square]

In this set, I've:

- Added a few interactions among features to capture potential relationships (e.g., f0 f1 *, which multiplies Gender and Age).
- Included some subtraction and addition of transformed features to capture more complex relationships that might help in prediction (e.g., f9 f3 -, which subtracts log-transformed Married from cube-transformed Employed).
- Continued to use the transformations and scalings that seemed useful: sqrt, log, square, sigmoid, tanh, reciprocal, cube, stand_scaler, and minmax_scaler.
- Added a new square transformation to f1 (Age), exploring its quadratic effect. 

This approach attempts to explore more nuanced feature-engineered interactions that might be predictive of credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:38:40,311 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set considering the given two examples, I'm aiming for a combination that may capture complex relationships while being manageable for computation and interpretation in predictive modeling.

Here is a proposed feature set combining transformations from your two examples:

```
[f1 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f4 sin, f5 sin, f7 sin, f8 sin, f10 sin, f6 cube tanh, f12 tanh, f13 cube square sin, f1 log sqrt, f1 sigmoid sqrt, f1 reciprocal log, f1 stand_scaler, f13 minmax_scaler]
```

Explanation:
- Basic transformations (cube, sin) are maintained for capturing non-linearity.
- Implemented `tanh` as it helps map large ranges of values to a smaller range while preserving differences between them.
- Combined `log` transformation in different ways for `f1` to explore alternative distributions and interactions.
- Included both `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for `f1` and `f13` for normalization.
- These transformations could improve model performance by extracting new informative patterns from original features.

**Explanation:**
- Used `minmax_scaler` on `f0` for scaling, improving numerical stability.
- Applied `tanh` on `f1`, `f6`, `f9`, and `f11` to normalize and potentially highlight differences.
- Transformed `f2` using `log` for compression and feature differentiation.
- Applied square root transformations (`f3 sqrt`, `f10 sqrt`, `f12 sqrt`) to reduce skewness.
- Used `square` on `f5` and `cube` on `f13` to enhance non-linearity.
- Implemented `sigmoid` on `f7` for normalization in a bounded range.
- Transformed `f8` using `reciprocal` for inverse transformation.
- Applied `stand_scaler` on `f14` to standardize the features.
- Combined transformation `f0*sin*f1+f2` to create a non-linear interaction feature potentially capturing complex relationships.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 11:38:57,570 - INFO - llm output = To derive a new feature set from the given examples, we will analyze the transformations present in both sets and then propose an improved set using similar operations but with potentially more impactful combinations.

**Transformation Example 1:**
- Basic features: [f0, f1, f2, ..., f14]
- Transformations applied:
  - f0 sqrt, f1 log, f2 log, f3 log (transforms aimed at stabilizing variance or highlighting non-linear patterns)
  - f5 square (enhancing high values impact)
  - f4 sigmoid (bounded transformation)
  - f6 tanh and f8 tanh (often used to map values to [-1, 1])
  - f7 reciprocal (non-linear transformation)
  - f9 cube (intensifies larger values)
  - f10 sqrt (variance stabilization)
  - f11 sin and f12 tanh (cyclic or bounded mappings)
  - Scaling and normalization techniques: f13 stand_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler
  - f0 tanh, f1 sigmoid (additional bounded transformations)

**Transformation Example 2:**
- Focuses on combining and cosine transformations:
  - Basic features: [f1, f2, f5, ..., f14]
  - Emphasis on cosine: f[any] cos (highlighting cyclic behavior or phase shifts)
  - f13 sigmoid reciprocal (combination of transformations to capture bounded scaled behavior)
  - Interactions: f1 * f13, f2 - f13 (combining features)
  - Additional transformations: f14 tanh (bounded mapping for stability)

**Improved Feature Set Proposal:**
1. Aim to enhance interaction combinations and transformations that capture non-linear relationships:
```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 , f0 sqrt , f1 log , f2 * f13 , f2 log , f3 log , f5 square , f4 sigmoid , f6 tanh , f7 reciprocal , f8 tanh , f9 cube , f10 sqrt , f11 sin , f12 tanh , f13 stand_scaler , f14 minmax_scaler , f0 tanh , f1 sigmoid , f1 * f4 , f3 + f5 tanh , f6 * f8 cos , f10 square , f12 sigmoid reciprocal]
```

**Explanation:**
- Use transformations that stabilize variance or emphasize different regimes, like `f0 sqrt`, `f1 log`.
- Introduce feature interactions to capture dependencies among the features, e.g., `f2 * f13`, `f1 * f4`, `f3 + f5 tanh`.
- Utilize bounded transformations (`sigmoid`, `tanh`, `cos`) to control feature scaling and remain within meaningful boundaries.
- Apply powerful transformations with emphasis on cyclical patterns (`cos`, `sin`), interactions (`*`, `+`), and scaling (`square`, `cube`) where relevant for feature enrichment.
- Leverage combinations of transformations like `f12 sigmoid reciprocal` to explore complex relationships and enhance model predictive power.

The chosen transformations aim to balance variance stabilization, non-linear interactions, bounded mappings, and capture cyclic behaviors which can be helpful for understanding complex datasets in credit card applications.

Key steps in the creation:
1. **Interactive Transformations**: Operations combining features such as addition, multiplication, division, or square root offer interactions that help capture multiplicative or combinatorial relationships between features that may be key indicators of credit card application success.

2. **Vary Transformations**: Utilizing diverse transformations like `cos`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `stand_scaler` provides different perspectives or scales on the features, potentially improving model robustness to varying trends in the data.

3. **Explore Non-linearities**: Including features transformed by `cube`, `reciprocal`, and `sqrt` transformations addresses potential non-linear relationships that linearly transformed features might not capture effectively.

4. **Feature Selection**: Both original and transformed features are included to maintain the originality and add complexity, ensuring that essential information isn't lost due to excessive transformations.

These transformations aim to lever the behaviors and interactions of the original features better while exploring non-linear patterns in the data to enhance predictive power.

2026-01-12 11:39:06,634 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, the emphasis seems to be on creating transformed features through mathematical operations, which can potentially capture more complex relationships in the data. The goal is to generate more informative features that may improve predictive performance.

For crafting a new feature set, let's focus on balancing computational complexity with potential feature importance, while leaning towards transformations that may more effectively capture variance or interaction effects in the data.

Here's a new proposed feature set:

[f1, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f0 f5 +, f1 f6 *, f2 f6 *, f3 f6 *, f4 f5 *, f1 f7 /, f1 f8 /, f9 f13 /, f10 f13 /, f1 log, f5 log, f6 log, f7 log, f13 log, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f13 minmax_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f1 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f10 cube, f13 cube, f14 cube]

Explanation:

- Incorporate arithmetic combinations between different features to capture interaction effects.
- Use logarithmic and cube transformations, which can help in normalizing distributions and emphasizing differences in large values.
- Include features scaled through min-max scaling to bring values into a consistent range, helping algorithms like SVM and neural networks perform better.
- Utilize original features alongside transformed ones to ensure complexity doesn't overshadow raw informative value.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation for new additions:
- `f0 f1 *`: Multiplying gender and age might capture demographic trends.
- `f2 f3 *`: Interaction between debt and married status could reveal financial stability aspects.
- `f1 sqrt`: The square root transformation on age could capture non-linear effects in relation to credit card application success.
- `f2 log`: Log transformation on debt might help with outliers and emphasize differences in debt levels.
- `f5 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling on industry might aid in normalizing categorical effects.

Explanation:
- f1 reciprocal and f13 stand_scaler are retained from previous examples for their ability to scale and normalize data.
- f7 sqrt captures non-linear relationships from 'YearsEmployed'.
- f9 square emphasizes feature 'Employed', potentially highlighting the impacts of employment status.
- f14 log transformation is used to normalize 'Income', which can have a skewed distribution.
- f7 cube adds another layer of non-linear manipulation for 'YearsEmployed'.
- f2 * f14 interaction between 'Age' and 'Income' can reveal unique patterns that are important for credit approval.
- f3 + f4 interaction captures the combined status of 'Married' and 'BankCustomer', which are often key indicators in finance-related applications. 

These transformations and interactions are designed to extract more meaningful information from the original features and enhance the predictive power of the model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:39:28,787 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two examples provided, I would recommend focusing on transformations that could potentially provide more meaningful derived features. In particular, exploring interactions between features and transformations that normalize or scale them might be useful. Additionally, consider applying operations that could emphasize crucial patterns in the data.

Here's an improved feature set using the same postfix expression format:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f0 sin, f1 sin, f2 sin, f3 cos, f4 sin, f5 sin, f6 sin, f7 sin, f8 tanh, f9 sin, f10 sin, f11 sin, f12 sqrt, f2 cos, f4 sqrt, f14 log, f7 cube]
```

In this set:
- Using `tanh` on `f8` could help in compressing large ranges, which is often useful for neural networks.
- Using `sqrt` and `cube` operations on various features might reveal interactions that are not linear.
- Applying `log` on income (`f14`) can be particularly useful if the feature has a multiplicative relationship with the target.
- Exploring trigonometric functions such as `cos` and `sin` might highlight cyclic patterns if any exist.
  
This transformation aims to enhance the expressiveness of the feature space and potentially improve model performance in predicting credit card application success.

**Explanation:**
- **Trigonometric transformations** (cos, sin) applied to all original numerical features (f0 to f12) to capture periodic patterns or cyclical relationships.
- **Multiplication of f1 and f9** (Gender and PriorDefault) helps in identifying if the interaction between gender and history of default matters in credit card application success.
- **Subtraction of f2 and f8** (Age and Employed) can highlight differences in employment status relative to age.
- **Division of f3 and f7** (Debt and YearsEmployed) provides insight into how employment years mitigate debt.
- **Tanh transformation on Income** for handling extreme income values smoothly.
- **Addition of f1 and f2** (Gender and Age) could capture joint demographic interactions.
- **Square root transformation of f5** (Industry) might help when dealing with distinct categorical representation.
- **Sigmoid transformation on ZipCode** to handle spatial distribution and potential spatial non-linearities.
- **Square transformation of Gender** (f0 to emphasize distinctions between the gender categories).

We take inspiration from the latter example as it is deemed better and will attempt to further enhance it:

- Consider incorporating transformation techniques such as scaling or encoding that help improve the distribution or representation of features.
- Implement interactions or combinations between different features that are potentially synergistic.

2026-01-12 11:40:07,978 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, I will focus on creating features that enhance variability and potential predictive power. These might include transforming features to capture non-linear relationships or interactions, as well as using scaling and encoding methods to normalize feature distributions or reveal hidden patterns.

Here's a new feature set using the given transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f1 reciprocal ,f1 sigmoid ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 stand_scaler ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f13 tanh ,f13 minmax_scaler reciprocal ,f13 tanh reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal stand_scaler ,f13 sin]
```

Key Additions:
- Used `sin` on `f13`, which might capture cyclical patterns in the ZipCode feature.
- Applied `stand_scaler` and `sigmoid` to `f1`, enhancing the probability-like interpretations and normalization.
- Combined various transformations on `f13` (ZipCode) to see if spatial distributions have distinct predictive quality.

These transformations increase the diversity in representation of the original features, which may help a model capture complex relationships in the data and improve its prediction accuracy for credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

I'll use operations that enable scaling, non-linear transformation, and interaction effects. Here's a new feature set:



```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, 
 f0 sin, f1 sin, f2 sin, f3 sin, f4 sin, f5 sin, f6 sin, f7 sin, f8 sin, f9 sin,

 f13 sigmoid, 
 f13 sigmoid reciprocal,

 f14 log, 
 f12 sqrt, 
 f11 tanh, 
 f2 f14 /, 
 f1 f13 *, 
 f5 f11 *, 
 f14 f2 /]
```

This feature set combines standard scalar transformations, periodic functions that capture cyclic patterns, and interaction terms that could uncover dependencies between different features. The inclusion of various statistical transformations like `sigmoid`, `minmax_scaler`, and `tanh` adds robustness to capture the variability and potential skewed distributions in the data features. Interaction features like `f1 f13 *` and `f5 f11 *` can help identify important combined effects.

2026-01-12 11:40:24,370 - INFO - llm output = To improve the predictive performance of the model by better feature representation, let's integrate the insights from both feature expressions given and propose a new set of transformed features. This new expression aims to provide more meaningful attributes through advanced transformations and by leveraging interactions between features.

Below is a new feature expression using postfix notation and considering transformations from the previous sets:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f0 square ,f1 reciprocal ,f3 square ,f5 cos ,f6 tanh ,f7 sqrt ,f8 tanh ,f9 log ,f10 sin ,f11 stand_scaler ,f12 cube ,f13 sigmoid ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f0 f6 * ,f1 f7 + ,f2 f5 - ,f3 f9 *,f4 f10 + ,f11 f8 tanh ,f13 f14 / ]
```

Explanation:

- The integration of mathematical operations aims to encapsulate non-linear interactions and normalization, enhancing the model's ability to discern patterns.
- Squaring features such as `f0` and `f3` amplifies differences where variance is substantial.
- Reciprocal (`f1`) and logarithmic transformations (`f9`) help in handling skewed distributions.
- Trigonometric functions (`cos`, `sin`, `tanh`) capture cyclic or periodic relationships within the data.
- `f13`, representing standardized scaling applied twice using sigmoid, helps in constraining uneven scales from affecting outcomes.
- The interactions like `f0 f6 *` capture feature relationships that might indicate correlated success factors in credit card applications.
- Inclusion of the scaled feature (`f14`) aims to maintain the integrity of larger feature values within a normalized window.

These transformations collectively aim to discover more hidden structures within the data that could lead to improved predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:40:37,139 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets provided, the goal is to create a new feature set that combines and enhances the predictive power based on the transformations applied. 

When constructing a better feature set from examples, it's useful to:

1. **Utilize Scaling and Normalization**: These techniques help ensure that features are on a similar scale, which aids model convergence and performance.
2. **Incorporate Non-linear Transformations**: Functions like `sin`, `cos`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh` can help capture complex patterns and relationships.
3. **Selectively Apply Statistical Functions**: Using operations like `sqrt`, `log`, and reciprocal can address specific distributional skewness and improve feature interpretability.
4. **Combine Features**: By forming feature interactions (e.g., multiplication, division), you can capture relationships between features.

With these considerations, here's a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 stand_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f14 log, f0 sin, f1 sin, f2 sin, f3 sin, f4 sin, f5 sin, f6 sin, f7 sin, f8 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f11 sin, f12 sin, f13 sigmoid, f13 sigmoid reciprocal, f14 stand_scaler sin, f3 f13 *, f11 sqrt f2 /, f0 f1 *, f5 f12 sqrt *, f10 f13 reciprocal /, f3 f8 tanh *]
```

### Explanation:
- **Standard Scaling and Min-Max Scaling** on `f14` (Income) provide two useful versions for modeling.
- **Log Transformation** on `f14` helps manage any skew in income data.
- **Trigonometric Functions** (`sin`, `cos`) and **Sigmoid Function** on various features provide nonlinear representations.
- **Reciprocal and Square Root** applied within interactions to capture subtleties in data pairing.
- **Feature Interactions**: Multiplicative and divisional combinations to capture compound effects between features. 

This enhanced feature set focuses on feature transformation, scaling, and meaningful feature interactions, potentially improving model performance for predicting successful credit card applications.

2026-01-12 11:40:42,858 - INFO - llm output = To improve feature engineering for better credit card application prediction, I recommend leveraging transformations that incorporate meaningful interactions between existing features while ensuring numerical stability. Here, taking inspiration from both provided sets, a new feature set could be designed to capture these aspects effectively:

```plaintext
[f2 square f8 reciprocal f14 + tanh, f2 square f9 reciprocal f14 + tanh, f2 square f10 reciprocal f14 + tanh, f2 square f5 reciprocal f14 + sigmoid tanh, f2 square f8 reciprocal tanh sigmoid, f2 square f8 reciprocal f14 + tanh sigmoid, f2 square f10 reciprocal f14 + tanh sigmoid, f2 square f12 reciprocal f14 + tanh sigmoid, f2 square f10 reciprocal f14 + tanh sigmoid sigmoid]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Reciprocal Feature Interaction**: Using reciprocal interactions with `f14` (Income), multiplied with squared variations of features capturing debt, credit score, and other relevant predictors enhances understanding of the relative impact on financial status.

2. **Tanh and Sigmoid Transformations**: Applying the `tanh` and `sigmoid` transformations helps manage extreme values (due to scaled features like debt and credit score) and ensures predictive stability by compressing outputs to manageable ranges, which can be critical in a logistic context like credit card approval prediction.

3. **Combining Multiple Interactions and Transformations**: This strategy aims to uncover non-linear relationships and dependencies that could be indicative of a successful credit card application, especially when interacting features naturally align with the dimensions affecting creditworthiness.

By synthesizing both the multiplicative and additive properties of these interactions with thoughtful transformations, we optimize the feature set for predictive performance.
