The goal is to capture different aspects of the data distribution and relationships between the features, while ensuring that transformations like `log` and `reciprocal` are applied to features that have been pre-processed (e.g., via `sqrt` or `minmax_scaler`) to avoid undefined operations (e.g., `log` or `reciprocal` on non-positive values).

2026-01-13 11:41:20,040 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, we're looking to create more informative or transformed features. The goal is to achieve better representation and potentially improved predictions. Here is a new feature set derived from the examples, incorporating advanced transformations:

- `[f4 , f4 sqrt sigmoid , f4 sqrt sigmoid log , f4 sqrt sigmoid log quan_trans , f4 f4 * , f4 sqrt sigmoid quan_trans , f4 sqrt sigmoid log quan_trans quan_trans , f4 f4 cube , f4 stand_scaler , f4 minmax_scaler , f4 quan_trans]`

Explanation:
1. **f4**: The original feature representing counts for son's occupation — essential for targeting tasks.
   
2. **f4 sqrt sigmoid**: This transformation combines a square root and a sigmoid function, which can help manage large values and provide a non-linear transformation suitable for machine learning models.
   
3. **f4 sqrt sigmoid log**: Adding a logarithm after the previous transformation, which can manage skewness and spread out the data more evenly.

4. **f4 sqrt sigmoid log quan_trans**: Incorporates the quantile transformation, which can make the data distribution approximately follow a Gaussian distribution — helpful for models sensitive to feature scaling.

5. **f4 f4 ***: This captures interactions and unmet non-linear relationships between a feature and itself.

6. **f4 sqrt sigmoid quan_trans**: By quantile-transforming the previously sigmoid-transformed data, we refine the feature scale even further.

7. **f4 sqrt sigmoid log quan_trans quan_trans**: An additional quantile transformation often stabilizes variance and improves the robustness of feature scaling.

8. **f4 f4 cube**: Cubing the feature can capture even more complex nonlinear relationships and distinguish effects not visible in simpler transformations.

9. **f4 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling (zero mean, unit variance) is generally helpful for algorithms that assume data is centered around zero and can handle various ranges.

10. **f4 minmax_scaler**: Transforming data to a specified range (typically 0 to 1) can be particularly useful in algorithms sensitive to input scales like neural networks.

11. **f4 quan_trans**: Using quantile transformation alone allows handling outliers and obtaining a more uniform feature distribution useful for many learning models.

This set reflects a mix of traditional standardization techniques and non-linear transformations, ensuring both fundamental and advanced data preparation methods that could provide a more informative feature set for modeling.

Here’s a feature set proposal based on the given examples:

```plaintext

```

In this transformation:

- I included combinations of basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on different features to explore linear and non-linear interactions.
- I split some of the squared feature transformations into square roots for diversity.
- Applied both `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to specific feature transformations to ensure a standard range or distribution, which might help in cases of high variance.
- Kept `tanh` and integrated it with other mathematical operations to emphasize non-linearity.

This blend of transformations aims to capture more nuanced relationships between features that might help in predicting the binary outcome.

Combining these approaches, we can generate a new feature set focusing on both scaling and interaction terms:

```plaintext

- Input features `f3` and `f4`, as they relate to the target variable.
- Use of min-max scaling on key features, similar to the first example, to normalize these features.
- Square root transformation of select features for variance reduction and distribution normalization.
- Incorporation of addition and multiplication to generate interaction terms, inspired by the second example.

Given the structures presented in both examples, a better feature set can be created by focusing on combinations that emphasize normalization, non-linear transformations, and mathematical operations that capture relationships between features. Here's a proposed feature set based on the two examples:

```
[f4, f4 tanh, f4 f4 tanh -, f4 f4 f1 square * -, f4 quan_trans, f4 f4 tanh - quan_trans, f4 f4 f1 square * - quan_trans, f4 f4 tanh - quan_trans f3 tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + *, f4 f4 f1 square * - quan_trans f3 square tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + *, f4 tanh f3 tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + * tanh, f4 f3 f1 square * + log, f4 tanh f3 square tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + * sigmoid]
```

In this updated feature set: 
1. The last few transformations from each original set have been combined for intricate pattern capture through non-linear transformations and scalings (stand_scaler, sigmoid).
2. A log transformation has been added to emphasize diminishing returns on effects once values surpass a certain threshold, useful for skewed data.
3. A sigmoid transformation has been added to map variables to a range between 0 and 1 for normalized interpretability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:41:56,857 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the examples provided, the goal is to utilize transformations and combinations of features that may capture more complex relationships and improve predictive performance.

Let's analyze the previous feature sets:

1. The first feature set primarily relies on squaring features and applying the tanh transformation to emphasize non-linearity.

2. The second feature set includes more varied transformations like addition, subtraction, square root, multiplication, tanh, reciprocal, and also some scalers.

For the improved feature set, consider the following transformations and combinations that balance complexity and capture potential relationships well:

``` 
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f4 reciprocal, f1 f3 + cube, f2 f4 -, f3 f4 * tanh, f1 f2 /, f3 square minmax_scaler, f1 f4 + log]
```

Explanation:
- Basic transformations: `f1 sqrt`, `f2 sqrt`, and `f4 reciprocal` help capture non-linear trends and relationships.
- Feature combinations: `f1 f3 + cube` gives non-linear synergy between occupations and family structure, and `f2 f4 -` may capture interactions between father’s occupation and race.
- Interaction capturing: `f3 f4 * tanh` involves multiplication with a non-linear activator.
- Ratio: The ratio `f1 f2 /` can possibly highlight conditional dependencies between the father's and the son's occupation categories.
- Normalization and scaling: `f3 square minmax_scaler` maintains the scale between occupations and the `f1 f4 + log` transformation may emphasize significant associations in complex scenarios due to logarithmic nature.

Let's consider combining various transformations to enhance the new feature set.

Given the examples:

Example 1 (Postfix Expression):
```
[f4, f4 tanh, f4 f4 tanh -, f4 f4 f1 square * -, f4 quan_trans, f4 f4 tanh - quan_trans, f4 f4 f1 square * - quan_trans, f4 f4 tanh - quan_trans f3 tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + *, f4 f4 f1 square * - quan_trans f3 square tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + *, f4 tanh f3 tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + * tanh, f4 tanh f3 square tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + * stand_scaler, f4 f4 tanh - quan_trans f3 tanh f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + * stand_scaler]
```

Example 2 (Postfix Expression):
```
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f2 square tanh, f3 square tanh]

```

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:42:19,835 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions based on feature engineering using postfix expression operations, we need to carefully create a feature set combining the techniques demonstrated in the examples. We will strive to incorporate complex transformations that can capture essential patterns. Based on the feature sets provided, here is a better new feature set:

```
[f4 ,f4 tanh ,f4 f1 square * stand_scaler ,f3 square f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + ,f3 tanh f4 tanh f1 square * stand_scaler + ,f2 tanh f4 tanh f1 square * stand_scaler + ,f3 square tanh f4 tanh f1 square * stand_scaler + ,f4 f1 square * f4 f1 square * stand_scaler + ,f4 f3 tanh - ,f4 f3 f1 square * tanh -]

The improvements made include: 

1. Combining `tanh` transformations on multiple feature terms to potentially capture non-linear relationships.
2. Using `square` transformations and addition across multiple features for potentially capturing deeper interactions.
3. Considering both addition and subtraction operations to diversify relationships captured.
4. Distributing `tanh` transformation across differences of feature combinations aiming for capturing complex non-linear patterns.

The latter feature set example demonstrates a deeper transformation with the use of multiple sine transformations.

Here's a new feature set that builds upon those transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f4 sin ,f0 sin ,f1 sin ,f2 sin ,f3 sin ,f4 sin sin ,f4 tanh ,f4 log ,f4 reciprocal]
```

Explanation:
- The transformation includes the original features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`) for baseline modeling.
- It carries forward the sine transformations showing a deeper, potentially nonlinear relationship.
- `f4 tanh` is included from the earlier example to explore saturation effects.
- `f4 log` applies a logarithmic transformation which is useful in handling skewed data distributions.
- `f4 reciprocal` could capture inverse relationships, potentially adding value for features with high variance.

In constructing features like these, it's key to consider the statistical properties of the original and transformed features. Transformation can help in leading to a better separation between classes in the problem space.

1. Basic transformations like `tanh`, `square`, and `cube` to introduce non-linearity.
2. Combined features using operations like `+`, `*`, and `-` to capture interactions between features.
3. Standard scaling (`stand_scaler`) and normalization techniques (`minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans`) to bring the features into a similar range and reduce the effect of outliers, enhancing model convergence.
4. Advanced compound features that involve multiple transformations in sequence, to capture complex patterns present in the data. 

This approach aims to enhance the model's ability to discern patterns related to the target classification (positive 'P' or negative 'N') from transformed input features.

```

Explanation:

1. Maintain useful transformations such as `f4 tanh`, `f4 f1 square * stand_scaler`, which can capture non-linear relationships and scale features.

2. Include interactions and transformations: Combining square transformations, tanh, and stand_scaler is useful for capturing complex relationships.

3. Add stand_scaler to `f1` and a combination of `f2 sqrt` and `f1 sqrt *` for more insights into scaling and squaring.

This set combines complex interactions with straightforward scaling, aiming to capture relevant patterns while controlling model complexity.

```

```

Explanation:

1. **f0 sin**: Using the sine transformation on `f0` to capture periodic trends or relationships, if any.

2. **f1 minmax_scaler**: Scaling `f1` can be essential if the range of values varies greatly; min-max scaling normalizes the data to a 0-1 range.

3. **f2 log**: Applying logarithmic transformation on `f2` to potentially handle skewness or large value differences.

4. **f3 tanh**: The hyperbolic tangent transformation on `f3` can help centralize values, especially if they need to be centered around zero.

5. **f4 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling of `f4` creates features with zero mean and unit variance, often helping with model convergence and interpretability.

These transformations aim to capture interactions and the scaling required to improve prediction accuracy potentially.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:43:30,166 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, the goal is to transform original features into a new set that might improve prediction performance for the downstream task. The suggested features apply transformations that normalize, create nonlinear relationships, or emphasize certain aspects of the data to capture patterns more effectively.

Here is a new feature set that combines the strengths of previous examples and adds more transformation diversity:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4 minmax_scaler, f4 sqrt stand_scaler]

Explanation:

1. **f0, f1, f2, f3** - Keeping the original features, as they may have direct impact on prediction performance due to their categorical nature.

2. **f4 minmax_scaler** - Normalizing the numerical target feature helps to stabilize the variance and deal with different scales, potentially improving model sensitivity towards "counts_for_sons_first_occupation".

3. **f4 sqrt stand_scaler** - Applying the square root transformation helps in reducing skew in a potentially heavy-tailed distribution. Afterwards, standard scaling ensures the data is centered and scaled, making it more suitable for various machine learning algorithms.

This combination aims to introduce transformations that promote feature interactions and scale management while handling potential distribution issues in the data.

- Continue using `square`, followed by scaling to handle varying ranges.
- Introduce `sqrt` for transformations that can help normalize the distribution of potentially skewed data.
- Apply `stand_scaler` to keep features centered around the mean with unit variance.

2026-01-13 11:44:22,408 - INFO - llm output = Given the examples provided and the operations available, it seems that a combination of feature transformations can be utilized to enhance the prediction capabilities. The latter transformations in both sets have used a combination of complex operations such as `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, `sqrt`, and `sin`, showing an inclination towards non-linear scaling and squashing functions which generally help stabilize and normalize data.

To create an improved feature set derived from both examples:

Features:

```
[f1 f4 sqrt quan_trans tanh + minmax_scaler , f1 f4 sqrt tanh minmax_scaler reciprocal + , f4 tanh minmax_scaler reciprocal f1 + sqrt , f1 log f4 + tanh minmax_scaler reciprocal , f3 minmax_scaler f4 sqrt tanh + , f1 f4 minmax_scaler sqrt tanh + , f3 sin f4 sqrt minmax_scaler tanh + , f4 sqrt stand_scaler f1 + tanh minmax_scaler]
```

Explanation:

1. Combined `sqrt`, `quan_trans`, `tanh`, and `minmax_scaler` over `f1` and `f4` to exploit both squashing and scaling operations for greater information capture.
   
2. Applied `log` transformation over `f1` and added `tanh` and `minmax_scaler` to explore log scaling combined with normalization.

3. Used `stand_scaler` with `f4` combined with `f1` to normalize features ensuring variance stabilization. 

4. Incorporated `sin` transformation followed by `sqrt` and `minmax_scaler` over `f3` and `f4` to explore deeply non-linear composite features.
