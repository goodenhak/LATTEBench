2026-01-14 14:13:48,907 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations and the goal of improving predictive accuracy for wine quality, let's consider a new set of features incorporating elements and transformations from both examples, aiming to enhance the modeling capability.

1. Use a combination of original features with transformations like reciprocal and standard scaling to normalize and highlight feature interactions.
2. Incorporate multiple combinations of interactions, especially involving important features like alcohol content and acidity, as these have strong specifications related to wine quality.
3. Utilize non-linear transformations such as tanh and reciprocal where appropriate to capture potential nonlinear relationships.

Here's a proposed feature set that incorporates these principles:

```
[f1 ,f7 ,f10 ,f7 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal ,f7 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f6 f1 stand_scaler * ,f6 f4 stand_scaler * ,f6 f7 stand_scaler * ,f6 f10 stand_scaler * ,f1 tanh ,f4 tanh ,f7 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f6 f5 / tanh ,f7 f10 reciprocal * ,f6 f10 reciprocal * ,f6 f10 reciprocal stand_scaler * ,f10 stand_scaler f10 * ,f1 f10 / ,f7 f10 / stand_scaler ,f6 f10 reciprocal / ,f6 f3 minmax_scaler / ,f3 minmax_scaler]
```

This feature set combines the interactive effects across multiple attributes while applying transformations that might capture both linear and nonlinear relationships in the data, thus potentially enhancing the predictive accuracy for the wine quality score.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Use of `cos` Transformation:** Cosine has been used more widely, similar to the use of `sin` in the example, to capture periodic patterns in the data.
   
2. **Combination of Transformations:** Combining transformations like `log` and `sqrt` can help capture complex non-linear relationships within features. 

3. **Use of `cube` and `reciprocal`:** Adding `cube` and `reciprocal` transformations can help in identifying extreme values and scaling issues, thus improving model sensitivity. 

4. **`minmax_scaler` for Normalization:** Normalizing certain features to a specific range to ensure that the model isn't biased towards features with larger absolute values.

5. **Higher-order Feature Interactions:** Creating interactions through addition and combining them with transformations like `log`, `cube`, and `sqrt` to introduce new aspects of feature variability.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Combination of Features**: Start with using all available original features (`f0` to `f10`) without transformation to provide a comprehensive base.

2. **Scaling**: Use `minmax_scaler` for features with wide ranges which can help normalize them to a common scale:
    - Apply `minmax_scaler` to all original features for initial scaling.
    - Reapply `minmax_scaler` on select features (`f1`, `f3`, `f4`, `f7`, `f10`) for additional normalization.

3. **Advanced Transformations**:
    - Use `tanh` transformation for select features (`f2`, `f7`, `f10`) to handle non-linear relationships.
    - Implement `stand_scaler` on features with significant dispersion (`f5`, `f6`, `f8`, `f2`) to ensure zero mean and unit variance.
    - Incorporate the `cube` transformation on features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f7`) to capture potential high-order nonlinear interactions.

These transformations are intended to harness different aspects of the feature values and relationships to improve the prediction task's efficacy.

2026-01-14 14:15:04,128 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set that may potentially improve predictions, we can incorporate some feature engineering operations that can help capture complex relationships or distributions in the data. Given the examples provided and the operations available, we aim to extract more insightful features.

Here's a new feature set:

```

```

In this new feature set:

1. `f5 sqrt` is added to consider the square root transformation of `f5`, which often helps normalize skewed data.
2. `f4 reciprocal f5 /` encapsulates an interaction between features `f4` and `f5` using division.
3. `f1 log` to capture nonlinear effects, especially if `f1` exhibits exponential trends.
4. `f6 - f4 *` introduces a subtraction interaction between the standardized `f6` and `f4` which can reveal differences relative to sulphur dioxide levels.

- Use operations like `quanh_trans`, `cube`, and `log` to capture non-linear relationships and potential interactions.
- Emphasize normalizing techniques (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) for helping the model focus on variance and sensitivity.
- Integrate interactions among multiple features (e.g., `f6`, `f7`, `f10`) to capture interdependent effects.
- Apply `sqrt`, `cos`, `cube`, `tanh`, and `log` transformations to address the potentially non-linear nature of wine quality influences.

2026-01-14 14:15:18,353 - INFO - llm output = To create a more effective feature set for predicting wine quality, we can apply more complex feature transformations and incorporate interactions between features. Given the examples and the requirement to improve upon them, focusing on features related to alcohol (f10) can be a good strategy since it's typically influential on wine quality.

Feature Engineering Proposal:

1. Integrate feature interactions and higher-order terms:
   - Incorporate squared and cubed terms of alcohol content, as these can capture non-linear relationships with the target variable.
   - Use reciprocal transformations to capture diminishing returns or inversely proportional relationships.

2. Implement advanced feature transformations with the goal of normalizing data and capturing inherent distribution characteristics:
   - Scale transformations via standardization and normalization ensuring any transformed feature distribution aligns more closely with a normal distribution, which is often ideal for predictive modeling.
   
Here's the proposed feature set, keeping the format consistent:

```
[f10 f10 * , f10 f10 * f10 * , f10 f7 + f10 * , f10 f4 + f10 * , f10 f0 + f10 * , f10 f10 * f1 f10 + + , f10 f10 * f2 f10 + + , f10 f10 * f3 f10 + + , f10 f10 * f4 f10 + + , f10 f10 * f5 f10 + + , f10 f10 * f6 f10 + + , f10 reciprocal , f10 reciprocal f10 reciprocal * , f10 f10 reciprocal + , f10 f6 + cubic , f10 f7 + cubic , f10 f10 + f7 f10 reciprocal + + , f10 f10 + f4 f10 reciprocal + + , f10 f10 + f0 f10 reciprocal + + , f10 f10 + f3 f10 reciprocal + + , f10 f4 reciprocal f10 reciprocal + , f10 f4 reciprocal f10 f0 reciprocal + ]
```

Explanation of transformations:

1. **f10 f10 * , f10 f10 * f10 *:**
   - Exploring non-linear relationships by incorporating squared and cubed terms for alcohol, a critical component influencing wine quality and thus highly prioritized.

2. **f10 reciprocal:**
   - Reciprocal transformation is useful for handling skewed distributions, effectively linearizing relationships, particularly within constrained ranges such as alcohol content.

3. **cubic and interactions:**
   - Using cubic powers helps model complex polynomial relationships between predictors and target variables, enhancing the model's ability to capture nuanced patterns.

This feature set emphasizes capturing complex interactions and maintaining mathematical intricacies, anticipating improved performance in quality prediction models through enhanced interpretative feature design.

Explanation of improvements:

1. **Use of `tanh` on `f5`:** Tanh can help in squashing values and handling outliers, potentially improving the feature representation for decision boundaries.

2. **Exploit interactions using division:** Using division (`/`) reveals how substances relate as ratios (e.g., acidity relative to sulfur dioxide). This could help in capturing phenomena where one feature inversely scales another.

3. **Include `stand_scaler(f6)`:** Standard scaling for better distribution properties of `f6`, allowing for better comparisons between features and possibly stabilizing the model.

4. **Multiplication of `f7` and `f10`:** Captures potential interaction effects between sulfur dioxide and alcohol that may influence perceived quality in wine.

5. **Division of `f8` by `f5`:** Could determine effectiveness or impact concentration differences on wine quality.

6. **Apply `sqrt` on `f9`:** Non-linear transformation might help extract variations in pH's effect on wine quality sensitively.

7. **Cubing `f3` and `f2`:** Exploring higher-order interactions to account for possibly complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

2026-01-14 14:16:02,329 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two examples provided, I can generate a new feature set using transformations that are likely to enhance the predictive power of the wine quality model while adhering to the representation format given. Here is a better feature set using the information provided by the two examples:

```

**Explanation:**
- I used `sqrt` transformations for a range of features to potentially stabilize variance and normalize data which can be beneficial in linear models.
- `log` transformation helps address skewness and should be used on non-negative numerical data.
- `cube` transformation provides a contrast to the potential linearity introduced, enabling capture of non-linear relationships.
- Pairwise multiplication `f0 f1 *` can capture interactions between fixed and volatile acidity.
- Division `f3 f4 /` provides a ratio that may be significant, offering insights into sugar balance versus chlorides.

These transformations are chosen to build complexity and extract potentially non-linear relationships from the dataset that could be significant for predicting wine quality.

2026-01-14 14:16:19,406 - INFO - llm output = To improve the prediction of wine quality by creating new feature sets, let's incorporate transformations and combinations that might capture underlying relationships or patterns better:

Given the examples and taking inspiration from both:

1. Include original features: `[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10]`
2. Utilize the combination of features as seen: `[f3 f6 /]`
3. Explore other mathematical transformations like reciprocal, log, and cube:
   - Reciprocal transformation to handle potential skewness: `[f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f4 reciprocal]`
   - Log transformation for suppression of extreme values: `[f5 log ,f6 log ,f7 log ,f8 log ,f9 log]`

4. Use advanced transformations like power-based manipulation and scaling:
   - Cube transformations to capture potential nonlinear relationships: `[f9 cube ,f10 cube]`
   - Standard scaling to bring all features into a consistent range: `[f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f9 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler]`

5. Add interaction terms using combinations not previously seen:
   - Consider constructive interactions: `[f0 f4 * ,f1 f5 * ,f2 f6 * ,f3 f7 * ,f8 f9 * ,f4 f10 *]`

Thus, the new feature set is:

]
```

Explanation:
- The basic features `f0` to `f10` are retained.
- Square root transformations (`sqrt`) are applied on certain features to capture non-linear relationships.
- Sine transformation (`sin`) is applied to `f5` to capture periodic or oscillating patterns.
- Subtracted differences with sulfur dioxide (`f6`) are transformed using different strategies: square root, division, multiplication, addition, cube. This can reveal underlying interactions or dependencies.
- Incorporating `cube` and `minmax_scaler` might help in emphasizing differences and scaling them appropriately.
- Using `tanh` transformation after subtraction with `f6` for `f9` and `f10` could model saturation effects or bounded changes.

These transformations and combinations aim to capture the underlying patterns and relationships between the features and the target wine quality more effectively.

Data Examples:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2026-01-14 14:17:39,088 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples you've provided and the task of predicting wine quality, it seems like the goal is to create meaningful feature interactions or transformations that could improve the predictive power of the model. Given your existing examples:

1. `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10]`
2. `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f6 f5 +]`

Let me suggest a new set of features with transformations and interactions that are potentially more useful for the prediction task:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f7 f3 /, f1 f4 *, f9 log, f10 f9 *, f2 f3 f5 + *, f10 f0 /]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each added feature:

- `f7 f3 /`: Ratio of density to residual sugar. This could help identify wines with unusual sugar content relative to their density, which might affect quality.
- `f1 f4 *`: Interaction between volatile acidity and chlorides. Both can affect taste, and their interaction might be predictive of quality.
- `f9 log`: Logarithm of sulphates. Since sulphates can affect taste and preservative qualities, transforming it might capture non-linear effects.
- `f10 f9 *`: Interaction between alcohol and sulphates, potentially capturing their combined influence on taste and preservation.
- `f2 f3 f5 + *`: Interaction between citric acid, residual sugar, and free sulfur dioxide. Sugary wines with specific acid profiles might have distinct quality ratings.
- `f10 f0 /`: Ratio of alcohol to fixed acidity, potentially capturing the balance of strength and acidity which can impact wine preference.

These engineered features aim to integrate domain knowledge and possible non-linear relationships between existing features for better prediction of wine quality.

Explanation of new transformations:
- `f0 f6 /`: Interaction feature capturing the ratio, potentially indicating balance between components.
- `f3 log`: Log transformation can help in stabilizing variance and bringing skewed distributions closer to normal.
- `f4 reciprocal`: Captures inverse relationships, which can be meaningful if certain features have a stronger impact at lower values.
- `tanh f5`: Applies hyperbolic tangent transformation, providing non-linear scaling that keeps the values within a bounded range (-1, 1).
- `sqrt f9`: Further square root transformation can help linearize certain relationships.
- `f9 f10 *`: Interaction term that captures combined effect of density and alcohol content.
- `stand_scaler f1`: Standard scaling f1 could help in making this feature have zero mean and unit variance, potentially useful if volatile.acidity has strong influence.
- `minmax_scaler f8`: Apply scaling between 0 and 1, useful for features you're combining into other transformations.
- `f1 f10 cos *`: Interaction with cosine transformation might capture periodic relationships or cycles between acidity and alcohol.
- `f0 f9 f10 / *`: Complex interaction that could capture balance between multiple components.
- `f7 square`: Squaring density might highlight its effect in a nonlinear fashion.
- `sigmoid f2`: Sigmoid function can squash output to [0,1], potentially useful for citric.acid to highlight nonlinear thresholds.

2026-01-14 14:18:50,975 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we can combine some of the transformation techniques used in the provided examples and introduce new ones that might be beneficial for predictive accuracy. The idea is to capture different types of relationships and data distributions effectively.

Here's a new feature set example:
```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f5 f3 / ,f3 log ,f2 cube ,f9 sqrt ,f10 reciprocal ,f1 f0 * tanh]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Standard Scaling**: Applied to features `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4]` to normalize them based on mean and standard deviation, which is essential for many models.

2. **Min-Max Scaling**: Applied to `[f7, f8, f9, f10]` to scale features within the range [0, 1], preserving relationships in the data for neural networks and gradient-based methods.

3. **Feature Interactions**: 
   - `f5 f3 /`: Ratio of free sulfur dioxide to residual sugar, highlighting possible correlation between sweetness and preservation.
   - `log f3`: Log transformation of residual sugar to handle any skewed distribution.

4. **Non-linear transformations**:
   - `cube f2`: Cubing citric acid might reveal non-linear relationships with target.
   - `sqrt f9`: Square root of sulphates for handling possible skewness and emphasis on minor variance.
   - `reciprocal f10`: On alcohol content, this might help in situations where higher alcohol levels inversely affect outcomes.
   
5. **Complex Interaction**:
   - `[f1 f0 * tanh]`: Tanh function applied to the product of volatile and fixed acidity, creating non-linear interaction beneficial for capturing underlying complexities.

These features hypothetically provide better modeling capabilities by offering a diverse representation of the data through scaling, interaction, and transformation techniques.

To improve feature engineering further, let's consider incorporating transformations that can help enhance non-linear relationships, interactions, and more complex dependencies between features.

Here's a new feature set using the postfix notation, aiming for a more nuanced transformation:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10,  
f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler,

f6 log, f7 stand_scaler,  
f0 f9 +, f10 f8 -,  
f2 sigmoid f3 -,  
f5 tanh f8 /,  
f6 reciprocal,  
f9 f1 *,  
f10 f7 cube]

In this feature set:

1. **Min-Max Scaling**: This transformation is applied to all features to normalize values between a specific range, capturing the scale differences among the features.
2. **Feature Interaction**: Multiplying f0 and f1, and similarly other interactions, helps capture possible synergistic effects.
3. **Non-linear Transformation**: Applying square root, logarithm, and reciprocal transformations can reveal non-linear relationships.
4. **Complex Operations**: Operations like sigmoid and cube can enhance the exploration of complex relationships vital for predictive modeling.
5. **Standard Scaling and Subtraction**: Operations like standard scaling and subtraction are used to retain differences and standardize features further, enhancing model predictions. 

These transformations and interactions are chosen to capture potential patterns and relationships that could improve the prediction of wine quality.

- Sigmoid transformation on f5 which is likely the free.sulfur.dioxide to understand its bounded impact better.
- Log transformation on f6 likely representing total.sulfur.dioxide, which often helps in stabilizing variance and normalizing distributions.
- Reciprocal transformation for f9 which might be representing sulphates, potentially useful in capturing inverse relationships.
- Cube transformation for f3 likely residual.sugar to enhance nonlinear aspects.

**Key improvements:**
- Used `minmax_scaler` for core features to ensure features are within the same range, aiding model performance.
- Applied the `sqrt` function on `free.sulfur.dioxide` and `total.sulfur.dioxide` to reduce skewness and variability.
- Log transformation applied to `alcohol` after min-max scaling to handle potential non-normality.
- Created interaction features (`chlorides/total.sulfur.dioxide`, `pH*volatile.acidity`) that capture relationships between features that might impact wine quality.
- Utilized `tanh` on the interaction of `density` and `pH`, a function that maps values between -1 and 1, acting as an additional scaling mechanism that may improve the model's ability to capture nuances in these features.

### Explanation of Transformations:

1. **Min-Max Scaling**: Scales each feature to a 0-1 range, which helps in normalization of the data for models sensitive to scale variations.

2. **Feature Interactions**: Multiplication of consecutive feature pairs to capture potential interaction effects that might influence wine quality.

3. **Standard Scaling**: Scaling features to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, which helps models that assume normally distributed data.

4. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - **Cube**: Applied to capture potential cubed relationships.
   - **Tanh, Cos, Sin, Sigmoid**: Diverse non-linear functions to explore possible non-linear patterns within the data.
   
5. **Division**: Especially for sulphates and free sulfur dioxide, ratios could be relevant for determinating wine quality due to potential threshold effects.

- **Trigonometric Additions**: Additional positional trigonometric transformations (`f5 cos`) for more nuanced periodic behavior capture.
- **Division Operation**: `f10 f3 /` can provide insight into relative behavior between these features, potentially capturing a ratio effect.

2026-01-14 14:20:46,736 - INFO - llm output = To enhance the wine quality prediction, we can create additional features using various transformations on the given features, inspired by the examples provided.

```

Explanation of the new transformations:
- `f5 sqrt`: Continuing the use of square root transformation to potentially stabilize variance.
- `f3 minmax_scaler`: Scaling `f3` to a [0,1] range, which can help normalize this feature and improve model performance.
- `f8 tanh`: Applying hyperbolic tangent on `f8` might capture non-linear relationships better for pH values.
- `f10 stand_scaler`: Standardizing `f10` to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 can help align the alcohol feature magnitude with others, benefiting models that assume data distribution.

These selected transformations aim to balance retaining known effective approaches and introducing variability or scale correction to the features, potentially improving the model's predictions.

- `f6 sqrt`: The square root transformation of the total sulfur dioxide, which might reveal nonlinear relationships.
- `f10 log`: The logarithm of the alcohol content, as alcohol often has a significant nonlinear impact on wine quality.
- `f10 f9 /`: The ratio of alcohol to sulfates, helping to understand their interaction.
- `f0 f7 * sqrt`: The square root of the product of fixed acidity and density, exploring their combined effect on wine quality.

### Explanation:

- **Square Roots:** Already observed in the previous example, this transformation can reduce skewness and make the distribution more symmetric, potentially boosting model performance for continuous features.

- **Logarithm:** Applied to `f3`, `f5`, and `f10`, the logarithmic transformation is beneficial for features with wide ranges, such as residual sugar and alcohol content, helping to stabilize variance and reduce the impact of outliers.

- **Reciprocal:** Applied to `f4`, `f9`, and `f10`, reciprocals can help transform features, especially those that involve concentrations or rates (like chlorides and sulphates), enhancing feature sensitivity in models.

- **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh):** Applied to `f10`, this transformation brings values into the range (-1, 1) and can be useful for normalizing features, making neural network training smoother by keeping the inputs within a bounded range.

By integrating diverse operations, including those involving scaling and non-linear transformations, this feature set aims to encapsulate complex interactions that might correlate with wine quality, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

In this feature set:

- I've kept features like `f6 sigmoid` and `f6 quan_trans` from the latter example for potential nonlinear transformation benefits.
- The log transformation often helps normalize skewed data, hence `f10 log`.
- Comparisons with `f5` using subtraction from other features allow modeling relative differences, which could be informative for understanding quality dynamics.
- Additional transformations and combinations are introduced:
  - `f0 f7 +`: Summing fixed acidity with density may capture dilution effects.
  - `f1 f9 *`: Multiplication of volatile acidity by sulphates might highlight interactions related to wine preservation.
  - `f2 f8 /`: Division of citric acid by pH could explore acidity balance.
  - `f3 f5 sqrt`: Square root transformation on residual sugar and free sulfur dioxide might help in normalizing skewness.
  - `f4 f6 cube`: Cubing chlorides and total sulfur dioxide explores nonlinear interactions which might affect preservation.
  - `f10 f9 tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent function applied to alcohol and sulphates might capture nonlinear relationships.
  - `f5 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling the free sulfur dioxide typically aids in bringing it to a standard normal distribution. 

These engineered features aim to provide more diverse and informative inputs for modeling wine quality.

```

Here is the rationale for some new features:
- Added logarithmic transformation for `f1` (volatile acidity), which might help stabilize variance and normalize the data since it has a relatively low range.
- Applied min-max scaling to `f3` (residual sugar), which has a wide range and could benefit from scaling.
- Standard scaling `f6` (total sulfur dioxide) can centralize the feature around its mean for further compatibility with algorithms sensitive to scaled data.
- Square root transformation applied to `f10` (alcohol content) to address any potential skewness in its distribution.
- Interaction terms such as `f2*f4` and `f5*f7` can capture combined effects that single features do not reveal, such as any combined effect of citric acid and chlorides or free sulfur dioxide and density. 

These additional engineered features make the data more suitable for various models, potentially leading to better predictive performance.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f5 sigmoid ,f10 log ,f2 cube ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f6 sqrt ,f9 tanh f10 reciprocal]
```

### Explanation of Transformations:

1. **f5 sigmoid**: This transformation is maintained from the second example and can help in rescaling features to a 0-1 range, useful for possibly nonlinear relationships.
   
2. **f10 log**: Applying logarithm to the alcohol feature might help normalize the distribution, particularly if it's skewed.

3. **f2 cube**: Cubing citric acid could highlight relationships by amplifying differences, especially in distributions where slight deviations are impactful.

4. **f0 minmax_scaler**: This scaling rescales fixed acidity values to the range [0, 1], making it easier to compare across features.

5. **f3 stand_scaler**: Ensures residual sugar is transformed to a standardized scale (mean = 0, std = 1), which is useful if it’s normally distributed.
   
6. **f6 sqrt**: Applying square root to total sulfur dioxide can help stabilize variance and normalize the data, especially effective for features with wide range.
   
7. **f9 tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent transformation on sulphates can help in handling values and creating non-linear relationships by rescaling them between -1 and 1.

8. **f10 reciprocal**: Reciprocal transformation of alcohol further investigates inverse relationships that might occur with the target quality variable.

These transformations are intended to potentially boost the performance of models by revealing hidden patterns and reducing noise, improving the signal-to-noise ratio for predicting wine quality.

Let's further build on this by integrating combinations of transformations and additional scaling methods:

```

In this new feature set:

- Continuation of widespread transformations (e.g., square root, reciprocal, logarithm) to capture non-linear effects that might not be evident in raw data.
- Application of `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` should capture variance across different scales and potentially enhance model convergence during training.
- Usage of `sigmoid` on features to normalize and bound them between 0 and 1.
- Utilization of `quan_trans`, which is a quantile transformer that maps data to a normal distribution.

- I included interaction terms such as `f0 f1 *`, `f2 f3 *`, `f1 f4 *`, and `f8 f9 *` to capture potential multiplicative relationships between features.
- I added a simple additive interaction `f5 f6 +` to capture potential additive effects.

### Explanation:

1. **Square Root and Logarithmic Transformations**: Retained for most features for potential normalization and reducing skewness.
2. **Reciprocal Transformations**: Used selectively for features where inverse relationships might provide insights, particularly for features with a wide range.
3. **Tanh Transformation**: Applied to `f10` to scale it between -1 and 1, potentially helping in capturing saturation effects.
4. **Min-Max Scaler and Standard Scaler**: These are additional ways to normalize data and possibly improve model learning by ensuring all features contribute equally.
5. **Feature Interaction and Polynomial Features**: New interactions created by multiplying and dividing key features, which might capture combined effects that affect wine quality.
6. **Cube Transformation**: For one feature to ensure higher-order transformation might reveal complex relations.
7. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Between key features to capture linear combinations and contrasts in their values.

This new feature set aims to enrich the dataset with a variety of transformations to provide the predictive model with as much useful information as possible.

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformations:** These transformations can help capture nonlinear relationships between features that could impact wine quality.
   
2. **Interactions (e.g., f0 f5 *):** Feature interactions can reveal dependencies between elements that are not apparent when considering variables in isolation.

3. **Reciprocals and scalers:** Reciprocals can capture inverse relationships, and scaling methods like minmax and standard scaling can bring features to comparable ranges, beneficial for models sensitive to scale differences.

4. **Quantile Transformation (e.g., f9 quan_trans):** Helps achieve a uniform distribution, potentially improving prediction accuracy for skewed data.

5. **Tanh Transformation:** Could be beneficial for features with large ranges, compressing them to a bounded interval.

6. **Cube Transformation (e.g., f0 cube):** This could capture more complex nonlinear relationships for the fixed.acidity feature.

This set of engineered features attempts to improve prediction accuracy by exploring relationships among the features, potentially revealing hidden patterns and contributing to a more expressive model.

**Explanation**:

- Original features ([f0, f1, ..., f10]) are retained as they provide the baseline for the model.
  
- **Transformations based on existing examples**:
  - `f5 sigmoid`: Helps normalize f5, potentially beneficial as sigmoid bounds values between 0 and 1.
  - `f6 log`: Often used for positive-only data, effectively scales down large values of total sulfur dioxide.

- **New feature transformations**:
  - `f0 f6 - sqrt`: Applying square root scaling after subtracting f6 helps handle skewness in data.
  - `f1 f6 - cube`: Cubing can accentuate differences in the data after subtraction.
  - `f2 f6 - tanh`: Tanh is similar to sigmoid but steeper, can handle data with negative values.
  - `f3 f6 - reciprocal`: Useful where high values of f3 relative to f6 are of interest.
  - `f4 f6 - square`: Squaring can emphasize variations in chlorides after f6 subtraction.
  - `f7 f6 - log` and `f8 f6 - minmax_scaler`: Log transformation scales down large values and min-max scaling normalizes range.
  - `f9 f6 - stand_scaler`: Applies standard scaling post subtraction to adjust for varying scales.
  - `f10 f6 - quan_trans`: Quantile transformation makes data distribution more uniform.
  - `f10 reciprocal`: This can help capture inverse relationships, especially for alcohol content.

Data Examples:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f5 sigmoid]
 
 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f5 sin ,f0 f6 - ,f1 f6 - ,f2 f6 - ,f3 f6 - ,f4 f6 - ,f7 f6 - ,f8 f6 - ,f9 f6 - ,f10 f6 - ,f5 sin f6 -]

2026-01-14 14:24:57,994 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples you provided, the second feature set builds on the first by adding differences between various features and `f6`, as well as adding the sine of those differences. Let's create a new feature set that includes these transformations and further enhancements to improve the prediction of wine quality. 

One potential enhancement could be to add features representing interactions and transformations of original features, such as products of key features, scaled versions, or other nonlinear transformations. Here is a feature set suggestion:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f5 sin ,f0 f6 - ,f1 f6 - ,f2 f6 - ,f3 f6 - ,f4 f6 - ,f7 f6 - ,f8 f6 - ,f9 f6 - ,f10 f6 - ,f5 sin f6 - ,f0 f10 * ,f1 f9 * ,f2 f8 * ,f3 f7 * ,f4 f6 * ,f5 f6 * ,f0 tanh ,f1 sigmoid ,f2 log ,f3 sqrt ,f4 reciprocal]
```

**Explanation of Additions:**

1. **Products of Key Features**: For instance, `f0 f10 *`, `f1 f9 *`, etc., to capture interaction effects between features that might not be linear.
   
2. **Nonlinear Transformations**: Including transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `reciprocal` for features `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f4`, respectively, to capture nonlinear relationships in the data.

These additions aim to capture complex relationships and interactions between features that a simple linear model may miss, potentially leading to better predictive performance on the wine quality task.
