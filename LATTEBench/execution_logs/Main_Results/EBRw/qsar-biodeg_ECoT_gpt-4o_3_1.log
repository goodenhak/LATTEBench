you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:00:52,161 - INFO - llm output = To improve feature engineering based on the given two examples, we will focus on a combination of transformations that offer a balance between complexity and performance enhancement. The objective is to maintain a set of transformed features that can help in classification tasks, specifically enhancing the prediction capability for the biodegradability classification problem at hand.

Here's a new set of transformed feature expressions:

```
[f0 ,f2 ,f4 ,f6 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f12 ,f13 ,f15 ,f17 ,f19 ,f21 ,f24 ,f26 ,f27 ,f29 ,f30 ,f32 ,f33 ,f35 ,f37 ,f40 ,f22 cube ,f14 square ,f38 square ,f29 minmax_scaler ,f7 cos ,f15 f7 - sin ,f29 sqrt f7 * ,f7 minmax_scaler f29 * ,f6 f7 + reciprocal ,f12 f7 + reciprocal ,f29 cube f7 + ,f29 minmax_scaler f7 * ,f29 square f7 + ,f29 sqrt f7 * ,f7 cube f29 + ,f15 f7 - tanh ,f8 f7 + f14 * ,f8 f7 + f38 * ,f15 f7 - stand_scaler ,f14 log ,f38 log]
```

### Rationale:

1. **Utilization of non-linear transformations:** Incorporating cube, square, and square root transformations can capture non-linear patterns that might be relevant for differentiating the chemical structure's impact on biodegradability.

2. **Use of `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler`:** Normalizing features helps in reducing scale-related disturbances that may hinder the model’s performance, particularly in algorithms sensitive to the magnitude of values.

3. **Increased combinatory transformations:** Adding and combining transformed features can help in discovering interaction effects between different molecular descriptors that are pertinent to classification.

4. **Inclusion of trigonometric and logarithmic transformations:** Providing variation and capturing unique aspects that may not be observed through basic algebraic transformations. Trigonometric transformations (like sine, cosine) and logarithmic transformations are particularly handy in assessing periodic and exponentially varying features.

This approach keeps the balance between variety in transformations while allowing for complex interactions and normalization, which could offer better predictive capabilities in classification tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Normalized Transformations:** Included `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for the original and some derived features to account for scaling, which often aids in model convergence and interpretability.
2. **Repeated `stand_scaler`:** Applying `stand_scaler` multiple times can refine normalization further, capturing finer adjustments.
3. **Mathematical Transformations:** Introduced `sqrt`, `log`, `square`, `reciprocal`, and `sin/cos` for diversification of mathematical computation, addressing non-linear relationships.
4. **Combining & Transforming Features:** Created new features through simple arithmetic combinations `(f0 f7 +)` and interactions `(f3 f29 *)`, immediately scaling or applying transformations on these derived features.
5. **Transformations like `tanh` and `quan_trans`:** Incorporated advanced transformations on selected features for non-linearity.

This feature set introduces diversity in transformations and scaling, leveraging both simple arithmetic interactions and advanced mathematical transformations, potentially enriching the predictive capacity of the model while focusing on feature interaction and redundancy elimination.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:01:25,070 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that builds on the previous sets while aiming for improved prediction capabilities, I'll seek to incorporate more diverse transformations and interactions, utilize scaling and non-linear transformations, and ensure that the operations are meaningfully applied to the feature set. Here's a new feature set based on the examples provided:

In this improved feature set:
- **f29 tanh**: Apply a non-linear transformation to exploit potential complex relationships.
- **f7 reciprocal**: Explore inverse relationships for additional insights.
- **f29 sqrt f7 sqrt +**: Combining transformed features to identify hidden patterns.

2026-01-12 15:01:34,633 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two sets of feature transformations provided, the second set incorporates a more diverse combination of operations and interactions among the features, indicating an effort to create comprehensive and potentially informative features. However, it is considerably long and potentially complex. When creating a new improved feature set, it is important to balance complexity with interpretability and computational efficiency. Let's aim for a compact yet enriched feature set that includes fundamental transformations and interactions that might aid the predictive model's performance.

Here is a revised feature set that draws inspiration from both examples:

```

- **Basic Features:** Retain essential individual features (e.g., `f1, f2, f3`), which represent fundamental characteristics of the dataset, ensuring that their potential utility is preserved.
- **Feature Interactions:** Include simple multiplications and additions among selected features, allowing the model to utilize meaningful feature interactions (e.g., `f1 f2 *`, `f2 f3 *`, `f0 f9 +`).
- **Transformations:** Use numerical transformations to handle potential non-linear relationships (e.g., `f22 sigmoid`, `f29 square`, `f17 log`, and `f26 sqrt`).
- **Complex Combinations:** Include a few more complex interactions and operations to expand the feature space (e.g., `f15 f14 + f7 f27 +` and `f15 f38 + f7 f2 +`).

This revised set should provide an enriched feature space that incorporates both basic representations and complex interactions, which could potentially enhance the predictive performance while maintaining interpretability and manageability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:01:38,295 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the given examples, I'll incorporate a combination of operations that can add further nonlinear transformations and scaling, and possibly interactions, whilst considering the importance and range of features. Here is a new set of transformed features:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 tanh ,f14 log ,f38 log ,f15 tanh ,f15 minmax_scaler ,f29 f22 * ,f29 minmax_scaler ,f29 f22 * f22 * ,f29 f22 * f15 * ,f29 f22 * f7 * ,f15 stand_scaler ,f29 f22 * minmax_scaler ,f29 sqrt ,f14 cos ,f29 reciprocal ,f7 sigmoid ,f39 sqrt ,f12 tanh ,f16 tanh ,f31 reciprocal]
```

This new set includes:

- `f14 cos`: Using cosine transformation on `f14`, adding a periodic transformation.
- `f29 reciprocal`: Applying reciprocal transformation on `f29` to handle high magnitude values.
- `f7 sigmoid`: Using a sigmoid on `f7`, which can compress magnitude-based variations into a bounded range.
- Additional nonlinear transformations via `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `reciprocal` methods to interact and scale features further. 

This setup aims to enhance the feature interactions and nonlinear properties beneficial for downstream tasks such as classification or regression, specifically targeting complex relationships in the dataset.

2026-01-12 15:01:44,831 - INFO - llm output = When creating a new feature set, it is beneficial to focus on transformations that offer greater complexity and capture more nuanced relationships within the data. Here is a proposed new feature set combining ideas from the previous examples:

```
[f0, f6, f12, f14, f21, f26, f35, f38, f40, f22 f14 +, f22 f38 +, f22 f38 + sqrt, f22 f21 + sqrt, f22 f22 f14 + +, f22 f22 f38 + +, f22 f29 +, f14 f22 +, f38 f22 +, f14 f14 + reciprocal, f38 f21 + reciprocal, f6 f29 +, f40 f14 +, f40 f38 +, f21 log, f26 log, f35 log, f38 log, f21 f29 * log, f26 f29 * log, f35 f29 * log, f38 f29 * log, f14 f40 + sqrt, f38 f40 + sqrt, f21 f14 * reciprocal, f35 f14 * reciprocal, f21 f38 * reciprocal, f35 f38 * reciprocal, f14 cube, f38 cube, f40 cube, f22 f14 f29 + sqrt, f22 f38 f29 + sqrt]
```

Explanation:
- Incorporate a combination of transformative operations such as `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, and `cube` to introduce non-linearity and capture interactions.
- Focus on interactions between key features using `+`, `*`, and logarithm operations, which can reveal higher-order relationships.
- Use operations to scale and shift feature values, and explore combinations that involve adding significant features together.
- Retain the uncomplicated features like basic addition while also using complex operations such as square root and cube for depth.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:01:54,176 - INFO - llm output = To derive a better feature set based on the examples provided, we want to leverage transformations that are likely to enhance predictive power while potentially introducing non-linear relationships and reducing dimensionality. Here's a proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f7 cos ,f7 square ,f7 f7 + ,f7 f29 / ,f7 f15 f29 + * ,f29 sqrt ,f15 tanh ,f29 f7 cube *]
```

Changes made:
- Retained some useful transformations from the second set, such as `f7 sqrt` and `f7 tanh` for their ability to capture non-linear relationships.
- Introduced new combined features like `f7 f29 /` and `f7 f15 f29 + *`, enhancing interaction terms.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Enhancements:**

1. **Added interactions:** Included additional feature interactions such as `f29 f22 * f16 *`, to capture complex relationships.

2. **Applied nonlinear transformations:** 
   - Used the `cube` operation on `f38` and `f29` to explore higher-order moments.
   - Added `reciprocal` transformation for `f22`, which could help model features with inverse relationships.

3. **Leveraged multiple transformations:** Applied `log` and `sin` transformations to expose potentially hidden relationships in feature distributions (`f14 log`, `f38 log`, `f13 sin`).

4. **Incorporated scaling:** Continued use of `tanh`, `stand_scaler`, and `minmax_scaler` on various features to ensure that transformed features remain in a compatible scale for modeling.

These enhancements focus on increasing the feature variety and introducing complexity, which might help improve model predictions for distinguishing between ready and not ready biodegradable chemicals.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:02:10,649 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, I'll combine elements from both examples and introduce a few additional transformations to enhance feature representation while considering diversity and avoid redundancy.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f29 sqrt ,f15 stand_scaler ,f14 log ,f14 sqrt ,f38 reciprocal ,f7 f7 + ,f7 f7 + quan_trans ,f7 f7 + sin ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f12 log ,f16 log ,f17 log ,f21 log ,f26 log ,f30 log ,f35 log ,f36 log ,f14 log log ,f38 log log ,f15 sqrt ,f19 log ,f20 log ,f21 sqrt ]
```

**Explanation**: 
- Retained the core original features `f0` to `f40`.
- Implemented log transformations for features found in both examples due to their ability to handle skew and improve linear separability (`f0 log`, `f1 log`, etc.).
- Retained advanced transformations like `stand_scaler`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `reciprocal` to add complexity and handle feature distributions.
- Added custom transformations and retentions (`log log`, `quan_trans`, `sin`) for uniqueness and potential non-linear relationships.
- Introduced additional logarithmic and square root transformations (`f19 log`, `f20 log`, `f21 sqrt`) to increase feature variety.

This feature set aims to enhance predictive power and model robustness by incorporating non-linear transformations and diversifying feature representation.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:02:18,437 - INFO - llm output = To enhance the feature set using the transformations given, we'll prioritize transformations that can potentially capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between features, while also aiming to reduce redundancy.

Based on the two examples provided, we'll derive a new feature set that combines some of the transformations from both examples and introduces new transformations. We'll use operations such as nonlinear transformations, scaled interactions, and feature combinations.

Here is the improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f15 cos ,f29 sin ,f7 tanh ,f7 f15 * sqrt ,f7 square ,f29 f7 * minmax_scaler ,f29 f15 + sin ,f7 reciprocal]
```

Explanation of the transformations:
1. `f7 sqrt`: Captures a nonlinear relationship from `f7`.
2. `f15 cos`: Applies a trigonometric transformation to `f15`, which can highlight cyclic patterns.
3. `f29 sin`: Uses a sine transformation on `f29`.
4. `f7 tanh`: Applies a hyperbolic tangent transformation on `f7`, frequently useful for normalization and capturing nonlinearities.
5. `f7 f15 * sqrt`: Takes the square root of the product of `f7` and `f15`, introducing interaction between the features and a nonlinear scaling.
6. `f7 square`: Squares `f7`, preserving its magnitude while allowing for potential interaction.
7. `f29 f7 * minmax_scaler`: Scales the product of `f29` and `f7`, amplifying their interaction for better normalization.
8. `f29 f15 + sin`: Sine transformation applied to the sum of `f29` and `f15`, capturing interactions and cyclic relationships.
9. `f7 reciprocal`: Applies reciprocal transformation on `f7`, which could capture inverse relationships.

These operations combine direct usage, interaction, scaling, and nonlinear transformations that might help in refining downstream prediction tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:02:24,727 - INFO - llm output = Sure, I'll create a better feature set by applying transformations and combining operations strategically. Given the two examples, I'll focus on creating new derived features that could potentially provide more useful insights for classification. Here it is:

```plaintext

```

This new feature set includes:
- Using both `tanh` and `sin` transformations on `f15`, considering their complementary capabilities of capturing non-linearities.
- Computing the product of `f7` and `f29` followed by the `sqrt` transformation to capture potential interactions.
- Utilizing `minmax_scaler` on the product of `f29` and `f7` to promote scale uniformity for machine learning models.
- Adding the `reciprocal` transformation to better capture inverse relationships, which may be crucial in some cases.
- Introducing a `cube` transformation on `f15` to capture relevant higher-order interactions. 

These transformations aim to enhance classification capability by bolstering feature richness and incorporating non-linearity into the model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

 f29 cube ,           // cube transformation of feature f29 for non-linear scaling
 f2 square ,          // square transformation to emphasize larger deviations for feature f2
 f35 sqrt ,           // square root transformation for stabilization of feature f35 values
 f11 f25 / ,          // ratio between features f11 and f25, representing some form of dependency factor
 f27 stand_scaler ,   // standard scaling of feature f27 for normalization
 f34 f6 + ,           // combination of f34 and f6, potentially capturing joint interactions
 f12 reciprocal ,     // reciprocal transformation for inverse scaling of feature f12
 f38 log ,            // logarithmic transformation to manage large deviations in feature f38
 f24 minmax_scaler]   // min-max scaling to normalize the distribution of feature f24

This feature set combines the transformations from both examples, while introducing additional diverse feature manipulations that might capture complex relationships or stabilize inherent distributions making the downstream classification task potentially more robust.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

``` 

In this new feature set:
- I've retained many useful basic transformations such as logarithms, min-max scaling, and standard scaling.
- I've incorporated trigonometric transformations like `sin` and `cos` to help capture potential cyclic or periodic relationships in the data with the new inclusion `f7 f29 * cos`.
- The reciprocal and square root transformations have been added (f29 reciprocal, f29 sqrt) to capture inverse relationships and reduce the scale of large values.
- I adjusted some combinations to involve transformations on multiple features `f29 f22 minmax_scaler` to potentially enhance the interaction strength.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Added Transformations**:
   - **f8 log**: Applying log transformation can help produce a more normal distribution, which can aid models sensitive to skewed data.
   - **f0 f1 / tanh**: A combination of ratios followed by a non-linear transformation (tanh) can capture interaction effects that linear models might miss.

These additions aim to preserve the original concepts of data representation while enhancing it with additional statistical and mathematical transformations that could reveal more intricate patterns in the dataset.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f7 cos ,f7 square ,f7 f7 +]

2026-01-12 15:02:54,021 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets you have provided, let's create a new feature set by combining the most useful transformations from both sets while avoiding redundancy. Here are some potential transformations that might help improve the model's predictive capabilities:

- Focus on non-linear and scaling transformations which can capture complex relationships and normalize the data.
- Avoid overly complex or redundant transformations that don't contribute additional value over existing transformations.

Here is a new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f7 cos ,f7 square ,f15 f7 - ,f29 cube ,f15 f7 - minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler]
```

Explanation:

- Retained the basic features (`f0, f1, ..., f40`) as they are foundational to forming the relationships.
- From the first set, included `f7 sqrt`, `f7 sin`, and `f15 cos` for managing non-linearities, and `f7 tanh` to compress variance.
- From the second set, chosen `f15 f7 -`, `f29 cube`, and `f15 f7 - minmax_scaler` to capture differences/changes between features and normalize the output.
- Avoided redundant transformations when similar ones are already included from the other example.
- Ensured the final set maintains most diversity in transformations while keeping the set relatively compact to avoid overfitting.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:03:01,379 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets you provided, the task is to propose a better set by leveraging the existing transformations and creating additional meaningful transformations that could further improve predictions. 

We'll maintain all features and operations from the existing sets, while introducing new features and transformations that might enhance predictive capabilities.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,

f7 cos ,f7 square ,f7 f7 + ,
f8 f9 *, f20 f21 + , f1 log , f7 f9 / , f19 cube , f11 reciprocal]
```

In this proposal:
- `f8 f9 *` and `f20 f21 +` combine the interactions between features as a product and sum, respectively, which might highlight critical relationships.
- `f1 log` adds a logarithmic transformation, useful for reducing skewness in skewed data.
- `f7 f9 /` introduces a ratio between two features that could reveal a meaningful relationship.
- `f19 cube` applies a cubic transformation, possibly uncovering nonlinear patterns.
- `f11 reciprocal` uses the reciprocal transformation, which is beneficial when dealing with inverse relationships.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Interactions:** Introduced interaction terms (`f30 f39 *` and `f30 f39 * f16 sin`) to capture multiplicative relationships between features which might be relevant for distinguishing between classes.

2. **Non-linear Transformations:** Combined transformations such as `tanh`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `cos` with interactions, which might capture subtle patterns in data.

3. **Feature Scaling:** Kept "minmax_scaler" and "stand_scaler" transformation to standardize features and improve convergence in learning algorithms.

4. **Reciprocal and Rational Operations:** Used `reciprocal` and `/` in interactions like `f7 f38 /` to potentially better handle skewed distributions.

5. **Augmented Feature Space:** Added interaction terms and combinations that are complex yet balanced, enabling more expressive modeling capabilities that could lead to better predictions.

By diversifying the types of transformations and interactions between features, the new feature set aims to encapsulate a richer representation of the data, potentially improving model learning and classification outcomes.

2026-01-12 15:03:12,925 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the two examples provided, I'll focus on feature transformations and introduce additional combinations. The goal is to capture non-linear relationships and interactions while maintaining some level of interpretability. Here's the new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f7 tanh, f14 log, f38 log, f15 tanh, f15 minmax_scaler, f29 f22 *, f29 minmax_scaler, f29 f22 * f22 *, f29 f22 * f15 *, f29 f22 * f7 *, f15 stand_scaler, f29 f22 * minmax_scaler, f29 square, f29 f22 * sin, f29 f22 * stand_scaler, f29 reciprocal, f29 f22 * cube, f22 sigmoid, f7 f22 /, f29 f7 cos]
```

This feature set adds transformations that may capture more complex relationships and interactions among features:
- `f29 reciprocal` and `f29 f22 * cube` are added to introduce non-linear terms.
- `f22 sigmoid` applies a non-linear transformation that can be especially useful for modeling binary outcomes.
- `f7 f22 /` introduces interaction between features and potential non-linear divisive interaction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 *]

2026-01-12 15:03:18,064 - INFO - llm output = To create a new set of features using the format and transformations you've provided, it's essential to build on previous feature sets, while incorporating transformations that could potentially capture more patterns or trends in the data. The second series of transformations seems to suggest a more advanced blending of scaling and non-linear transformations. Following its style, here's a new proposal:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 f8 + ,f15 f29 - log ,f29 cube minmax_scaler ,f9 f29 / sigmoid ,f7 f9 * sqrt]
```

In this new feature set:

- `f7 f8 +`: This creates a new feature by summing `f7` and `f8`.
- `f15 f29 - log`: After subtracting `f29` from `f15`, the log transformation is applied to capture a more 'scale-invariant' pattern.
- `f29 cube minmax_scaler`: Cubes `f29` and applies min-max scaling to put them in a normalized range, aiding in comparing similar features.
- `f9 f29 / sigmoid`: Divides `f9` by `f29` and then applies a sigmoid function, which helps in transforming values into a bounded range.
- `f7 f9 * sqrt`: Multiplies `f7` by `f9` and then takes the square root, potentially smoothing the data and highlighting interactions.

This feature set is designed to better normalize, scale, and capture non-linear relationships within the data, as was the trend noted in the latter example provided.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a new feature set incorporating some strategic transformations:

```text
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 tanh ,f15 cos ,f7 square ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 f38 * + ,f7 cos ,f7 log ,f22 f9 *]
```

**Explanation of changes:**

1. **Interaction Term**: `f29 f7 f38 * +` - This interaction term combines `f29`, `f7`, and `f38` through multiplication and addition, which could uncover complex relationships.
   
2. **Log Transformation**: `f7 log` - Applying log transformation to `f7` might help in stabilizing variance and normalizing skewed data.

3. **Additional Multiplication**: `f22 f9 *` - This term multiplies `f22` and `f9`, potentially exploring interactions between these features which might be relevant.

This feature set aims to enhance the representation of the dataset by employing meaningful transformations and combinations that could capture non-linear relationships and interactions among features, potentially improving predictive performance.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 *]

2026-01-12 15:03:29,869 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations and operations, let's aim to create a more refined feature set using advanced feature engineering techniques. The latter example introduced logarithmic and trigonometric transformations to the original feature set, which can be valuable in linearizing relationships or handling skewed distributions. We'll further improve upon these by incorporating more diverse transformations and interactions between features:

- For feature interactions, adding multiplicative combinations allows the model to capture relationships between features. 
- Use of scaling transformations such as `stand_scaler` or `minmax_scaler` can help standardize features, making them more suitable for models sensitive to feature magnitude.
- Applying non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, or `cube` can introduce complexities that models like neural networks can exploit.

Here's the enhanced feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f15 f14 + ,f15 f38 + ,f15 f14 + log ,f15 f38 + log ,f22 sin ,f0 f30 * ,f4 f10 * ,f9 f29 tanh ,f22 f30 + minmax_scaler ,f25 cube ,f18 f22 / stand_scaler]
```

These additions provide:
- Interactions: Such as `f0 f30 *` and `f4 f10 *` can capture relationships.
- Non-linear and scaling transformations: `f9 f29 tanh`, `f22 f30 + minmax_scaler`, and `f18 f22 / stand_scaler` adjust the distribution and scale.
- Complex transformation: `f25 cube` expands the feature space for greater representation.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:03:35,348 - INFO - llm output = To develop a better feature set based on the two examples provided, let's incorporate a combination of transformation functions that can potentially capture more complex relationships and nonlinear patterns within the data. We will build upon the second example, as it has additional transformations over the first.

Here’s an improved version:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 tanh ,f14 log ,f38 log ,f15 tanh ,f15 minmax_scaler ,f29 f22 * ,f29 minmax_scaler ,f29 f22 * f22 * ,f29 f22 * f15 * ,f29 f22 * f7 * ,f15 stand_scaler ,f29 f22 * minmax_scaler ,f29 sqrt ,f14 cos ,f29 reciprocal ,f7 sigmoid ,f39 sqrt ,f12 tanh ,f16 tanh ,f31 reciprocal ,f14 f15 * sqrt ,f22 f29 * log ,f28 f31 cube ,f30 f38 square ,f16 f12 /]
```

### Enhancements:
- **`f14 f15 * sqrt`**: Applying square root after multiplication could help stabilize variance, often useful for features with broad ranges.
- **`f22 f29 * log`**: Log transformation after multiplication is useful to manage skewness, allowing for better relationships to be captured.
- **`f28 f31 cube`**: Cubing this feature interaction may model high-order nonlinear interactions.
- **`f30 f38 square`**: Squaring enhances features capturing high values and interacting similarly scaled features to emphasize their importance linearly.
- **`f16 f12 /`**: Division could emphasize the relative importance between two features, capturing dynamics where one feature dominates or modulates another.

By applying these transformations and interaction terms, the feature set attempts to capture a more nonlinear and complex relationship within the data that could be useful for a downstream task such as classification.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Key enhancements in this feature set:
1. Added interaction terms using basic mathematical operations, utilizing the newly derived features from the previous sets.
2. Employed `tanh`, `log`, and `minmax_scaler` operations to normalize and scale features further.
3. Introduced reciprocal transformation to handle potential outliers and skewness in `f17`.
4. Added `square` of `f15` to capture non-linear relationships.
5. Leveraged the use of `log` and `tanh` combined with multiplication for complex interaction terms. 

This newly engineered feature set aims to capture more complex relationships and improve the model's robustness in classifying the biodegradability of chemicals.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin]

2026-01-12 15:03:45,567 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set using feature engineering operations, I will build upon the latter example by considering additional transformations that might capture non-linear relationships and dependencies between features effectively.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f15 cos ,f29 sin ,f7 tanh ,f7 f15 * sqrt ,f7 square ,f29 f7 * minmax_scaler ,f29 f15 + sin ,f7 reciprocal ,f15 f29 / log ,f7 f29 f15 * + cube ,f35 f9 * tanh ,f0 f40 / sqrt]
```

### Explanation of New Features:
1. **f15 f29 / log**: Logarithm transformation of the ratio of f15 and f29, capturing multiplicative relationships and potential non-linear scaling.
2. **f7 f29 f15 * + cube**: Cubic transformation on the sum of f7, the product of f29, and f15. This expands non-linear feature interactions.
3. **f35 f9 * tanh**: Uses hyperbolic tangent to transform the product between f35 and f9 to highlight interactions and constrained values.
4. **f0 f40 / sqrt**: Square root of the ratio of f0 and f40, providing smoother scaling among higher magnitude values.

These transformations include complex operations and combinations, providing stronger potential to unveil hidden, non-linear relationships between features.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f7 cos ,f7 square ,f7 f7 +]

2026-01-12 15:03:52,059 - INFO - llm output = To provide a better feature set based on the two examples given, we should aim to capture meaningful interactions and transformations that might enhance the model's ability to separate the classes effectively. Here's a proposed feature set combining ideas from both examples, but with refinements:

- Including the original features allows baselines for comparison:
  [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40]

- Apply logarithmic transformations to the sums, which can stabilize variance:
  [f15 f14 + log, f15 f38 + log]

- Sine transformation might capture periodicity or small oscillations:
  [f7 sin, f22 sin]

- Add pairwise interactions to capture feature dependencies within the data:
  [f29 f7 *]

- Square and cube transformations can capture non-linear effects with higher order interactions:
  [f7 square, f1 cube]

- Standard scaling to ensure comparability and normalize features:
  [f0 stand_scaler, f15 stand_scaler]

- MinMax scaling to ensure all features are on a consistent scale:
  [f29 minmax_scaler, f22 minmax_scaler]

- Including some trigonometric transformations to capture potential cyclical patterns:
  [f9 tanh, f10 cos]

This new feature set combination introduces interactions, transformations stabilizing variance, and normalization techniques that can potentially enhance the downstream task performance in a classification model.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set enhancement includes combinations such as addition and multiplication across multiple features, logarithmic and reciprocal transformations, as well as using the hyperbolic tangent function for intensity enhancement. These operations aim to diversify and amplify the feature interactions, potentially improving the model's ability to distinguish between the classes.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:04:04,429 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we can combine and transform the existing features using various operations to extract potentially more insightful representations for the classification task. Here's a new feature set that builds on the transformations you provided:

```
[f7 sqrt, f7 sin, f15 cos, f7 tanh, f29 sin, f7 * f9 tanh, f0 / f1, f3 + f10 cos, f4 cube, f5 square, f6 reciprocal, f9 tanh, f15 cos, f29 sigmoid]
```

The reasoning behind this choice of transformations includes:

1. Combining transformations from the original and the example such as `f7 sqrt` and `f7 sin` to capture different aspects of feature `f7`.
2. Interaction features like `f7 * f9 tanh` might capture more complex relationships between `f7` and `f9`.
3. Ratios like `f0 / f1` could be helpful in normalizing and comparing the relative importance of features.
4. Interaction between features `f3` and `f10 cos` can provide insight into overlapping or joint behaviors.
5. Using higher-order transformations like `f4 cube` and `f5 square` to model non-linear relationships.
6. The inclusion of a reciprocal transformation through `f6 reciprocal` to handle inverse relationships.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:04:10,926 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, we can aim to improve the feature transformations by leveraging functions that may enhance model interpretability and performance. The goal is to create new features that can potentially offer more distinct and useful patterns for the classification task.

Here's an improved feature set using a combination of transformations:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f7 sqrt, f14 f15 + tanh, f29 cos, f7 minmax_scaler, f22 sigmoid]
```

**Explanation**:
- Retained basic operations like `sqrt` and `sin` from the second feature set.
- Used `tanh` on the summation of `f14` and `f15` to capture non-linear interactions between those features.
- Included `cos` transformation on `f29` for cyclic pattern capture.
- Applied `minmax_scaler` on `f7` for scaling the feature into a standard range, aiding models that are sensitive to feature scales.
- Added `sigmoid` on `f22`, transforming it into a bounded range between 0 and 1, which could help interpret feature effects as probabilities. 

This combination is designed to enhance the expressiveness of the dataset with nonlinear transformations, scaling, and bounded transformations, possibly leading to better generalization of the classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set includes various transformations of the existing features, such as scaling, non-linear transformations using trigonometric functions and hyperbolic tangent, combinations of existing features, and transformations that aim to handle feature distributions (e.g., reciprocal, sigmoid, standard scaling). The goal is to introduce diversity and capture non-linear relationships which can improve the model's predictive performance when used in downstream tasks.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin]
 
 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f7 cos ,f7 square ,f7 f7 +]

2026-01-12 15:04:20,181 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, the aim is to incorporate transformations and interactions that capture more meaningful relationships or reduce dimensionality in a way that might improve the downstream task. Given the examples:

1. Transformations such as `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `square`, and interactions like multiplication (`*`) and addition (`+`) are included in the latter example to expand the feature set.
2. Operations like `square`, `cos`, and adding the feature to itself (`f7 f7 +`) can introduce non-linear relationships and help capture more complexity within the data.

Therefore, the next step is to introduce more interactions and composite transformations while maintaining the original features where beneficial. Here is a new feature set example incorporating these principles:

```  
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f7 cos ,f7 square ,f7 f7 + ,f15 f29 tanh * ,f15 log ,f15 sqrt ,f29 f7 /]
```

Explanation of improvements:

- **Interactions**: Incorporating `f15 f29 tanh *`, `f29 f7 /` leverages potential interactions in help capturing relationships between features that might be non-linearly related.
- **Transformation Diversity**: Employing transformations like `log` and `sqrt` further diversifies our representation of original features.
- **Feature Complexity**: The mix of existing features with transformations aims to balance complexity and potential meaningful combinations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Existing Transformations**: Kept `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, and `tanh` on individual features `f7` and `f29` and `f15`, which represent nonlinear transformations that can help model complex patterns.

2. **Interaction Terms**: Retained multiplication (`f29 f7 *`) and addition (`f7 f7 +`, `f7 f29 +`) to model relationships between different features.

3. **Logarithmic Transformations**: Added `log` transformation on `f7`, which can help stabilize variance when data is skewed.

4. **Min-Max Scaling**: Added Min-Max scaling for `f7`, `f15`, and `f29` to normalize the data, bringing all values onto the same scale, which is vital for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.

5. **Additional Interactions**: Introduced additional transformations using division and multiplication to explore potentially useful interactions:
   - `f7 log`: Helps in compressing the scale of the data.
   - `f29 sqrt` and `f29 cos`: Provides additional power of extraction over `f29` which seems complementary.
   -  `f7 f7 tanh`: Combined use of Tanh on `f7` along with other features to model interactions.

The approach focuses on capturing non-linear relationships, scaling sensitivities, and interaction terms that are frequently useful in enhancing typical linear models, but can also support nonlinear algorithms.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:04:36,259 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, the second set leverages transformations like logarithms that can help deal with skewed data or large variance and incorporates more mathematical operations that might help in better classification. However, there is room for further improvement by combining these operations with others or applying them to different features. Here's a proposed feature set that aims to build on the strengths of both examples:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 sqrt ,f15 f13 + log ,f36 sqrt ,f15 f14 + tanh ,f38 reciprocal ,f22 quant_trans ,f21 minmax_scaler ,f7 sin ,f29 cos ,f29 tanh ,f7 f29 * ,f22 f14 +]
```

Changes made:
1. **Log Transformation**: Applied on the indicator of molecular complexity (`f15 f13 + log`) which might help in capturing relative changes.
2. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Applied on a spectral feature (`f38 reciprocal`) to help in managing large values and improve stability.
3. **Quantile Transformation**: To make non-linear data more linear (`f22 quant_trans`) improving model predictions.
4. **Min-max scaling**: Ensures `f21` fits within a scaled range, aiding models by bound constraints.
5. **Combination of transformations**: On topological measures (`f15 f14 + tanh`) and related descriptors (`f22 f14 +`) to create enhanced compound descriptors.

2026-01-12 15:04:39,869 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on your examples, we want to explore transformations that allow for diverse and potentially informative new features. For classification tasks, creating features that help distinguish patterns between classes can be crucial. For the given dataset related to biodegradable classification, here is a suggested enhanced feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f1 f2 + sqrt ,f11 f7 * minmax_scaler]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`f1 f2 + sqrt`:** This transformation creates a new feature that reflects the interactions between features `f1` and `f2`, followed by square root scaling, which can sometimes neutralize extreme values and reveal underlying trends.

2. **`f11 f7 * minmax_scaler`:** Multiplying `f11` and `f7` while scaling the result using min-max normalization allows for a compounded effect of two features while keeping the result bounded within [0, 1]. This can help algorithms distinguish patterns with relative intensity.

As the transformations evolve, they should be designed with the context in mind: Do these components represent interactions or hidden characteristics that can more accurately predict your classification label?

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 square ,f15 cos ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f7 tanh ,f7 f13 * ,f17 stand_scaler ,f20 log ,f33 reciprocal ,f0 f4 +]
```

Changes made:
1. Removed `f7 sin`, as trigonometric transformations are less intuitive in many chemical descriptor contexts.
2. Added `f7 square` as squaring a feature can highlight more significant deviations.
3. Added `f7 f13 *` to create an interaction term that might capture joint effects.
4. Added `f17 stand_scaler` for normalization, potentially improving model stability.
5. Added `f20 log` to help stabilize variance and handle skewed distributions.
6. Added `f33 reciprocal` to transform the feature in case of non-linear relations.
7. Added `f0 f4 +` as an additional combination, capturing cumulative effects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:04:50,707 - INFO - llm output = Sure! Based on the given feature transformation sets and keeping in mind to improve feature representation for downstream tasks, I will suggest a new set of transformed features:

```

This set incorporates previous transformations and introduces some useful ones:
- Applies logarithm transformation to `f40`, which can be useful for features with a skewed distribution.
- Square root of `f8` could provide normalization for skewed distributed features.
- Multiplies `f15` and `f19` - creating interaction features which could capture complex relationships between these attributes.

Ensure to verify the transformations' relevance for the model training and evaluate the impact on predictions.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:04:55,788 - INFO - llm output = To enhance your feature set based on the two examples given, we can apply different transformations and combine them to create new features that could be valuable for the downstream task. For example, focusing on normalization and transformation methods could lead to more distinguishable features in the context of machine learning models. Here’s a better feature set based on the examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 tanh ,f15 f7 - minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f29 cube ,f7 f15 + ,f29 f29 /]
```

In this feature set:

- Retain transformations such as `f7 sqrt` and `f7 tanh`, as non-linear transformations can capture complex patterns.
- Use `f15 f7 - minmax_scaler` and `f7 minmax_scaler` for normalization, ensuring features are scaled to a similar range for better comparison.
- Include `f29 cube` to emphasize larger differences in values due to the power transformation.
- Add new feature interactions such as `f7 f15 +` and `f29 f29 /` to capture explicit relationships between inputs.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:05:00,644 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the provided examples, we will aim to create interactions between features using mathematical operations, transformations, scaling, and non-linear transformations that are known to capture complex patterns. Here's a new feature set example, taking inspiration from both provided sets:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f7 sqrt, f29 cos, f15 tanh, f7 f29 * log, f15 reciprocal, f7 f15 + cube, f29 square, f7 stand_scaler, f29 f7 + minmax_scaler, f7 f29 / sigmoid]
```

This feature set includes non-linear transformations such as `sqrt`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `log`, which can help uncover complex relationships in the data. The combination operations (`*`, `+`, `/`) are used to create interactions between different features, and scaling techniques (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) are used to normalize the data range, potentially making it more suitable for certain classification algorithms.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:05:09,914 - INFO - llm output = To improve these feature sets, we can incorporate transformations that might enhance the predictive power of the features, as well as interactions between features. Here is a new feature set incorporating these ideas:

This feature set attempts to create potentially useful new features by:

1. Utilizing fundamental transformation operations (sqrt, square, log, etc.) to scale and distill information in variables.
2. Demonstrating feature interactions like sums, products, divisions, and differences that might suggest relational patterns.
3. Introducing advanced transformations (cube, reciprocal) that can capture non-linear relationships.
4. Exploring complex combinations to uncover hidden signals in the data.

This approach hopes to harness both the linear and non-linear dynamics inherent in the dataset for improved feature robustness and downstream task accuracy.

- `f1 log`: Applying the logarithm transformation to `f1` can help normalize its distribution and capture multiplicative relationships.
- `f34 reciprocal`: Using the reciprocal transformation on `f34` can emphasize the influence of smaller values and inverse relationships.
- `f18 f32 /`: Creating a new feature by dividing `f18` by `f32` may enable the model to capture the relationship between these two attributes, potentially highlighting trends or interactions relevant for classification.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:05:20,499 - INFO - llm output = To create a new, improved feature set, we can take inspiration from the two previous examples. We will aim to incorporate diverse operations that capture non-linear transformations and interactions between features. Here's the proposed new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f15 cos ,f29 sin ,f7 tanh ,f7 f15 * sqrt ,f7 square ,f29 f7 * minmax_scaler ,f29 f15 + sin ,f7 reciprocal ,f7 f29 / log ,f19 tanh ,f11 f19 * stand_scaler ,f12 f27 + reciprocal ,f33 cube ,f8 f18 / sigmoid]
```

Let's break down the additions and improvements made:
- **`f7 f29 / log`**: This feature captures the logarithm of the division of two features, which could reveal multiplicative relationships.
- **`f19 tanh`**: Applying the tanh function to `f19` introduces a non-linear transformation, which could help in capturing bounded behavior.
- **`f11 f19 * stand_scaler`**: Multiplies `f11` and `f19`, offering a new interaction term before scaling it with standard scaling. 
- **`f12 f27 + reciprocal`**: Adds two features and then applies the reciprocal function. This transformation can handle non-linear relationships.
- **`f33 cube`**: Cubes feature `f33`, adding a stronger non-linear transformation which could be beneficial if the relationship is curvilinear.
- **`f8 f18 / sigmoid`**: Divides `f8` by `f18` and then applies a sigmoid function, a common activation function which maps values to the [0,1] range, capturing bounded behavior.

These transformations could boost the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data set, resulting in better predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this set, I've replaced the `log` transformation with `minmax_scaler`, which might help stabilize the distribution and ensure all transformed values fall within a similar range, potentially aiding in prediction tasks. Additionally, I replaced the `sin` transformation of `f22` with `cos` to provide a complementary trigonometric feature perspective.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f15 cos ,f29 sin ,f7 tanh ,f7 f15 * sqrt ,f7 square ,f29 f7 * minmax_scaler ,f29 f15 + sin ,f7 reciprocal ,f15 f29 / log ,f7 f29 f15 * + cube ,f35 f9 * tanh ,f0 f40 / sqrt]

2026-01-12 15:05:30,937 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the examples provided, the goal is to ensure diverse transformations that may capture non-linear relationships in your dataset. Here's a new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f7 sin ,f15 cos ,f7 tanh ,f29 sin ,f29 f7 * ,f29 f40 * stand_scaler ,f7 f29 + minmax_scaler ,f15 f29 * sqrt ,f29 f7 f15 + sigmoid ,f12 cube ,f8 reciprocal ,f0 f1 * tanh]
```

This new feature set introduces additional scaling, transformation, and interaction terms. It includes operations like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `sigmoid` that can help in normalizing or capturing complex relationships between features. The use of `cube`, `reciprocal`, and new interaction terms (e.g., `f29 f40 * stand_scaler`) can also enhance the modeling capabilities by capturing more intricate patterns in your data.
