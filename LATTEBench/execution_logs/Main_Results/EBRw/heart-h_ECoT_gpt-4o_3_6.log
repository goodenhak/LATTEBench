2026-01-13 11:13:38,397 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples of feature sets, a better feature set would likely take favorable elements from both examples. The first example leverages a variety of feature transformations, such as min-max scaling, square root, and sine operations, whereas the second example utilizes standard scaling and reciprocal transformations. To improve upon these:

1. Utilize scalers to normalize features, helping in cases where scaling impacts model performance.
2. Use mathematical transformations like reciprocals and square roots for non-linear relationships.
3. Apply trigonometrical transformations which may reveal periodic-like patterns.
4. Construct interaction terms or ratios relevant to the problem domain.

Here's an enhanced feature set combining these strategies:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f4 stand_scaler ,f0 stand_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f1 reciprocal ,f9 reciprocal ,f9 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f2 f7 / ,f3 f7 / ,f4 sqrt f7 / ,f5 stand_scaler f7 / ,f6 stand_scaler f7 / ,f8 sqrt f7 / ,f9 sqrt f7 / ,f10 sqrt f7 / ,f10 minmax_scaler sin ,f11 minmax_scaler cos ,f4 reciprocal tanh ,f12 stand_scaler sigmoid ,f5 stand_scaler inverse]
```

This proposed feature set retains useful transformations from the original examples (e.g., scaling, reciprocal) while integrating additional transformations, like reciprocal transformations and trigonometric functions, for a potentially richer representation of the data that may help in predicting heart disease more accurately.

Let's consider creating interactions between existing features and scaling or non-linear transformations that could capture complex relationships:

1. Include a logarithm transformation of features that tend to be exponential or skewed.
2. Include feature interactions to capture dependencies between features.
3. Utilize scalers to bring features to the same scale.

2026-01-13 11:13:57,024 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! When considering the two feature sets provided, let's aim to create a more efficient and potentially informative feature set by simplifying operations and incorporating transformations that may capture non-linear relationships, while also reducing the feature count for simplicity and interpretability.

Here is a new feature set derived from the two examples provided:

```
[f9 f1 * quan_trans ,f10 f8 f4 - f2 f4 - / * sin ,f9 f1 * quan_trans sin ,f9 f8 f4 - f10 f4 - / * f2 f4 - f8 f4 - / / ,f10 f9 f4 - f9 f4 - / * f9 f4 - f2 f4 - / / sin ,f10 f8 f4 - f2 f4 - / * sin]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`f9 f1 * quan_trans`**: A quantile transformation of the product of two features, capturing distributional properties.
2. **`f10 f8 f4 - f2 f4 - / * sin`**: Using the sine transformation to capture potential periodicity or non-linearities.
3. **`f9 f1 * quan_trans sin`**: Further transformation on `quan_trans` output using sine for capturing additional non-linearity.
4. **`f9 f8 f4 - f10 f4 - / * f2 f4 - f8 f4 - / /`**: Keeps the multiplicative interactions considering differences, potentially useful for interacting features.
5. **`f10 f9 f4 - f9 f4 - / * f9 f4 - f2 f4 - / / sin`**: Emphasizes nonlinear interactions where sine periodicity may benefit.
6. **`f10 f8 f4 - f2 f4 - / * sin`**: A simpler interaction which uses sine to capture nonlinear relationships with fewer transformations.

In this new feature set, operations and transformations that add non-linearity while also being interpretable are employed. The use of sine and quantile transformation helps in capturing underlying patterns which might not be visible with simple transformations.

[f0 ,f2 ,f4 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f2 f4 - ,f8 f4 - ,f9 f4 - ,f12 f4 - ,f1 f4 - cos ,f2 f4 - cos ,f4 f2 f4 - - ,f4 f8 f4 - - ,f4 f9 f4 - - ,f4 f10 f4 - - ,f7 cos ,f7 f2 * ,f7 f8 * ,f7 f9 * ,f7 f10 * ,f7 f12 f4 - cos * ,f7 f4 f2 f4 - - * ,f7 f4 f5 f4 - - * ,f7 f4 f11 f4 - - * ,f7 f7 cos * ,f7 f8 * ,f7 f9 * ,f7 f10 * ,f9 f4 - log ,f8 f7 * sin ,f2 f7 tanh * ,f10 log]
```

**Key improvements:**

1. **Expanded Cross-Feature Interactions:** 
   - Additional interactions such as `f7 f8 *` and `f7 f9 *` to capture effects of `chest_pain` multiplied with other features like `thalach` and `oldpeak`.

2. **Non-linear Transformations:** 
   - Introduced `log` transformations like `f9 f4 - log` for features involving differences that might have exponential relationships (e.g., features minus age).
   - Incorporated `sin` functions to create potential periodic patterns with `f8 f7 * sin` which could be useful if certain heart conditions manifest in cyclical patterns.
   - Utilized `tanh` for transformations like `f2 f7 tanh *`, tapping into rescaled sigmoid-like behavior.

3. **Feature Scaling and Normalization:**
   - Continued using cosine transformations which can help map input values into a -1 to 1 range, potentially improving model convergence.

These transformations aim to extract deeper patterns and behaviors from the dataset that are not immediately obvious from linear or individual feature analysis. This set offers a mixture of direct mappings, feature interactions, and nonlinear adjustments that could lead to better predictive insights when applied in the context of modeling heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-13 11:14:25,448 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for predicting the presence of heart disease, we can incorporate more sophisticated transformations that may capture underlying patterns better. Here's a new feature set that attempts to utilize diverse transformations and interactions:

- Added log transformation for f10 and f3 to handle skewness and potentially reveal multiplicative relationships.
- Introduced reciprocal transformation on the interaction between f9 and f8 to emphasize smaller differences which may have high impact in certain scenarios.

These additions help to explore the data space more effectively and could capture nuanced relationships between features that might be indicative of heart disease presence.

2026-01-13 11:14:29,452 - INFO - llm output = Creating a better feature set involves generating features that capture more predictive power or help improve model interpretability. Let's try combining transformations and operations strategically:

1. Employ transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and scaling methods to help normalize features and capture non-linear relationships.
2. Combine the differences between features and apply transformations to capture relative changes.
3. Use combinations that can introduce interactions between different features.

Let's create a new feature set based on the provided feature sets:

[f2, f9, f10, f8 f3 -, f9 f7 -, f10 f7 -, f8 f3 - sqrt, f9 f7 - sqrt, f10 f7 - sqrt, f8 f7 - f9 f7 - sqrt, f8 f7 - f10 f7 - sqrt, f9 f7 - f8 f7 - sqrt, f10 f7 - f8 f7 - sqrt, f2 log, f9 log, f10 log, f8 f3 - log, f9 f7 - log, f10 f7 - log, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f8 f3 - reciprocal, f9 f7 - reciprocal, f10 f7 - reciprocal, f8 f3 sqrt f8 f3 sqrt * f10 *, f9 f7 sqrt f9 f7 sqrt * f10 *, f10 tanh, f2 sigmoid, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 stand_scaler]

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a breakdown of some transformation logic I am applying above:

- The integration of `sinh` and `cos` functions aims to explore non-linear relationships that could capture complex interactions.
- The complex expressions involving `sin`, `sinh`, and `stand_scaler` aim to normalize and possibly de-correlate highly interactive features like `thalach` and `trestbps`.
- I have refrained from excessive repetition seen in previous sets, maintaining clarity and relevance for features.
- The use of simplistic operations (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) where applicable, helps standardize feature values effectively, reducing potential biases from magnitude differences.

Please let me know if you'd like further refinement or any specific transformation applied!

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:14:57,812 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we need to preserve useful features while making it more enriched by adding transformations or combining features. Let's build a new feature set with the given operations and attempt to improve it.

Here's a new feature set:

[f2 ,f9 ,f10 ,f8 f3 - ,f9 f7 - ,f10 f3 - ,f8 f7 - f2 / ,f9 f7 - f2 / ,f10 f7 - f2 / ,f8 f7 - f9 f7 - * ,f8 f7 - f10 f7 - * ,f9 f7 - f8 f7 - * ,f9 f7 - f10 f7 - * ,f10 f7 - f8 f7 - * ,f10 f7 - f9 f7 - * ,f2 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f9 f7 - minmax_scaler ,f10 f3 - minmax_scaler ,f8 f3 - quan_trans]

Here are the changes:
1. Added division of f2 by the differences between f8, f9, f10, and f7 to generate normalized features related to a specific metric (f2). This introduces a scaling factor useful in regression models.
2. Introduced `minmax_scaler` on `f9 f7 -` and `f10 f3 -` to scale these differences into a range between 0 and 1, which can help with model convergence.
3. Preserved valuable transformations such as square root and quantile transformation.

With these modifications, the feature set becomes more comprehensive and potentially more useful for heart disease prediction.

- Added transformations such as `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to ensure scaled features for better stability in models.
- Combined different features while including some key operations which might reveal nonlinear interactions present in the data.
- Maintained the format and extended these transformations with more combinations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The new feature set applies additional transformations like `log`, `square`, `cube`, `reciprocal`, and interactions between different features, which could potentially capture more complex relationships to improve predictive performance for heart disease presence.

Here's a proposed enhanced feature set:

```

Explanation:

1. **Quantile Transformation**: This operation remains valuable for handling non-normal distributions, ensuring that the features are transformed to follow a uniform distribution.

2. **Feature Interactions**:
   - Interaction terms involving `f7` (exang) with `f4` (chol) and some others (`f6` and `f5`) have been selected, hypothesizing that exercise-induced angina might synergize with cholesterol levels and other features in meaningful ways.
   - Interaction terms involving `f4` (chol) with `f8` (oldpeak) and `f10` (slope) have been considered, as these could mark significant changes during exercise.
   - Calculating ratios and products like `f0 f1 /` (age to sex ratio), `f1 f3 *` (sex with trestbps) and `f2 f10 *` (chest pain with slope) might uncover underlying patterns related to heart disease risk, while reducing potential collinearity.

3. **Feature Transformation**:
   - `f7 f4 - sqrt` might capture non-linear relationships, especially in terms of deviation from typical cholesterol levels against exercise-induced symptoms.

These choices are intended to blend quantitative transformation with meaningful feature engineering to potentially heighten predictive performance for heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this improved feature set:
- Both `quan_trans` and `sin` functions are prioritized to ensure proper scaling and non-linear transformation of the features.
- `sqrt` is applied to ease interpretation and prevent potential issues tied to extreme values.
- Interaction of features involves both multiplicative and subtractive operations, which can help in revealing relationships between them.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:15:35,904 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets provided, and considering the downstream task of predicting heart disease presence, it is important to produce engineered features that capture potentially complex interactions and transformations of the input space while minimizing complexity and redundancy. A useful feature set will involve meaningful transformations that can potentially highlight patterns in the data that are not obvious with raw features. Here's a suggested feature set derived from your two existing ones:

[f3 f8 * f3 f2 * - f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - - , f3 f8 sin * f7 f2 * - f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - - quan_trans , f3 f8 * f3 f2 * - f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - - quan_trans , f3 f8 * f7 f2 * - f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - - , f3 f8 sin * f7 f2 * - f7 f2 sin * f7 f2 * - - quan_trans , f7 f8 * f7 f2 * - f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - - , f3 f8 * f7 f2 * - f3 f2 sin * f7 f2 * - - , f7 f2 sin * f7 f2 * - f3 f8 * f7 f2 * - - quan_trans , f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - f3 f8 * f3 f2 * - - quan_trans , f3 f2 sin * f7 f2 * - f3 f8 * f7 f2 * - - quan_trans]

In this set, we have focused on some of the interactions that could capture non-linear relationships between features likely related to the target, including sin transformations and measuring interactions through multiplication. We also included a few transformations applied through quantile transformations to facilitate establishment of potential patterns in non-linear ways. Note that we have simplified some of the terms to reduce redundancy and improve computational efficiency.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:15:41,087 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets examples, the aim is to enhance the interpretability and predictive power of the feature by identifying useful and effective transformations. When comparing feature sets, it's beneficial to use operations that expand the dimensionality or provide non-linear transformations while maintaining computational efficiency and relevance to the prediction task. Here is an improved feature set based on the examples:

```plaintext
[f3 f8 * f3 f2 * - f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - f3 f8 * f7 f2 * - - quan_trans - f3 f8 * f3 f2 * - f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - f3 f8 * f7 f2 * - - quan_trans - f3 f2 sin * f3 f2 * - f3 f8 cube * f7 f2 * - + - f3 f2 sin * f7 f2 * reciprocal f3 f8 * f7 f2 * - - sigmoid -]
```

This feature set incorporates:

1. **Cubing**: Complex non-linear transformation for capturing interactions between features (i.e., `f3 f8 cube * f7 f2 * -`).
2. **Reciprocal and Sinusoidal functions**: Enhances non-linear relationships crucial in medical data.
3. **Sigmoid transformation**: An essential transformation for normalizing data, especially binary outcomes like disease presence.
4. **Combinations of negative and positive interactions**: To capture potential inverse relationships and interactions effectively.

These operations collectively form a more articulate feature set, serving both predictive accuracy and feature inspection purposes.

In this improved feature set, the following operations are added to capture nonlinear relationships and scale features:

- Added `tanh` transformation for f2, f3, and f4 to handle nonlinear dependencies that might be present in the data.
- Used division (/) and `stand_scaler` operation between f5 and f6 to explore the balance and standardized scaling of these features.
- Applied `minmax_scaler` on f6 to ensure it fits within a 0-1 range, making comparisons more intuitive.
- Included a `log` transformation of f3, further multiplied by f4 to capture multiplicative logarithmic effects.

Here's the proposed improved feature set:

- **Adding Initial Features**: Include f2, f9, f10 for direct usage.
  
- **Enhancing Differences**: Include features like \( f2 \sqrt, f9 \sqrt, f10 \sqrt \) to emphasize direct transformation effects.
  
- **Creating Interaction Terms**: They tend to help in understanding the importance of interaction between features.
  
- **Advanced Transformations**: Use transformations like min-max scaling, quantile transformations, and square root to help in normalizing and revealing distribution patterns:
  
  ```  
  [f2 ,f9 ,f10 ,f9 f7 - ,f10 f3 - ,f8 f7 - ,f9 f7 - f10 f7 - * ,f8 f7 - f10 f7 - * ,f9 f7 - f9 f7 - * cube ,f8 f7 - f9 f7 - * sqrt ,f9 f7 - f8 f7 - * sqrt ,f10 f7 - f8 f7 - * sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f8 f7 - reciprocal ,f8 f7 - f8 f7 - * sqrt ,f8 f7 - f9 f7 - * sqrt ,f9 f7 - f8 f7 - minmax_scaler ,f9 f7 - f9 f7 - minmax_scaler ,f8 f7 - cube ,f10 f3 - quan_trans ,f8 f3 - quan_trans ,f9 f7 - f2 sqrt ,f10 f7 - f2 sqrt]
  ```

### Explanation
- **Feature Selection**: Keeping initial features might help retain their individual importance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhancing differences and interaction between-key features might expose underlying patterns significant for heart disease predictions.
- **Transformations**: Advanced transformations like cube, sqrt, and reciprocal help harness non-linear characteristics of data, while scaling and quantile transformations standardize distribution shifts.
- **Interaction Enhancements**: Exposing interactions through complex transformations can surface insightful patterns.

By using a combination of transformations and interactions, this feature set aims to enhance signal extraction and predictive performance in heart disease presence determination.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

This new feature set introduces additional complexity by combining multiple transformations like `cos`, `cube`, `sqrt`, and `tanh` with existing ones for potentially better discrimination and handling of non-linearity in the data. It also uses multiple operations between features to encourage interaction effects in the modeling process.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:16:10,776 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, we aim to generate a new feature set that effectively utilizes mathematical operations to derive features that capture potential relationships or interactions within the data, potentially enhancing prediction accuracy.

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f2 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f1 f3 f4 + * ,f2 f7 f9 * sqrt ,f8 f7 f3 - log ,f9 f3 f4 * reciprocal ,f10 f3 f7 - tanh ,f2 f9 + f10 cube ,f8 f9 * sqrt ,f1 f3 f7 - f4 sigmoïd ,f7 f8 f9 * log ,f10 f9 f4 / minmax_scaler ,f2 f4 * f9 sigmoid ,f8 f3 f4 - stand_scaler ,f9 f7 cosine ,f10 f7 cube ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler]
```

Let me breakdown the logic behind some of these choices:

1. **Combination of existing features with operations** such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and application of nonlinear functions like `sigmoid` and `log`, which can help capture nonlinear interactions between features.

2. **Feature transformations using statistical scaling** (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`), which help normalize and adjust ranges, improving the input data quality for certain types of machine learning models.

3. **Use of functions that capture complex relationships** like tanh and cube, which might reveal higher-order feature interactions not immediately apparent with basic arithmetic operations.

4. **Square root and reciprocal transformations**, included to handle range and spread of values, potentially transforming extreme values and distributions to improve model sensitivity and stability. 

Remember to evaluate the performance improvement or take A/B testing approach to decide the best transformed feature set before deploying in practice.

2026-01-13 11:16:16,489 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by building on the previous two examples, I'll consider the following principles: 

1. **Diverse Transformations**: Include a mix of mathematical transformations and interaction terms.
2. **Address Missing Values**: Handle potential issues arising from missing values.
3. **Statistical Scaling**: Ensure transformed features are not overly skewed or have extreme ranges.

Given these considerations, here's an improved feature set:

```
[f2 , f9 , f10 , f2 f9 + , f10 f3 - , f10 f7 - , f8 f7 - f9 f7 - * , f8 f7 - f10 f7 - * , f9 f7 - f8 f7 - * , f9 f7 - f10 f7 - * , f2 sqrt , f9 sqrt , f10 sqrt , f9 f7 - f9 f7 - * sqrt , f9 f7 - f10 f7 - * sqrt , f2 f9 * , f2 f10 * , f9 f10 * , f8 f7 - quan_trans , f10 f3 - quan_trans]
```

### Explanation:

- **Basic Features**: Retained `f2`, `f9`, and `f10` as base features.
- **Addition and Subtraction**: Added `f2 f9 +` to capture potential linear interactions. The subtraction terms like `f10 f3 -` and `f10 f7 -` capture differences, which might help highlight disparities related to heart disease.
- **Interactions**: Terms like `f8 f7 - f9 f7 - *` and similar include higher-order interactions that could capture more complex relationships.
- **Square Roots**: Using `sqrt`, we stabilize variance for these features.
- **Multiplication for Interaction**: `f2 f9 *`, `f2 f10 *`, `f9 f10 *` help to create interaction terms that can capture more complex relationships between features.
- **Statistical Transformations**: Applied `quan_trans` (quantile transformation) to reduce the skew of differences, adapting them to a normal distribution. 

This feature set retains diverse interactions and transformations, addressing missing values indirectly via feature engineering, and implements statistical scaling techniques.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Key Improvements:
- Incorporate standard scaling (stand_scaler) to standardize features with mean 0 and variance 1.
- Use quantile transformations (quantile_trans) to map features to a uniform distribution, improving robustness against outliers.
- Apply log and reciprocal transformations to handle skewness in data.
- Use square root and cube transformations for variety in mathematical derivations.
- Apply operations like sinh and sin for non-linear transformations that might capture intricate patterns.
- Include some conventional arithmetic transformations while ensuring numerical safety by placing potential zeros in the denominator.
  
This new feature set should offer diversified transformations and encapsulate various data scaling and mapping strategies, aiding in potentially increasing the predictive power and model performance.

2026-01-13 11:16:41,867 - INFO - llm output = Given the two new feature sets, the goal is to create a better feature set from them. To improve predictions, it's helpful to incorporate transformations that capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. Here's a new feature set combining elements from the provided feature sets to optimize predictive potential:

```

```

Adjustments made:
- Enhanced interaction terms between f2 and other transformed features to capture complex relationships.
- Incorporated both linear and non-linear transformations (e.g., `sin`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`) to exploit diverse aspects of the data.
- Added product terms involving `sin` transformation to model periodic behavior, potentially useful if any periodic patterns exist in the physiological data.
- Combined features using arithmetic operations (+, *) to enhance interactions and data depth.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This set combines various transformations such as sin, cube, and reciprocal operations and integrates scaling techniques like standard and quantile transformation. This should provide enhanced feature interactions and improved normalization, potentially yielding better predictive accuracy for heart disease presence.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

In this improved feature set, new interactions and transformations are added:

- `f0 f7 / stand_scaler`: Ratio of max heart rate achieved to age, standardized.
- `f1 f3 * log`: Log transformation of the product of sex and resting blood pressure, potentially capturing a non-linear relationship.
- `f5 f12 + reciprocal`: Reciprocal transformation after adding fasting blood sugar and thal, which could reveal the importance of their interaction.
- `f4 f8 - sigmoid`: Applying the sigmoid function to the difference between cholesterol and exercise-induced angina, capturing non-linear effects.
- `f2 f11 * minmax_scaler`: Scale the product of chest pain type and number of major vessels, highlighting interactions.
- `f6 f0 - f7 * sqrt quan_trans`: Quantile transformation of the square root of the interaction between resting electrocardiographic results and a combination of age and maximum heart rate achieved.

These transformations and interactions are intended to extract meaningful patterns and improve the predictive power of the model.

2026-01-13 11:17:07,325 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions, we can enhance the feature set by introducing additional transformations and combining features strategically. Here's one such improved feature set example:

[f0, f1, f2, f4, f7, f8, f9, f10, f2 f4 - ,f8 f4 - ,f9 f4 - ,f12 f4 - ,f1 f4 - cos ,f2 f4 - cos ,f4 f2 f4 - - ,f4 f8 f4 - - ,f4 f9 f4 - - ,f4 f10 f4 - - ,f7 cos ,f7 f2 * ,f7 f8 * ,f7 f9 * ,f7 f10 * ,f7 f2 f4 - cos * ,f7 f12 f4 - cos * ,f7 f4 f2 f4 - - * ,f7 f4 f5 f4 - - * ,f7 f4 f11 f4 - - * ,f7 f7 cos * , f4 f8 - cos , f0 f1 - tanh, f2 f4 * reciprocal, f7 f8 / log, f10 square] 

This extended feature set introduces a few additional transformations:

1. `f4 f8 - cos`: This combines the difference between features `f4` and `f8` with the cosine transformation to potentially capture non-linear relationships.

2. `f0 f1 - tanh`: This explores the effect of the difference between `f0` and `f1` through a tanh activation function, which can be useful in handling non-linearities.

3. `f2 f4 * reciprocal`: This multiplies `f2` and `f4` and applies the reciprocal transformation, potentially amplifying effects of small values and capturing interaction effects.

4. `f7 f8 / log`: Dividing `f7` by `f8` followed by a logarithmic transformation helps manage skewness or compress outliers more effectively.

5. `f10 square`: Squaring `f10` can help emphasize its effect if it's particularly important for prediction. 

These transformations provide additional non-linear features to help improve the model's ability to capture complex patterns related to heart disease presence.

2026-01-13 11:17:14,092 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set from the given two examples using postfix (Reverse Polish) notation, we should focus on incorporating a mix of basic statistical transformations alongside non-linear transformations like trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Additionally, combining features through arithmetic operations is useful for capturing interactions between features. The second example seems to be an improvement over the first, as it offers a variety of transformations and combinations.

Here is the improved feature set, combining concepts from both examples and adding some extra transformations:

```
[f2, f4, f7, f8, f9, f10, f2 f4 -, f8 f4 -, f9 f4 -, f4 f8 f4 - -, f4 f9 f4 - -, f4 f10 f4 - -, f7 cos, f7 f2 *, f7 f8 *, f7 f9 *, f7 f10 *, f7 f2 f4 - cos *, f2 f4 - cos cos, f4 f8 f4 - - cos, f4 f9 f4 - - cos, f7 f4 f5 f4 - - * cos, f7 f4 f11 f4 - - * cos, f7 f7 cos * cos, f7 f8 * cos, f2 cos, f8 cos, f9 cos, f10 cos, f7 sin, f7 tanh, f8 f4 - sin, f9 f2 /, f4 sqrt, f9 reciprocal, f10 log, f2 f7 f8 * +, f7 f8 f9 + *, f4 f9 f10 + tanh *]
```

In this improved feature set:
- We have retained useful transformations from the examples, particularly using arithmetic operations to capture feature interactions.
- Additional transformations like `sin`, `tanh`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, and `log` functions are introduced, as they can reveal non-linear relationships in the data.
- By using expressions like `f2 f7 f8 * +`, we are testing interactions between multiple features, which can be significant for prediction tasks.
- Notice that added transformations can help in handling outliers (`log`, `tanh`) and scaling effects (`reciprocal`, `sqrt`) which can be useful given the varied scales and ranges of original features.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
1. I retained the original set of features `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12]`.
2. Included quantile transformations, as it appeared in both examples, can help handle non-linear relationships and ensure feature distribution aligns better with the target variable.
3. Retained specific interactions and transformations like `(f3 f7 -)` and `(f8 f7 - f8 f7 - * sqrt)` from the first feature set example, which focuses on nuanced interactions that might be critical in capturing certain patient characteristics.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set builds upon transformations seen in the examples to generate new features that are likely more informative for predicting heart disease presence. The inclusion of transformations such as `sin`, `minmax_scaler`, and combinations with multiplications is aimed at capturing potential non-linear relationships and scaling, benefiting the downstream task.
