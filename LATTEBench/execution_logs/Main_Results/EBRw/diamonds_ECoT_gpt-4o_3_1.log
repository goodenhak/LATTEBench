Explanation:

1. Introduced the use of `stand_scaler` to scale features given the importance of normalization in model performance.
2. Added combinations using `reciprocal`, which can transform features and capture potentially hidden relationships due to its non-linear nature.
3. Incorporated mathematical operations `+` and `-` with scaled features to enhance complexity while maintaining interpretability.
4. Selected the best components from both examples to expand on robust transformations like `cos` and `stand_scaler`, ensuring diverse coverage of data characteristics.

2026-01-13 15:59:57,099 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, it appears that you're looking to achieve a balance between feature transformation and the use of non-linear transformations and scaling techniques. The second feature set demonstrates a more diverse use of transformations, including `quan_trans`, `sin`, and `cos`, to adjust the features to potentially better capture non-linear relationships. To enhance this feature set further, I'll incorporate additional operations such as `log`, `cube`, and `minmax_scaler`, which might contribute positively to the prediction model's performance due to their ability to normalize and expand the feature space. Here's a new feature set:

```

This feature set includes:

- The introduction of `log` transformation on several features to handle skewness and potentially improve linear relationships.
- Use of `cube` on select transformed features to introduce higher-order interactions.
- The use of `minmax_scaler` to normalize the range of the features, particularly useful for features intended to be used by algorithms sensitive to feature scale.
- Added `reciprocal`, which can help emphasize the differences where feature values are very small.

Explanation of some transformations:
- `f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8`: Original features.
- `f0 log ,f4 log`: Log transformation to reduce skewness.
- `f0 square ,f6 square ,f8 square`: Squaring to capture non-linearity, especially for `carat`, `x`, and `z`.
- `f0 f6 * ,f0 f7 *`: Interaction terms to capture relationships between the features.
- `f1 f4 * , f2 f5 *`: More interaction terms for categorical and numerical data.
- `f0 log f4 log *`: Interaction between log-transformed features, exploiting multiplicative scales.
- `f6 f8 / ,f6 f8 *`: Ratio and product to capture the relationships between dimensions.
- `f5 sqrt`: Transformation to address outliers, especially for `table`.
- `f0 f7 * f8 *`: Complex interaction term for capturing higher-order interactions.

Transformations are chosen to maintain variability and capture complex interaction patterns that can enhance model learning, considering both non-linear patterns and potential interactions among the features.

### Explanation of New Features:

1. **Basic Transformations**:
   - `f0 log`, `f0 sqrt`, `f3 log`, `f6 sqrt` utilize logarithmic and square root transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
  
2. **Nested Transformations**:
   - `f0 sqrt sqrt`, `f6 sqrt sqrt`, `f0 sqrt log log`, `f6 sqrt log log` apply transformations iteratively to accommodate more complex non-linear dynamics.
  
3. **Standard Scaling and Min-Max Scaling**:
   - `f3 minmax_scaler`, `f6 sqrt log stand_scaler` help adjust the scale of the features for better integration and compatibility with machine learning models.
  
4. **Trigonometric Transformations**:
   - `f1 sin`, `f2 cos` expose periodic patterns and interactions related to the features.
  
5. **Mathematical Interactions**:
   - `f0 f1 -`, `f8 f7 /`, `f6 f3 -` allow for understanding interactions and differences between features, which may have meaningful correlations with the target variable.

6. **Non-Linear Transformations**:
   - `f4 tanh` captures non-linear transformation resembling an S-curve useful for bounded transformations.

By blending these diverse transformations, the new feature set is designed to better capture the intricate relationships present in the data, which could potentially enhance the predictive performance of models trained using this new feature set.

2026-01-13 16:06:15,478 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided and the task of improving predictions of diamond prices, I will generate a new feature set. This new set will take inspiration from the transformations used in both examples, incorporating various scaling, transformation, and interaction techniques to potentially capture complex relationships within the data.

Here's a suggested improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, 
 f0 log, f1 log, f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f5 log, f6 log, f7 log, f8 log,

 f0 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler,
 f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f6 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal]
```

### Explanation:
- **Log Transformations:** Applied to all features to reduce skewness.
- **Square and Cube Transformations:** These can help model polynomial relationships, especially given the non-linear nature of the diamond pricing.
- **Interaction Terms:** Product of pairs of features to capture potential interactions between variables, which can be insightful in complex datasets.
- **Min-Max Scaling:** Particularly useful for features with different units or scales to normalize the data.
- **Reciprocal Transformations:** Useful to handle skewness, especially when there are very large or small values.

This approach combines direct transformations of individual features, polynomial transformations, and interaction terms, potentially capturing both linear and non-linear relationships that can improve model performance in predicting diamond prices.

The latter example you provided already includes numerous transformations, particularly focusing on non-linear combinations and operations with features. We will build on that by introducing additional operations that might reveal underlying patterns or relationships between features. Here is a suggested improved feature transformation set:

```

```

Here's the explanation for some of the new transformations:

- **`f0 f4 + sqrt`**: Takes the square root of the sum of `f0` and `f4`, potentially capturing non-linear relationships.
- **`f0 log`**: Applies the logarithm transformation to `f0`, which can help in handling skewed data and revealing multiplicative relationships.
- **`f1 f5 *`**: Multiplies `f1` and `f5`, combining the influence of two categorical transformations.
- **`f3 f6 /`**: Divides `f3` by `f6`, capturing potential interactions between `f3` and `f6`.
- **`f7 f8 /`**: Divides `f7` by `f8`, which might reveal interesting patterns between these two features.
- **`f4 f5 * f3 /`**: Multiplication of `f4` and `f5` divided by `f3`, which combines multiple features into a compound metric.
- **`log f4 f4 + f5 * +`**: Adds `f4` to itself, multiplies by `f5`, and takes the log, capturing logarithmic growth rates.

Additional feature scaling operations, such as `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler`, on different combinations of features can help normalize and center data, making it easier for models to pick up on patterns.

2026-01-13 16:09:17,496 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the given examples, we'll create derived features by applying transformations and combinations of the original features. The goal is to generate features that could potentially capture underlying patterns or relationships in the data that are relevant for predicting the diamond's price.

Considering the operations provided and the pattern from past examples, we can create a new feature set that includes a mix of statistical scaling, mathematical transformations, and feature interactions. Here's a proposed feature set that builds upon the provided examples:

```

```

### Explanation:

1. **Original Features (`f0, f1, ..., f8`)**: Keep all original features to maintain baseline information.

2. **Standard Scaling (`stand_scaler`)**: Apply standard scaling to some of the features which often improves model performance by making features comparable.

3. **Log Transformation (`log`)**: Apply log transformation to `f0` (carat) to reduce the skewness of the distribution, which can be useful if the distribution is not normal.

4. **Combination of Transformations**: Combine different transformations (log, standard scaling) to generate new variations of features.

5. **Quantile Transformation (`quan_trans`)**: Use quantile transformation on `f6` and `f7` to make the distribution follow a uniform or normal distribution. 

6. **Feature Interactions (`+`)**: Create new features by adding transformed versions of `f0` and `f8` to capture potential interactions.

This feature set aims to strike a balance between raw features and transformed features, leveraging a mix of mathematical, scaling, and interaction transformations to potentially enhance the predictive power of the model.

### Explanation of the Additional Features:
- `f1 f2 * f3 /`: The product of features f1 (cut) and f2 (color) divided by f3 (clarity) could capture some interaction between diamond quality factors.
- `f0 f7 f8 * +`: Represents the carat weight, added to the product of the width and depth measurements. This feature captures how carat weight and volume might jointly impact the price.
- `f0 f6 *`: Represents the carat weight multiplied by length, emphasizing the linear extent of the diamond.
- `f8 f7 /`: The depth divided by width, providing an aspect ratio that may influence the diamond's appearance and thus its price.

2026-01-13 16:13:08,917 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and transformations, we aim to create a new feature set by leveraging both basic transformations and combinations of existing features while introducing useful transformations for predictive tasks.

Here's a better feature set:

```

```

**Explanation:**

1. **f0, f1, f2, f3, f6, f7, f8**: Retaining the essential base features. These represent core attributes that strongly influence diamond pricing.

2. **f0 f4 /**, **f2 f4 /**, **f3 f4 /**, **f6 f4 /**, **f7 f4 /**, **f8 f4 /**: These features represent ratios involving the total depth percentage. The ratio transformations could reveal relationships between depth and other measures.

3. **f0 f4 / sin**, **f2 f4 / sin**, **f3 f4 / sin**, **f6 f4 / sin**, **f7 f4 / sin**, **f8 f4 / sin**: Adding these sinusoidal transformations could capture cyclical relationships or patterns that may exist.

4. **f5 log**: Log transformation of the 'table' feature, which might help to handle skewness in its distribution and highlight multiplicative relationships.

5. **f5 sqrt**: The square root transformation can be used to moderate the effect of larger values, which could help when the feature's impact might scale with its magnitude.

6. **f2 f5 *** and **f0 f5 ***: Introducing interaction terms by multiplying certain features (x, carat) with the table value, potentially uncovering compound patterns that are indicative of pricing.

This enhanced feature set balances maintaining essential features while introducing mathematical and interaction transformations that could improve predictive performance.

Here is a suggested transformation:

\[ 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f0 log, f3 log, f6 log, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f0 f3 *, f0 f6 *, f4 f7 *, f4 f8 *, f5 square, f7 square, f8 square, f0 f5 /, f3 f6 /] 
\]

### Explanation of the Transformation:

1. **Logarithmic Transformation (log):** Applied to features `f0`, `f3`, and `f6` which are numerical features. This transformation can help to manage skewness in the data and can reveal multiplicative relationships.

2. **Hyperbolic Tangent Transformation (tanh):** Applied to features `f4`, `f5`, `f7`, and `f8` to handle nonlinear relationships and stabilize variations.

3. **Multiplicative Interaction Terms (*):** Introduced terms like `f0 f3 *`, `f0 f6 *`, `f4 f7 *`, and `f4 f8 *` to capture interaction effects between different pairs of features.

4. **Square Transformation (square):** Applied to `f5`, `f7`, and `f8` to model quadratic relationships.

5. **Division to capture ratios (/):** Using `f0 f5 /` and `f3 f6 /` to capture ratio-based relationships which might correlate strongly with the target variable.

By combining these transformations, we aim to enhance the expressive power of the feature set to better capture the underlying structure of the data, potentially improving predictive performance.

2026-01-13 16:15:36,691 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature engineering examples, the goal is to transform the original features into a new set that could potentially enhance the predictive capability of a model for diamond price prediction. Each transformation aims to extract more meaningful patterns or reduce the noise present in the raw features.

Here's a new feature set, using similar techniques but attempting to improve on the previous examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f0 log, f1 log, f2 log, f6 f4 *, f7 f4 *, f8 f4 *, f0 f5 /, f1 f6 /, f2 f7 /, f3 f8 /, f5 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt]
```

Explanation:

1. **Log Transformations**: Taking the logarithm of variables can stabilize variance and make the data more closely meet the assumptions of linear models.

2. **Product with Depth (f4)**: Multiplying several features by depth could highlight volumetric considerations (e.g., weight per depth unit).

3. **Ratios**: Calculating ratios like `f0 f5 /` could highlight specific aspects like carat weight per table width.

4. **Square Roots**: Applying square roots can be particularly useful when features vary over several orders of magnitude, as it tends to dampen the impact of large outliers.

These transformations attempt to extract potentially hidden relationships and interactions in the data, which might impact the diamond's price prediction model.

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f0 log, f1 log, f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f5 log, f6 log, f7 log, f8 log, f0 f6 / log, f1 f7 * sigmoid, f2 f8 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f0 f1 tanh *, f1 f2 tanh *, f0 f2 f7 / +, f5 sqrt f6 /, f6 f7 f2 * +, f3 f8 cube, f4 reciprocal f5 sqrt *]
```

**Explanation of transformations:**

1. **Log Transform**: Applied on `f0` to `f8` to address potential skewness and emphasize multiplicative structures within the data.
2. **Division and Log**: `f0 f6 / log` transforms the ratio of two features with a log transform to capture multiplicative relationships.
3. **Sigmoid**: `f1 f7 * sigmoid` uses the sigmoid transformation to scale the interaction term into a bounded range.
4. **Square Root**: - `f2 f8 sqrt` and `f3 sqrt` help reduce right skewness.
5. **Tanh Transformation**: `f0 f1 tanh *` and `f1 f2 tanh *` are helpful for capturing saturation effects in product relationships.
6. **Complex Interactions**:
    - `f0 f2 f7 / +` combines division and addition to explore complex relationships.
    - `f6 f7 f2 * +` creates interactions between three features.
    - `f3 f8 cube` introduces cubic feature transformation for nonlinear scaling.
7. **Reciprocal and Square Root**: `f4 reciprocal f5 sqrt *` combines features inversely and reduces skewness.

The above set leverages various mathematical operations to uncover potentially complex interactions within the feature space, aiding in capturing non-linear trends and reducing multicollinearity, thus potentially improving predictive power.

2026-01-13 16:17:30,391 - INFO - llm output = To construct a better feature set based on the provided examples, we can combine the strengths of both examples and introduce transformations that can capture interactions and non-linear relationships between features. Let's work through this systematically:

1. **Keep All Original Features**: Maintain all original features, as they provide the foundational data needed for predictions.
   
2. **Ratio Features**: Compute the ratio of each feature with the `depth` feature (f4) to explore potential correlations with diamond dimensions.
   
3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Use trigonometric transformations, logarithmic, and square roots on meaningful features to capture non-linearities.

4. **Feature Scaling**: Implement min-max scaling for some features to normalize them.

5. **Higher-Order Features**: Compute higher-order terms like squares or cubes for some features to capture interaction effects.

Based on these insights, here is a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8,
 f0 f4 /, f1 f4 /, f2 f4 /, f3 f4 /, f6 f4 /, f7 f4 /, f8 f4 /,
 f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt,
 f0 * f0, f1 * f1,
 f0 f4 / sin, f1 f4 / sin, f2 f4 / sin,
 f0 f4 / cos, f1 f4 / cos, f2 f4 / cos,
 f0 log, f1 log,
 f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler,
 f0 f1 +, f0 f2 +, f0 f3 +
]
```

Here, we:
- Compute the ratio of each feature to depth.
- Apply square root, squares, sine, cosine, and logarithm transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Apply min-max scaling to `f0`, `f1`, and `f2`.
- Introduce interaction terms by summing select pairs of features. 

These transformations should give the regression model various perspectives on the data, allowing it to potentially identify more complex relationships.

Explanation:

1. The original features (`f0` to `f8`) are included for baseline predictions.
2. Multiplication operations (`f0 f4 *`, `f5 f6 *`, `f3 f8 *`) are introduced to capture interactions between relevant features that may affect the diamond price.
3. Division operations (`f0 f5 /`) help normalize or scale certain ratios between features.
4. Non-linear transformations (`f1 cos`, `f2 tanh`, `f4 sqrt`) are used to capture complex relationships that could affect price differently across the spectrum.
5. The `square` transformation on a ratio (`f0 f4 /`) is chosen to emphasize quadratic relationships for better modeling.
6. Scaling and normalization (`f6 minmax_scaler`) help ensure all features are considered fairly in prediction modeling.
7. The `reciprocal` transformation (`f7 reciprocal`) aims to address any potential skew and bring features to a more symmetric distribution.

These transformed and interaction features will potentially improve model performance by better capturing the underlying data distribution and feature relationships affecting diamond prices.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Existing Features**: 
   - Retained key existing features to maintain a base of operations similar to provided examples.
   
2. **New Transformations**:
   - **`f0 f6 * log`**: This feature computes the log of the product between two potentially influential attributes, `carat` (proxy by `f0`) and `x` (proxy by `f6`). This might help to capture multiplicative relationships.
   - **`f0 f2 / cube`**: This tries to capture the non-linear relationship by using a cube of `color` (proxy by `f2`) and dividing `carat` by this value, possibly highlighting variations linked to diamond color.
   - **`f3 f7 tanh`**: Applies the hyperbolic tangent to a difference between clarity (`f3`) and width (`f7`). Such non-linear transformations help in capturing subtle variations and normalizes the range between -1 and 1.

This feature set aims to exploit both linear and non-linear relationships, which might improve model performance when predicting diamond prices.

2026-01-13 16:26:08,244 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, the task is to transform the original features into a new set of derived features using specified operations to potentially improve the prediction model for diamond prices. The latter example seems to focus on scaling some features by `f4` (which likely represents `depth`) and retains all original features, while the former example applies a wider variety of transformations. To further enhance the feature set, let's introduce a combination of advanced scaling, interaction terms, and non-linear transformations.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f0 f4 /, f1 f4 /, f2 f4 /, f3 f4 /, f6 f4 /, f7 f4 /, f8 f4 /, f0 f1 *, f5 f3 /, f8 f3 /, f0 log, f2 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f0 f3 * f5 /, f1 f3 * f6 /, f2 f4 * f7 /, f5 minmax_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f0 f2 * sqrt, f4 f5 / log]
```

**Explanation:**
- **Scaled features:** Continuing the idea of the last example, scaling features by `f4` (possibly a crucial dimension like `depth`) remains.
- **Interaction terms:** Incorporates interactions like `f0 f1 *` (interaction of `carat` with `cut`), `f5 f3 /`, and others to capture multiplicative effects between features.
- **Non-linear transformations:** Includes logarithmic, square root transformations, and scaling via `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to deal with skewness or distribute variables more normally.
- **Complex interactions:** Combine multiple features such as `f0 f3 * f5 /` to discover more complex non-linear relationships.

This set aims to extract meaningful interactions and non-linear patterns potentially present in the data while retaining some original features for direct interpretability in modeling.

```

Explanation of the new features:

1. **Square Root Transformations:** Applied to all the original features (f0 to f8) to potentially stabilize variance and help meet assumptions of linear models.
   
2. **Multiplicative and Division Features:**
   - Product and division of various feature combinations to capture different interactions between them.
   - Specifically, f0 with f1, f3 with f6, and f4 with f7.

3. **Combination Features:**
   - Added non-linear interaction terms such as the sum of a product (f7 * f0 * f8 +) to allow capturing higher-dimensional interactions.
   - Created a complex interaction f6 f7 f8 + cube to pick up any potential polynomial relationships.

4. **Difference with Square Root Transformation:** 
   - Used difference with square root to highlight disparities among features.
   
These transformations and interactions are designed to enhance the capacity of any predictive model to learn complex patterns from the data.

Justifications for some added features:

1. **Feature Interactions:** 
   - Multiplying weight-related and dimension-related features (e.g., `f1 f6 * f5 /`) can reveal interaction effects that are not captured by individual features alone.

2. **Non-linear Transformations:**
   - Using the `tanh` and `sin` transformations on size-related ratios emphasizes nonlinear relationships.

3. **Dimension Transformation:**
   - Creating various transformations using `log`, `sqrt`, and reciprocals helps in stabilizing variance and revealing multiplicative relationships.

Each addition aims to capture different aspects of the relationships between features and the target variable, diamond price.

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Features** (`f0, f6, f7, f8`): Retained for continuity and basic interaction effects.
2. **Differences and Sigmoid Adjustments**: Continue with differences and sigmoid differences to handle scale differences and potential non-linearities.
3. **Cosine and Sigmoid Enhancements** (`f0 f6 - cos`, `f0 f3 - sigmoid`): These help model potential cyclical effects and enhance non-linearity.
4. **Log and Tanh Introductions** (`f0 f2 / log`, `f3 f8 * tanh`): 
   - `f0 f2 / log`: Logarithmic transformation of a division to handle multiplicative interactions in a non-linear manner.
   - `f3 f8 * tanh`: Tanh applied to a product for capturing interaction effects with a non-linear saturation characteristic. 

These transformations could help improve the model’s ability to capture complex, non-linear interactions between the features in predicting diamond prices.

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Features**: Retained all original features \(f0\) through \(f8\).
2. **Cosine Transformations**: Used for all numeric features, which could help capture periodic patterns or relationships.
3. **Logarithmic Transformations**: Applied to features related to carat, cut, and color (f0, f1, f2) since these might have exponential relationships with the price.
4. **Differences**: Maintained transformations \(f4 - f6\) and \(f4 - f7\) from the original feature sets to consider differences in width and depth.
5. **Products**: Created interaction terms by multiplying size-related dimensions with other features (e.g., \(f0 \times f4\), \(f1 \times f5\), \(f2 \times f6\)).
6. **Combined Product**: Calculated the combined volume or interaction of three size-related features (\(f6 \times f7 \times f8\)), which might represent a volumetric feature.

2. **Complex interactions**: Interactions such as addition and multiplication followed by transformation (e.g., cube) give a richer feature set that can capture non-linear relationships.
3. **Different scaling techniques**: Using min-max scaling for one feature to ensure that numerical feature distributions do not excessively skew model predictions.
4. **Advanced mathematical transformations**: Using `reciprocal`, `tanh`, and `sqrt` bring in a non-linear perspective to data relationships.

This set is devised to capture complex, nonlinear interactions between features that may affect diamond pricing in a way that simple linear interactions may not.

### Explanation of Additions:

1. **Cube Transformation:** 
   - Applied to `f6` and `f8` to capture the volumetric effect of these features on price.

2. **Cosine Transformation:** 
   - Applied to `f0`, `f1`, and `f3` to capture cyclical or periodic relationships that might exist but are not obvious.

3. **Square Root Transformation:** 
   - Applied to `f0`, `f2`, and `f6` to reduce skewness and handle heteroscedasticity, potentially highlighting smaller magnitude variations effectively.

4. **Log Transformation:** 
   - Applied to several ratio features (`f0 f4 /`, `f2 f4 /`, `f3 f4 /`, `f6 f4 /`, `f7 f4 /`, `f8 f4 /`) to stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed, which might help in linear model training.

Through these transformations, we are introducing non-linearity and tackling potential skewness, helping to reveal intricate hidden patterns in the data that can improve prediction tasks.

2026-01-13 16:39:41,658 - INFO - llm output = Based on the transformation patterns and general guidance on feature engineering for predictive tasks, let's aim to create a more complex and informative feature set. Here is a new feature set utilizing and extending the previous examples, with transformations aimed at potentially capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between features:

```
[f0, f6, f7, f8,

f0 f1 f2 * /, f3 f4 * sqrt, 
f6 f7 f8 * *, f4 reciprocal, 
f1 f2 + cube, f3 f7 / minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Interaction Terms**:
   - `f0 f1 f2 * /`: Represents a scaled interaction between `carat`, `x`, and `y` to capture more complex relationships.
   - `f3 f4 * sqrt`: Square root of the interaction between `clarity` and `depth` to manage potential non-linear effects.

2. **Complex Non-linear Features**:
   - `f6 f7 f8 * *`: Captures a volumetric-like property by multiplying `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - `f4 reciprocal`: Takes the reciprocal of `depth` for potential inverse relationship capture.

3. **Curvature and Rate of Change**:
   - `f1 f2 + cube`: Cubing a linear combination of `cut` and `color` could capture highly non-linear relationships.
   - `f3 f7 / minmax_scaler`: Scales the division of `clarity` and `y` to normalize potentially extreme values. 

This new feature set builds upon existing transformations, introducing non-linear relationships and higher-order interactions, which could enhance the model’s ability to capture complex patterns in the data.

**Explanation of New Additions:**
- **Square roots and logs** are added to transform original values into a linear space which can be useful for skewed distributions.
- **Composite Features:** Multiplicative interaction terms are added like `f0 f8 *`, `f1 f2 *` to capture combinations of features that might have a joint effect on the target.
- **Chained Transformations** like `f0 f1 + log` are added to provide non-linear transformations over sums of features, which often highlight interactions in a linear model.
- **Combinatorial Features:** Using both multiplication and addition (e.g., `f0 f1 f2 * * log`) helps capture higher-order interactions which are often key in complex prediction tasks.
  
These added features aim to capture non-linear relationships and potential interactions between features which are vital for improving model predictions.

- **Transformation Functions:** We are applying functions like `log`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, and scaling transformations (`stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`) to help normalize the data and make distinct feature transformations that might capture non-linear interactions.
- **Pairwise Interactions:** We've added product interactions between pairs of features to capture relationships and interactions beyond what each feature represents individually. This multiplicative feature engineering can uncover underlying patterns that contribute significantly to the prediction of the diamond price.

2026-01-13 16:47:36,840 - INFO - llm output = To improve the prediction quality for the diamond's price, let's take the latter feature set example as a base and introduce some transformations and combinations that could capture more complex interactions and refine the features even further:

Here's the explanation behind the transformations added:

1. **f0 f2 + f3 * tanh**: This combination explores the interaction between carat and depth by adding their values and multiplying by clarity. The `tanh` function will help to capture non-linear relationships.

2. **f1 f3 / log**: This transformation divides cut by clarity, exploring how cut and clarity relate to each other, while `log` helps in moderating wide variations, making the scale more interpretable.

3. **f6 f0 / cube**: This transformation investigates the interaction between x-dimension and carat, with cube capturing high-degree nonlinear interactions.

4. **f7 f8 * sqrt**: Multiplies y and z measurements, the square root helps in scaling large values, making them more manageable, and potentially revealing proportional relationships.

These transformations introduce additional non-linear interactions between features, capturing relationships potentially impactful for price prediction.

Explanation of some transformations:
- Included complex non-linear interactions like `f0 f7 f8 * + sqrt` which captures interaction between the weight and dimensions.
- Applied the `log` transformation on division to handle scale differences and skewness.
- Used `reciprocal` to enhance sensitivity to small variations in larger values.
- Continued usage of transformations like `sigmoid`, `cos`, and `quantile transform` which can reveal non-linear patterns.

In this feature set:

- We incorporate a wider range of transformations, like `cube`, `tanh`, `cos`, `sin`, and `stand_scaler`, which may help to capture nonlinear relationships and scale features appropriately.
- We enhance interaction terms by involving more features together, including combinations such as `f4 f8 + f3 /` and `f2 f0 / f4 *` to capture complex relationships between variables.
- We maintain and expand upon multiplicative interactions which are effective in modeling non-linear relationships, particularly with categorical encodings and numeric features.
- We utilize transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to normalize and standardize certain features, which can improve the model performance by making the feature scales consistent.

2. **Interactions**: Included combinations like `f0 f1 f2 * *` and `f6 f7 f8 * *` to capture interactions.
3. **Scaled Features**: Used `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` for scaling, which is useful for certain algorithms.
4. **Advanced Transformations**: Used `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cube` to introduce non-linear relationships.
5. **Mathematical Operations**: Added subtraction, addition, and division to capture relative comparisons between features.
6. **Quantile Transformation**: `quan_trans` to deal with non-normal distributions.
  
This feature set captures a wide range of interactions and transformations, providing a richer set of inputs for the prediction model.

Given the operations provided, we can combine features in a way that introduces non-linearity and interactions that are likely to correlate better with the target variable, diamond price.

Here is a newly suggested feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:
- **Original features (f0, f6, f7, f8):** These capture essential baseline characteristics of the diamonds.
- **Differences and sigmoid-scaled differences:** Features like `f0 f1 -` and `f0 f5 sigmoid -` capture variations relative to carat and scaled table width, helping to identify price-affecting discrepancies.
- **Product and ratios:** Features such as `f0 f7 f8 * +` involve interactions between dimensions and weight, which can be indicative of volume-related characteristics that typically affect price.
- **Non-linear transformations:** The new features `f0 f2 * sqrt` and `f3 f6 tanh *` introduce more complex nonlinear interactions, which can enhance model flexibility in capturing nuanced relationships.

Overall, the augmented feature set aims to capture intricate relationships and patterns in the data, which should help improve predictive performance.

Here’s a suggested postfix expression for a new feature set:

```plaintext

```

Explanation:

1. **Difference Features:** Differences such as `f0 f1 -`, `f1 f2 -`, etc., can capture deviations between carat and other features.
2. **Interaction Terms:** Multiplying carat with dimensions (`f0 f6 *`, `f0 f7 *`, `f0 f8 *`) helps in understanding how the weight interacts with the physical dimensions.
3. **Transformations:** Applying square root (`f5 sqrt`, etc.) and reciprocal (`f5 reciprocal`, etc.) gives different perspectives on skewed distributions which are common in real-world data.
4. **Inverse & Divisions:** Using inverse and divisions can also help in capturing inverse relationships and ratios which can sometimes be more informative than raw values.

The second example contains a larger set of transformed features, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and higher-order polynomials.

To construct an improved feature set, I'll build on the principles shown in the examples, incorporating a mix of transformations while ensuring a broad coverage of the different types of features. Here's a suggestion:

```

 f0 f5 f6 * *, f6 f7 f8 * *
 f0 f4 f8 * * tanh, f1 f2 f3 * * log,
 f0 f1 + log, f0 f2 f3 * * cos]
```

This set includes:

1. **Original Features**: Retain base features as they provide core information.
2. **Logarithmic Transformation**: Helps to stabilize variance and reduce skewness.
3. **Square Root Transformation**: Helps to reduce right skewness.
4. **Cosine and Tanh Transformations**: Provide non-linear transformations to capture relationships not captured by linear models.
5. **Combinations and Interactions**: Basic arithmetic operations and interactions (products, sums, and divisions) between features to capture interactions and generate potentially informative composite features.
6. **Higher-order Interactions**: Multiplications of three features followed by transformations to capture complex interactions.

These transformations aim to enrich the feature space to potentially improve the predictive power of the model. Adjustments can be made based on cross-validation results and feature importance analysis in the modeling phase.

Explanation for key choices:
- Basic operations like addition and multiplication (`+`, `*`) to explore linear relationships and feature interactions.
- Nonlinear transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, and trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tanh`) to capture non-linear relationships and periodic patterns.
- Use of functions like `sigmoid` to handle feature scaling and nonlinearity.
- Including interaction terms like `f6 f7 f8 * * sqrt` to explore higher-order interactions, which may capture complex patterns relevant for predicting diamond prices accurately.
