2026-01-12 11:22:21,874 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, here is a new feature set that combines useful transformations and techniques to potentially improve the predictive power for this task:

```

**Explanation of New Transformations:**
- **Standard Scaling** is applied to nearly all original features to normalize them and help learning algorithms handle them more effectively.
- **Log Transform** on `f1` is useful for stabilizing variance and normalizing distributions skewed to the right.
- **Quadratic and square root transformations** on `f2`, `f3`, `f9`, etc., are useful in capturing non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Trigonometric Functions** such as sine and cosine on various features add cyclic or periodic information that might be hidden in raw data.
- **Fractional transformations** like `f10 / f1` attempt to explore interactions between variables.
- **Cube Transformation** on `f8` can capture potentially complex relationships in the data.
- **Combination Features** like `f0 f1 *` might capture interactions between the two variables. Such interactions could be important, especially if not linearly correlated.

These transformations and interactions are exploratory and should be validated to ascertain their effectiveness in the predictive model.

```

In this feature set:
- I'm introducing interaction terms like `f1 f4 *` and `f9 f2 *` to capture potential multiplicative effects between pairs of features.
- The division and addition interaction `f2 f5 /` and `f5 f1 +` help to examine ratios and aggregated effects.
- Logarithm, square, cube, and square root transformations like `f11 log`, `f6 square`, `f7 cube`, and `f12 sqrt` continue to capture non-linear relationships.
- Trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations, such as `f14 tanh` and `f14 cos`, offer another level of non-linear transformation.
- Use of `sigmoid`, `reciprocal`, and `tanh` transformations to maintain complexity while introducing different scaling effects.

When considering the operations and transformations used in the previous feature sets, it's notable that the hyperbolic tangent (tanh), sine (sin), and square operations are frequently used. These operations can help in transforming the features to capture non-linear patterns. The second feature set introduces more complex transformations like repeated applications of tanh and the use of sin and square functions. To create a better feature set, we will further explore these transformations while also considering the incorporation of other operations that were not previously used, like the logarithm (log) and sigmoidal (sigmoid) transformations.

Here's a proposed enhanced feature set:

```
[f2, f7, f9, f10, f14, f2 tanh, f5 tanh, f8 tanh, f11 tanh, f14 sin, f14 tanh tanh tanh, f7 tanh tanh, f9 tanh tanh, f10 tanh tanh, f14 sin tanh, f2 tanh tanh tanh, f5 tanh tanh tanh, f8 tanh tanh tanh, f10 tanh tanh tanh, f14 log, f8 log, f9 log, f14 sin tanh tanh, f9 sin, f14 square tanh, f14 sigmoid, f2 sqrt, f14 / f9, f5 * f10 tanh, f7 tanh + f8 tanh]
```

Key modifications and considerations in this feature set:
- Introduced `f14 log`, `f8 log`, and `f9 log` to capture multiplicative relationships and dampen large values, enhancing potential interpretability for features like income.
- Used `f14 sigmoid` and `f2 sqrt` for alternative non-linear transformations.
- Combined interactions between features such as `f14 / f9` and `f5 * f10 tanh` to capture potential compound effects.
- Added arithmetic transformations like `f7 tanh + f8 tanh` to assess additive interactions between features.

These enhancements seek to exploit non-linear transformations and interactions amongst the variables to better capture the underlying patterns within the data that could indicate successful credit card applications.

I will aim to enhance the second example by incorporating complex transformations and a variety of operations that can potentially capture non-linearities or interactions that are useful for prediction.

Here is a new feature set that is constructed by combining elements from the two given examples and amplifying them with additional transformations:

Explanation of new components:
- Added `f14 sqrt` to increase the complexity and capture diminishing returns or marginal effects.
- Introduced `f14 f1 + sqrt` to explore non-linear interactions between features.
- Used `f14 log` for possible linearizing transformations or changing outcome distributions.
- Included `f14 f3 *` and `f14 f5 /` for capturing potential multiplicative and inverse relationships.
- Added `f14 f7 tanh` to capture non-linear effects using hyperbolic tangent.
- Introduced `f4 f8 f10 * +` and `f10 f12 sin +` to capture complex multiple interactions.
- Used `f13 f11 cos +` to capture periodic or cyclic patterns in feature interactions.

These modifications aim to capture a wide variety of potential relationships within the data, which could be useful for improving predictive performance.

2026-01-12 11:22:49,656 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, I'll combine the ideas from both feature sets you provided while trying to maintain computational feasibility. The goal is to design features that can potentially capture complex interactions and nonlinear relationships between the original features that could be useful for predicting credit card application success.

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f8, f1 f8 *, f2 f9 *, f8 f10 *, f7 f8 *, f8 f1 *, f8 f5 *, f8 f6 *, f8 f8 *, f8 f10 *, f10 f9 *, f9 f8 *, f10 square, f8 square, f9 square, f10 tanh, f9 cube, f8 cube, f10 square cube, f8 f10 * tanh, f6 f8 * cube, f8 f6 * cube, f8 cube cube, f10 cube cube, f8 square cube, f8 sin f10 cube -, f8 f7 sin *, f2 f8 minmax_scaler *, f0 f10 square cube cube +, f8 f9 log cube +, f8 f10 sqrt tanh, f9 square cube cosine, f14 sin f10 cube -, f14 tanh, f8 square f6 cube cube +]
```

- **Rationale:**
  - **Polynomial and interaction terms:** Features like `f1 f8 *`, `f8 f5 *`, and `f8 f10 *` allow capturing interactions between predictors, which are sometimes essential for improving predictive performance.
  - **Nonlinear transformations:** Functions like `tanh`, `cube`, `minmax_scaler`, and `sqrt` permit the model to capture non-linear relationships.
  - **Feature combinations:** Combinations such as `f8 sine`, `f0 f10 square`, or `f14 sin f10 cube -`, allow leveraging interactions that might reflect relevant real-world dynamics.
  - **Complex single-variable transformations:** Utilizing variations of existing features (e.g., `f10 square cube`, `f9 cube`, and `f8 cube cube`) transforms the data distribution, potentially making it more amenable to modeling.

Key considerations in this feature set: 
- New interactions and non-linear transformations.
- Inclusion of combined features (`f8 f10 *`, `f7 f14 *`, `f8 f14 *`, `f10 f14 *`, etc.) that potentially reflect complex relationships between original features.
- Emphasis on non-linear transformation functions like `tanh`, `sin`, and `square`.
- Use of `tanh`, `stand_scaler`, and `sin` to capture standardized and sinusoidal relationships.

```

```

Explanation:
- We include all the original features (`f0` to `f14`) to preserve the available information.
- We add interaction terms like `f2 f6 *` and `f4 f9 *` to capture potential interactions between features that might correlate with successful credit card applications.
- The term `f12 f14 *` considers the product of employment years and income, which could be a strong indicator of financial stability.
- The transformations `f14 stand_scaler` and `f14 log` on the income feature aim to normalize and reduce skewness, respectively.
- The combination `f3 f6 + f8 *` looks at the interaction between marital status, industry, and employment status, potentially revealing demographic interactions. 

This set aims to enrich the dataset with new, non-linear interactions and transformations, providing a better basis for prediction algorithms to detect patterns related to credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:
- **Squared Terms**: Maintain the squared terms from the second feature set, which help model non-linear relationships.
- **Product of Pairs**: Consider the product of some feature pairs. This can capture interactions between features that are jointly influential.
- **Ratio Features**: Implement a ratio of two features, such as `f14 f10 /`, to see the relative relationships.
- **Combined and Differential Terms**: Use combinations of differences or summations that can highlight contrasting characteristics, e.g., scattering different levels of numerical interactions.
- **Tanh Transformation**: A `tanh` transformation on a couple of features to smooth variations and map to a range of -1 to 1.
- **Reciprocal and Zero-Scale**: Incorporate `reciprocal` and `zero_scale` transformations to handle extreme values or center distributions. 

By following these derivations, we're adding potentially useful non-linear, interaction, and scaled transformations that could capture significant trends beneficial for improving the predictive power of our model regarding credit card application success.

```
[f1, f2, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f13, f14, f14 quan_trans, f1 tanh, f1 sin, f0 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f12 tanh, f14 quan_trans tanh, f1 tanh tanh, f1 sin tanh, f13 tanh, f14 stand_scaler, f1 f14 -, f1 f2 *, f1 f10 /, f2 f8 +, f11 f14 *, f6 log, f9 square, f12 sin, f0 sqrt, f13 f14 /]
```

In this improved feature set:
- We've combined some features directly to capture interactions like `f1 f2 *` and `f1 f14 -`. 
- We've used basic arithmetic operations to indicate potential compounded or negated effects between pairs and ensure input variability.
- We've applied a variety of transformations (e.g., `log`, `square`, `sqrt`, `sin`, `tanh`, etc.) to capture different scales and nonlinear relationships.
- Operations like `log`, `sqrt`, and `square` are added to potentially enhance the predictive power by reflecting alternative mathematical perspectives.
- We included additional computations across features with simple arithmetic logic to enhance interpretability and transactional relationships.

The improved feature set aims to leverage combined feature relationships and non-linear transformations, which could be more effective in capturing the underlying patterns corresponding to credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:23:52,204 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we'll incorporate concepts from feature engineering, ensuring good representation and scaling, while also adding non-linear transformations that might capture complex relationships in the data. Considering the features used in the examples you've given, we'll leverage operations that might help capture interactions or key transformations.

Here's a new set of derived features:

1. Keep the original features for baseline information.
2. Use `square` to capture potential quadratic relationships.
3. Use `sqrt` for controlling scale and potential square root relationships.
4. Use `cube` to capture cubic relationships and possible interactions.
5. Use `reciprocal` to emphasize smaller values in certain features.
6. Use `log` to reduce skewness for features with larger ranges or distributions.
7. Including combinations that could represent interactions between certain features.

Let's construct the feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, 
 f14 log,

 f13 cube, 
 f5 f6 *, 
 f8 f10 tanh, 
 f2 f4 *, 
 f11 f14 log, 
 f12 f14 /]
```

This new feature set uses a mix of transformations, interactions, and mathematical operations to capture potential non-linear relationships in the data, which might lead to better predictive performance in identifying successful credit card applications.

```

### Key considerations:
1. **Retained Features**: Most of the potentially useful features from both examples are preserved.
2. **Transformations**: 
   - **Non-linear**: Utilized `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cos` for capturing complex non-linear relationships.
   - **Scaling**: Kept `minmax_scaler` for `f13`, which possibly represents a non-numerical feature that benefits from scaling between 0 and 1.
   - **Dimensionality**: Combined operations on the same feature (e.g., `f14 sqrt`, `f2 cube`) for non-linearity and dimensionality.
   - **Feature Interactions**: Adding combined transformations like `tanh reciprocal` enriches the interaction space. 
3. **New Dimensionality Reducer**: Kept `f4 square` to capture quadratic relationships, potentially useful for features like ‘Debt’ or ‘YearsEmployed’.

This feature set retains robust variability and diverse transformations to potentially improve the prediction model's performance.

Newly added transformations include:

- `f13 f14 /`: Ratio of two potentially informative features could highlight relationships or dependencies.
- `f14 log`: Log transformation to handle higher variation in the scaled income data to potentially normalize skewed distributions.
- `f0 f14 *`: Product of gender and scaled income, which could capture interplay between demographic attributes and financial capacity.

2026-01-12 11:24:08,788 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, let's combine elements from both provided sets to enhance feature representation for the downstream task. The goal is to maintain a feature set that's comprehensive and can help in better predictions. We will take elements that may hold information relating to non-linear transformations and scale adherence which might capture the underlying complexity of the data better.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 sqrt ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f4 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f7 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f11 tanh ,f12 tanh ,f13 minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
- **Original Features**: Start with all original features `f0 to f14`.
- **Square Root Transformation**: Use `f14 sqrt` from both examples, which could help stabilize variance and normalize distributions.
- **Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) Transformation**: Apply `tanh` to features `f0 to f12` to introduce non-linearity, helping the model capture complex relationships.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Include `f13 minmax_scaler` to normalize the `ZipCode` feature, ensuring that its scaling is consistent with others, as the spread in `ZipCode` can be quite large.

This transformed feature set leverages powerful non-linear transformations and scaling approaches to enrich information representation for potential improvement in credit card application prediction.

2026-01-12 11:24:15,860 - INFO - llm output = To derive a new feature set that improves upon the two given examples, we will selectively combine features that seem to capture more variability in the data and could potentially be more predictive for the task. We aim to create features that maintain complexity but reduce redundancy while capturing essential interactions and transformations from the two sets.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f2, f4, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f13, f2 cube, f4 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f2 f7 + cube, f2 f8 + cube, f2 f9 + cube, f3 cube cube, f5 cube cube, f8 f10 + cube, f2 f10 cube +, f2 f7 cube +, f3 f5 + cube, f9 cube cube, f4 cube cube, f12 cube cube, f7 f13 +]
```

### Explanation:
- **Feature selection**: Maintained core features from the original sets while emphasizing transformations that are likely to contribute to meaningful patterns (e.g., cubic transformations, sums of important numerical features).
- **Combinatorial exploration**: Added combinations that involve sums of features followed by cubic transformations, which might help in capturing non-linear relationships.
- **Reduced redundancy**: Reduced overly repeated complex transformations while ensuring a variety in feature interactions that could be meaningful for the model to learn from.
- **Included essential cubes**: Incorporating cube transformations for features that are numerically significant like `f2`, `f4`, `f7`, and `f8`. These cubes are used as they might indicate more intricate patterns within those dimensions.
- **Variety from both sets**: Combined transformations in the suggested feature set by considering useful transformations from both sets, hence a more balanced approach to feature engineering.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:24:24,277 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we should aim to increase the diversity and derive potentially informative interactions or transformations among features. Here's an improved feature set, merging ideas from both examples:

```

```

**Explanation:**
- **Direct Features:** Includes original features up to `f14`, as they might provide significant information.
- **Inverse Relation:** `f1 reciprocal` creates an inverse feature which may highlight relationships not evident in a direct scale.
- **Cubic Transformation:** `f13 cube` may reveal nonlinear interactions related to zip code or geographical aspects.
- **Feature Interactions and Combinations:**
  - `f1 f13 /`: Ratio between gender and scaled zip code to potentially capture gender-related geographical trends.
  - `f3 f5 * tanh`: Interaction between `Married` and `BankCustomer`, transformed using `tanh` to handle nonlinearities.
  - `f0 f8 + sqrt`: Summing `Gender` with `PriorDefault` (potentially binary outcomes) and applying `sqrt` to smooth the data.
  - `f2 f10 - square`: Difference between `Age` and `CreditScore` could show age-creditworthiness trends, squared to enhance larger differences.
  - `f4 f12 / quan_trans`: Ratio of `BankCustomer` to `DriversLicense`, with quantile transformation for standardization and normalization.
- **Statistical Transforms & Functions:** 
  - `f6 log`: Log transformation on `Ethnicity` to manage skewness if applicable.
  - `f9 sin` and `f12 cos`: Using trigonometric functions to expose periodicities or oscillatory patterns in `Employment`.
  - `f7 stand_scaler`: Standardizes `YearsEmployed` to mean 0 and standard deviation of 1, offering better comparability.
  - `f10 sinh`: Hyperbolic sine on `CreditScore` for handling both positive and negative values gracefully.

This set combines original features, simple mathematical transformations, feature interactions, and statistical transformations, aiming to expose complex relationships and improve the predictive power of the model.

Explanation:
- `f14 log`: Applying a logarithmic transformation to `Income` to reduce skewness, which could be helpful in capturing relative differences in income levels.
- `f2 f9 +`: Adding `Debt` and `CreditScore` as these two features might be related to individuals' financial stability, an important factor for credit card approval.
- `f6 f8 f5 * +`: A combination of `Industry`, `PriorDefault`, and `Ethnicity` that could capture vital socio-economic factors impacting credit success.
- `f7 f14 /`: The ratio of `YearsEmployed` to `Income`, potentially indicating financial growth over time.
- `f10 cube`: Cubing `DriversLicense` might emphasize its potential non-linear relationship with the target.
- `f0 f1 * f12 +`: A combination of `Gender`, `Age`, and `ZipCode` that may provide insights into demographic and regional trends in credit card approval.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- `f8 f1 cube +` can represent more non-linear relationships involving `PriorDefault` and `Age`.
- `f14 f1 tanh +` introduces a non-linear transformation capturing possible interactions between `Income` and `Age`.
- `f13 sin f8 cube +` allows capturing periodic patterns or interactions enhanced by non-linear effects involving `Citizen` and `PriorDefault`.
- `f9 cube f11 sqrt +` introduces non-linear effects between `Employed` and `CreditScore`.
- `f10 f9 f13 sin * +` captures complex interactions between `CreditScore`, `Employed`, and a periodic transformation of `Citizen`.
- `f2 cube f3 f6 + *` represents a potentially sophisticated interaction of `Debt`, `Married`, and `Industry`.

However, the first feature set includes a variety of transformed features that capture non-linear relationships (e.g., `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, `reciprocal`, `minmax_scaler`, `sqrt`, `cos`), which can enhance the ability of models to capture complex patterns in the data. 

To create a better feature set, I'll combine useful transformations and ensure a mix of scaled and non-linear transformations for feature enhancement while keeping the set concise.

Here is the improved feature set:

Explanation:
- I've included basic feature transformations like `tanh` and `sqrt` for age and debt.
- Applied `tanh` to the employment status which is usually impactful.
- Cosine transformation on `CreditScore` which might help capture cyclical patterns.
- Standard and min-max scaling on `Income` and `ZipCode` to handle the wide range and improve model performance on scaled inputs.
- Applied `sigmoid` transformation on `PriorDefault` to compress the range in case it's useful for non-linear relations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

**Explanation:**
- Retain the base features (`f0` to `f14`) to maintain basic informative features in the data.
- Use `f1 reciprocal` from the second set, which may highlight non-linear relationships involving the `Gender` feature.
- Include `f2 cube`, which could capture non-linear interactions relating to the `Age` feature from the first set.
- `f1 tanh`, which can stabilize `Gender` values and capture non-linear effects, taken from the first set.
- `f1 f1 -` from the second set, which might highlight variance or key differences related to `Gender`.

2026-01-12 11:25:02,579 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature transformation examples and the improvement in the second feature set, I'll propose a new feature set that builds upon the previous ones. The goal here is to capture essential patterns and improve model performance by leveraging advanced transformations. We'll focus on a variety of transformations, including scaling, nonlinear functions, and combinations of existing features.

```

 f1 f14 sqrt *, f12 f6 tanh /]
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Original Features and Non-linear Transformations:** The original features are included, and a variety of non-linear transformations such as `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `minmax_scaler` are applied to offer various perspectives and capture the non-linearity in data.

2. **Log Transformations:** The `log` transformation is applied to features with a large range to mitigate skewness and stabilize variance.

3. **Feature Interactions and Combination:** Interaction terms like `f2 f7 *` and `f0 f5 f8 + *` are included to capture complex relationships between different features. These combinations are based on domain knowledge that such interactions could be relevant for predicting credit card applications (e.g., combining features that together influence credit worthiness like debt, years employed, and income).

4. **Mixed Transformations:** Applying a transformation like `tanh` or `reciprocal` after certain interactions focuses on capturing underlying patterns, potentially improving learning models' distinguishing abilities.

5. **Reduced Complexity:** To maintain model interpretability and avoid overfitting, the postfix expression retains a balanced complexity by limiting the depth of transformations and hybrids of features.

By applying these feature transformations, the new feature set aims to enhance the model's prediction accuracy for successful credit card applications.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The goal is to maximize the extraction of information from the available features and transformations.

Here's the proposed feature set:

```

```

In this feature set, I've included transformations that primarily revolve around `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, and `f14`, such as cubes, squares, and various transformations like `sin`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid`, considering your indication that more complex transformations are often more predictive. Additionally, key combinations, such as the sum of `f2` and `f13`, are included with further transformations to enhance the feature interactions that might help in achieving a better prediction model.

```

This feature set includes the following transformations:
- Squared terms of relevant features to capture quadratic relationships.
- Non-linear transformations like `sin` and `tanh` for capturing periodic and saturation effects.
- Interaction terms to capture relationships between Gender and Married status (`f0 f3 *`), Years Employed and Age (`f2 f7 +`), and other interactions.
- Logarithmic and square root transformations to stabilize variance and manage skewness.
- Trigonometric transformations to capture cyclic patterns, especially in features like Income or CreditScore.
- Combination of features that could capture multiplicative interactions (`f0 f14 *`). 

Each transformation is intended to extract more intricate patterns from the data that a model can exploit for better predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:25:18,566 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the given examples, I will select transformations that provide additional insights into the data distribution or relationships between existing features, while considering the progression from the given examples.

Here's a new feature set:
```

```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`f2 f8 *`**: This feature multiplies `f2` (Debt) and `f8` (PriorDefault). It can provide insights into how debt levels combined with prior defaults impact credit application success.

2. **`f1 tanh`**: Applying the hyperbolic tangent function to `f1` (Age) could help to normalize age, effectively keeping values between -1 and 1, and capture non-linear relationships potentially useful for predicting outcomes. 

These additional features continue to build on the existing transformations, while introducing interactions and non-linear scaling that could enhance the predictive power of your feature set.

Explanation:
- I included combinations from the examples like `f1 f9 *` and `f2 square`, which may highlight interactions or non-linear relationships.
- Added `f3 f4 *` to see if interactions between marriage (f3) and bank customer status (f4) provide valuable information.
- Added some non-linear transformations such as `f8 tanh` and `f13 sqrt` to possibly capture non-linear patterns.
- Included operations like `f13 log` to stabilize variance and handle skewness.
- Used a standard scaler operation on `f14` to ensure that features are on a consistent scale.
- Attempted additional basic arithmetic combinations to reveal underlying relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:25:46,969 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two sets of feature transformations provided, the second set incorporates a broader range of initial features and additional transformations on the original features. To create a third, potentially better set, I'll combine elements from both examples and introduce additional meaningful transformations. Here's an attempt at doing so:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 tanh, f13 tanh, f0 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f12 tanh, f14 tanh tanh, f13 tanh tanh, f6 sqrt, f14 cube, f3 sqrt, f7 reciprocal, f14 sqrt, f2 log]
```

This new set includes:
1. The original features (f0 to f14).
2. Some transformations involving the hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) because it can help in squashing feature distributions.
3. The square root transformation of certain features (`f6`, `f3`, `f14`) which can be useful for handling skewed distributions.
4. The `reciprocal` transformation for `f7`, which can be useful when transformation is beneficial for handling features with larger values.
5. The `log` transformation for `f2`, which can manage skewness in continuous features.

These transformations aim to capture nonlinear relationships and normalize feature distributions to potentially improve the predictive performance of the model.

We'll introduce additional transformations that could help capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. Here's a new recommended feature set:

```plaintext

```

Explanation of the new transformations:
- `f14 sigmoid`: Applying the sigmoid function to `f14` could help normalize this feature, especially if it might have extreme values.
- `f0 f1 *`: This interaction term multiplies `f0` and `f1`, capturing any potential interactions between these two features.
- `f2 f3 /`: This generates a new feature considering the ratio of `f2` to `f3`, which might reveal the relative importance or relationship between them.
- `f4 f5 +`: Adding `f4` and `f5` might help capture the combined effect of these features.
- `f6 f7 -`: Calculating the difference between `f6` and `f7` could capture if there's any opposing influence or balance between these features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:26:05,991 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by using the provided two feature sets, we should consider the utility of the features and the transformations applied. As stated, the latter feature set is generally better, and we're tasked with creating an even better one than those given. We need to balance the complexity of the transformations while capturing useful, informative patterns for predicting successful credit card applications. I'll generate a new feature set by selecting advantageous transformations and possibly combining them in a way that could enhance predictive power:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f1 reciprocal, f1 f1 -, f13 cube, f14 log, f7 f2 *, f0 f4 +]
```

Explanation:

1. **f14 log**: Applying the log transformation to income can help normalize skewed distributions and highlight differences in income levels.
   
2. **f7 f2 ***: Combining Years Employed and Debt could capture the debt-to-tenure ratio, indicating an individual's debt management over their career.
   
3. **f0 f4 +**: Adding Gender and BankCustomer can be a simplistic representation of demographic engagement with banking services, which could correlate with credit card application success.

These transformations and combinations aim to enrich the feature set by capturing latent patterns that might enhance the model's ability to predict the outcome of interest.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation of New Additions:

1. **Product and Sum Transformations**: 
   - These are included to capture potential interactions or cumulative effects between features. These can sometimes provide more insight into the relationships between features.

2. **Square Root and Square Transformations**:
   - Applying square root or square to features can sometimes normalize the distribution of features or enhance variance where needed.

3. **Log Transformation**:
   - Applying a logarithmic transformation can help in managing the skewness of features, particularly those with exponential distributions or large ranges.

These added transformations provide a broader range of derived features that can reveal hidden patterns and improve the predictive model’s performance.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:26:27,880 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we want to incorporate transformations that might capture non-linear relationships or interactions among features, deriving new insights that could potentially improve the predictive model's performance for the credit card application task. From the given examples, it seems that combining squared features and some mathematical operations on existing features has been considered effective. Here is a proposal for a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f0 square ,f1 square ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,

f14 sqrt f1 / ,f0 f1 * ,f9 f10 + ,f8 f7 / ,f5 log ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f13 sigmoid]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Square, Sqrt, and Polynomial Features**: Retaining features such as `f0 square`, `f1 square`, `f2 square`, etc., which can capture quadratic relationships.

2. **Interaction Terms**: `f0 f1 *` adds an interaction term between gender (perhaps representing gender and age), potentially exposing impactful interactions.

3. **Feature Scaling**: `f9 minmax_scaler` normalizes the `Employed` feature, making it more comparable across different scales (especially useful if dealing with algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude).

4. **Log Transforms**: `f5 log` is useful when dealing with skewed distributions, potentially for the `Debt` variable.

5. **Sigmoid Transformation**: `f13 sigmoid` modifies income distributions, holding potential for compressing large income ranges into a bounded domain.

6. **Feature Combinations**: `f9 f10 +` or `f8 f7 /` creates new features capturing combined information reflecting, for example, the relationship between employment status and driver's license possession.

The goal here is to increase the diversity of feature representations and possible interactions within the data, improving the model's ability to learn and capture crucial aspects of the successful credit card applicants.

### Explanation of the Newly Created Features:

1. **`f0, f1, ..., f14`**: Retain the original features for foundational information.

2. **`f1 reciprocal`**: The reciprocal of `f1` may help normalize or stabilize variance if `f1` has significant influence with large values.

3. **`f1 f1 -`**: Square of `f1` subtracted from `f1` can offer variations which highlight non-linear relationships.

4. **`f13 cube`**: Cubing `f13` enhances extreme values impact—useful if `f13` has meaningful discrete boundaries.

5. **`f2 f8 *`**: Multiplying `f2` with `f8` represents interaction between `f2` influence and time (`f8`) for potential credit risk estimation.

6. **`f1 tanh`**: Applying `tanh` on `f1`, capturing non-linearity effect which helps in saturation (emphasizing mid-range differences and shrinking outliers).

7. **`f12 log`**: Taking the logarithm of `f12`, which may reduce skewness and compress long-tail distributions, making patterns more evident.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:26:48,412 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, a more effective set can be constructed by considering a balance between complexity, interpretability, and potential predictive power. The aim is to generate new features that might capture non-linear relationships or higher-order interactions among the original features, while still ensuring that the feature set remains manageable and interpretable.

Here's a new feature set leveraging insights from the two provided examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f13 cube, f0 f13 cube +, f2 f13 cube +, f3 f13 cube +, f4 f13 cube +, f5 f13 cube +, f6 f13 cube +, f7 f13 cube +, f8 f13 cube +, f9 f13 cube +, f10 f13 cube +, f11 f13 cube +, f12 f13 cube +, f0 f13 cube cube +]
```

This feature set attempts to capture interactions between the `f13 cube` transformation and other features individually, while retaining the base features for context. The enhanced features aim to identify complex patterns that might be lost otherwise, and the final feature computes a higher-order interaction of the cube of `f13` and `f0`, which could bring unique insight into the model.
