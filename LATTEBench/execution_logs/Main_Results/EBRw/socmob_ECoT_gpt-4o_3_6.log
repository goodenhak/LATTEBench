2026-01-13 11:45:43,066 - INFO - llm output = Sure, let's examine the two feature set examples you provided and generate a new, improved feature set. 

The first set largely incorporates complex combinations involving the sigmoid transformation of features. This can be useful in many machine-learning scenarios and is particularly helpful when dealing with larger ranges or when you need to compress and normalize values between 0 and 1. The introduction of multiple transformations like `quan_trans` (quantile transformation) adds complexity and non-linearity, potentially capturing nuanced relationships in data.

The second set is much simpler. It mainly applies the sigmoid transformation individually to features, providing normalized versions useful for machine learning models where scale matters.

To create a better feature set based on these examples, we aim to combine complexity and simplicity, ensuring that the engineered features capture nuanced relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f4 f2 sigmoid sigmoid * f3 sigmoid * , f4 f3 sigmoid f2 sigmoid * quan_trans * , f4 f2 sigmoid sigmoid * f2 sigmoid * , f4 f3 sigmoid * f4 f3 sigmoid * quan_trans , f4 sigmoid f3 sigmoid f2 sigmoid * * , f4 f3 sigmoid * f4 f2 sigmoid sigmoid * cube , f4 f2 sigmoid f3 sigmoid * f2 sigmoid sigmoid * * ]
```

Here's a breakdown of the transformations:

1. **Complex Interaction**: Combining `[f4 f2 sigmoid sigmoid *]` with `[f3 sigmoid]`, using a multiplication operation, preserves complexity while introducing a new feature from `f3`.
   
2. **Combined Non-linear Transformation**: Using sigmoid applied twice to `[f4 f3]` followed by a multiplicative interaction with `[f2 sigmoid]` helps capture interactions that sigmoid alone cannot dissect. The `quan_trans` also introduces a non-linear scaling beneficial for accounting for statistical distribution biases.

3. **Simplified Interaction**: By applying repeated sigmoid on `f2` and multiplying with itself, you examine the potential of embedding squared interaction among counts and occupation features.
   
4. **Instructor Relationship**: Layers of transformations enhance capturing deep-seated patterns, while `quan_trans` adds the ability to shift extensive and diverse feature ranges toward normalized quantiles.
   
5. **Transposed Complexity**: Utilizing sigmoid separately on multiple features and performing a cumulative multiplication highlights correlated behaviors across different social stratification data points.
   
6. **Cubed Amplification**: Introducing multiplicative cubing surfaces various layered and amplified features on an eigenlevel between `f2` and already sigmoid altered features.
   
7. **Synergized Repetition**: Multiplying sigmoid applied on `[f2]`, potentially captures effects of feature redundancy exploitation along normalized transformations.

Using these combinations allows us to explore both hierarchical feature interactions and individualized linear transformations, helping the machine-learning model better predict son’s occupation counts with greater fidelity.

2026-01-13 11:46:09,347 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we need to ensure that we are capturing potentially useful interactions and transformations, while considering non-linearities and scale adjustments that could improve the model performance.

Let's analyze the two provided feature sets:

1. The first feature set seems to heavily involve applying the sigmoid function, quantile transformation, and multiplication. This could imply an emphasis on capturing interactions between features in a non-linear transformed space.

2. The second feature set is more about applying individual transformations such as sigmoid, cube, and standard scaling, with some interactions between features.

Given the goal is often to enhance the expressiveness and discriminative power of features, a third feature set could attempt to blend these approaches by emphasizing both interaction terms and individual transformations. Here’s a proposed better feature set:

```text
[f4 f2 sigmoid sigmoid * ,f4 f3 sigmoid * f4 f3 sigmoid * quan_trans * ,f3 sigmoid sigmoid f4 cube * ,f4 f2 quant_trans sigmoid * ,f4 stand_scaler f3 sigmoid * ,f4 sin f3 sigmoid * ,f4 f3 sigmoid * f4 f3 sigmoid * quan_trans sigmoid * f4 cube sigmoid * ,f4 f2 sigmoid f4 f3 sigmoid * sigmoid * ,f4 f2 sigmoid * f4 f3 sigmoid * quan_trans sigmoid * ,f4 f2 stand_scaler f3 cube sigmoid * ,f4 f3 sigmoid * f4 f3 sigmoid * quan_trans * f4 sin * ,f4 f3 sigmoid * f4 f3 sigmoid * quan_trans f4 stand_scaler * ,f4 f2 sigmoid sigmoid * f4 f3 sigmoid * sigmoid f4 f3 sigmoid * quan_trans *]
```

Explanation:
- Retained the use of sigmoid due to its ability to introduce non-linearity and regulate values.
- Incorporated 'quan_trans' and 'stand_scaler' to adjust and standardize the distribution.
- Included interactions (multiplications) between different transformations to explore joint non-linear relationships.
- The use of 'cube' and 'sin' adds variety in exploring non-linear relationships.

This balanced approach should help in capturing complex relationships while standardizing and scaling features when necessary for better model performance in predicting the two-class nominal target.

```

Explanation:
- **`f4`**: Retained as it directly relates to the target column `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
- **Transformations**: A variety of transformations like sigmoid, quan_trans (quantile transformation), sqrt (square root), and log (logarithm) are applied to `f3` and `f4`. These transformations can help normalize and scale the data, potentially improving model performance.
- **Interaction Terms**: Multiplications of `f3` and `f4` are maintained, as these interactions can capture joint effects of features that relate to the target.
- **Escalation of Transformations**: Deep chaining of transformations like `sigmoid` and `sqrt` on `f3` can explore non-linear interactions that might capture complex relationships.

This integrated approach aims to leverage feature diversity while emphasizing key transformations that have shown utility in the examples provided.

We will aim for a blend of raw features and transformed features to encompass various types of information.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f4 stand_scaler ,f4 log ,f0 f1 * ,f2 f3 / ,f3 sqrt]
```

Explanation:
- `f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4`: These are the original features to retain the baseline information.
- `f4 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling is often useful to normalize distributions with varying scales, which can be particularly useful for the `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
- `f4 log`: The logarithm can help reduce skewness in the distribution, potentially making patterns more apparent.
- `f0 f1 *`: Interaction terms (products of two features) can capture dependencies between features that may affect the target variable.
- `f2 f3 /`: A division of two features that could provide insights into ratios or proportions.
- `f3 sqrt`: Taking the square root can sometimes stabilize variance and normalize non-normal distributions.

This feature set provides a good balance of raw and transformed features, offering a diverse range of information that may potentially improve the model's ability to understand complex relationships and patterns in the data.

Explanation:
- We retain critical features and operations present in both examples.
- Keeping `f0 stand_scaler` and `f1 stand_scaler` provides normalized features that could be useful depending on distribution.
- Including `f4 sin` and `f0 sin` introduces nonlinear transformations that can capture complex patterns.
- Use of `f4 sigmoid` and `f4 sigmoid sigmoid` across variants for its smoothing effect on feature distribution.
- `f2 sigmoid` and `f3 sigmoid` provide a universal transformation potential for their respective features.
- Incorporating another variation with `f0 stand_scaler sqrt` introduces a non-linear scaling transformation that might prove useful.
- `f4 sigmoid tanh` adds more depth in transformation, considering both sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions for capturing different kinds of nonlinear relationships.

These features aim to capture diverse transformations that may better align the dataset characteristics for predictive modeling.

Let's construct a new feature set that integrates some intricate transformations from the given examples to create more informative features:

1. Include more interactions between features.
2. Leverage higher-order transformations.
3. Utilize nonlinear transformations to capture potential complex relationships.

Here is the proposed better feature set:

```
[f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f0 f1 + ,f2 f3 + ,f0 f4 sqrt ,f1 f4 sqrt ,f0 f2 * ,f1 f3 * ,f2 f4 * ,f0 f1 + tanh ,f2 f3 + tanh ,f3 f4 + tanh ,f0 f1 cube ,f1 f2 cube ,f2 f3 cube]
```

Explanation:
- Maintain several original features: [f1, f2, f3, f4] for foundational data.
- Use pairwise addition to capture combined effects: [f0 f1 +, f2 f3 +].
- Apply nonlinear transformations (sqrt) across different features along with original features: [f0 f4 sqrt, f1 f4 sqrt].
- Introduce multiplication to generate interaction terms: [f0 f2 *, f1 f3 *, f2 f4 *].
- Utilize tanh transformations post-addition to capture non-linear relationships: [f0 f1 + tanh, f2 f3 + tanh, f3 f4 + tanh].
- Incorporate cube operations to handle higher-order interactions: [f0 f1 cube, f1 f2 cube, f2 f3 cube].

In this new feature set:
- We retain the original features for baseline comparison.
- We apply standard scaling to `f0` and min-max scaling to `f4`, maintaining these popular scaling techniques.
- We apply non-linear transformations strategically: `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, and `log` to capture different aspects and potential non-linear patterns in the data.
- Cubing `f2` and squaring `f2` are added to enhance the representation of polynomial relationships.

2026-01-13 11:47:19,469 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions on the given dataset, we can engineer features that capture additional patterns and relationships not explicitly presented by the raw data. Based on the two provided feature sets, I've crafted a better set using different transformations and scaling techniques to potentially enhance model performance. My goal is to provide a diverse set of features that might capture different aspects of the underlying data.

Here's the improved feature set:

```
[f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f0 log ,f1 tanh ,f4 reciprocal ,f3 sqrt ,f0 reciprocal ,f2 cube]
```

### Explanation:
- **f2 minmax_scaler**: Scaling `f2` can help in normalizing its distribution across a bounded range, useful for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.
- **f3 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling on `f3` helps in centering the feature and normalizing its variance, often contributing to better convergence in models.
- **f0 log**: Applying the logarithm to `f0` can transform exponential distributions into a linear scale, which can be beneficial for linear models.
- **f1 tanh**: The tanh transformation on `f1` can map the feature within a -1 to 1 range, potentially capturing its non-linearity.
- **f4 reciprocal**: Inverse transformation of `f4` to highlight differences in smaller values.
- **f3 sqrt**: Square root transformation can reduce skewness and spread out the data within a smaller range.
- **f0 reciprocal**: Reciprocal transformation on `f0` may reveal inverse relationships not explicitly detected in the raw feature.
- **f2 cube**: Cubing `f2` could help in capturing polynomial relationships, especially in non-linear models.

These selected transformations are aimed at capturing a variety of patterns, smoothing data, and providing better features for classification tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Based on the two given feature sets, the latter seems to be more comprehensive as it includes scaling methods (e.g., quan_trans, stand_scaler) and a larger variety of mathematical operations (e.g., division, multiplication, square root). Here is an improved feature set incorporating these concepts:

- Various scaling techniques are used to normalize the data, such as `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans`.
- Diverse mathematical transformations (e.g., `log`, `sqrt`, `cube`, `tanh`) are applied to capture non-linear relationships.
- Combination of features through operations like addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction allows for interactions between features.
- Nesting of transformations and operations is utilized for complex feature interactions, aiming to enhance predictive modeling power.

1. Use sigmoids for non-linearity.
2. Incorporate sin for periodicity.
3. Include some basic arithmetic operations.
4. Utilize quantile transformation for skewness adjustments.

Key Improvements:
- Utilized more complex feature transformations such as `cube sqrt` for potentially capturing nonlinear relationships.
- Included `log` transformation on `f4` to handle large differences in range and reduce skewness.
- Combined `reciprocal` and `minmax_scaler` for normalization and feature inversion on `f1`, which can introduce different patterns for models to learn from.
- Enhanced feature interaction through composition like `sigmoid tanh` on `f3`.

These transformations and feature combinations might uncover additional patterns or interactions in the dataset, aiding better classification between positive ('P') and negative ('N').

2026-01-13 11:48:34,857 - INFO - llm output = Sure, let's create a new feature set combining various transformations to improve the downstream task prediction capabilities. A key approach to feature engineering is to capture non-linear relationships and to help ameliorate distributions that might be skewing or affecting the model performance adversely. Combining various transformations can uncover hidden patterns in the data.

Here's a refined feature set example:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 log ,f2 cube ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 sigmoid ,f0 f1 * ,f3 f4 +]
```

In this feature set:
- Min-max scaling is applied to `f0` to normalize its range to [0, 1].
- Log transformation on `f1` to handle skewness.
- Cubing `f2` to capture the non-linear effects with potential high variance.
- Standard scaling on `f3` to standardize its mean and variance.
- Sigmoid transformation applied to `f4` to keep values between 0 and 1 in a non-linear fashion.
- Interaction terms are created using multiplication and addition between different transformed features to capture complex relationships within the dataset.

- `f4 log`: Log transformation of `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` might capture multiplicative relationships in the data.
- `f2 tanh`: Applying the hyperbolic tangent to `family_structure` could help in capturing non-linear relationships.
- `f0 f3 /`: Interaction capturing the ratio between `fathers_occupation` and `race`.
- `f1 cube`: Cubing `sons_occupation` to capture higher-order interactions.
- `f3 sqrt`: Taking the square root of `race` to reduce skewness in the distribution if there is any.

### Explanation:

1. **Original Features:** Kept the basic features from both sets: `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`.

2. **Combined Features:** Included the combined features `f0 f4 +` and `f1 f4 +` from both examples.

3. **Quantile Transformation:** `f0 quan_trans` and `f1 quan_trans` are included to handle potential non-linear distributions.

4. **Sigmoid Transformations:** Used `f1 sigmoid`, `f2 sigmoid sigmoid`, `f3 sigmoid`, and `f3 sigmoid sigmoid` to convert features into the (0,1) range and possibly linearize relationships.

5. **Sine Transformation:** Applied to the combined feature `f0 f4 + sin` to possibly reveal cyclical patterns.

6. **Square Transformation:** Applied to `f0 f4 + square` to capture interaction effects potentially useful for the target prediction.

These transformations provide a diverse set of features that could reveal complex nonlinear relationships in the data, potentially improving the predictive performance of the model.
