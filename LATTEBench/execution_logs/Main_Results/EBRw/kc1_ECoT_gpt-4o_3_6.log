you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:55:14,412 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, I'll blend the transformation operations strategically to improve their potential usefulness in predictive modeling. The improved feature set will incorporate a mix of standard scaling, quantization, and non-linear transformations, along with some arithmetic and compound operations.

Here is the enhanced feature set:

```
[f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f4 log, f5 sin, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 tanh, f10 log, f11 quan_trans, f12 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f16 sqrt, f17 sin, f18 minmax_scaler, f19 stand_scaler, f20 stand_scaler, f11 f11 *, f9 f4 -, f4 sqrt, f3 log, f3 sqrt, f2 log, f11 quan_trans stand_scaler, f5 sqrt cube, f5 sin stand_scaler, f5 cos stand_scaler, f8 cube quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f16 quan_trans, f7 cube minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f18 sqrt quan_trans, f7 sin stand_scaler sqrt]
```

Key improvements:
1. **Mix of nonlinear transformations**: Operations like `log`, `sqrt`, `sin`, and `cos` on various features introduce non-linearity, which might help capture underlying patterns in the data.
2. **Scaling operations**: The use of `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` helps ensure that feature values are normalized, which can improve model convergence and interpretability.
3. **Enhanced arithmetic operations**: Operations like `f11 f11 *` and `f9 f4 -` introduce interaction terms that might reveal relationships between different features.
4. **Continuation of quantization**: Using `quan_trans` on multiple features can help discretize continuous data, potentially simplifying the learning task for certain models (e.g., decision trees). 

These strategic transformations are intended to preserve a balance between complexity and interpretability while maximizing the theoretical utility for predicting software defects.

2026-01-12 14:55:20,196 - INFO - llm output = To improve and optimize the feature engineering process while considering the transformations applied in your examples, we need to balance complexity with interpretability, and derive meaningful features that could help the prediction task. Let's focus on generating derived features that exploit and transform the original features in various ways, aiming to reveal underlying patterns.

Here's a new feature set based on the provided examples:

```

```

In this feature set:
- I've incorporated basic arithmetic operations like multiplication and division to uncover interactions between features.
- Included feature differences to capture the relative differences among specific features.
- Retained some feature transformations from the examples such as `cube`, `sqrt`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, and `tanh` to enable non-linear transformations, which could be crucial for capturing complex relationships.
- Balancing the use of transformations so as not to overcomplicate the feature set, ensuring the transformed features remain interpretable and useful for prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

The second example involves complex operations and interactions, and I will build upon them.

Below is a new feature set that builds on the latter example, incorporating additional interaction terms and transformations to capture more complex relationships:

```
[f5 ,f7 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f9 sqrt ,f18 minmax_scaler ,f18 minmax_scaler reciprocal reciprocal ,f9 sqrt minmax_scaler reciprocal reciprocal ,f8 f5 + ,f13 f9 + ,f9 sqrt f12 + ,f5 reciprocal reciprocal f5 + ,f18 minmax_scaler reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal f5 + ,f9 sqrt minmax_scaler reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 f9 + f5 + ,f1 f9 + f5 + ,f3 f9 + f5 + ,f4 f9 + f5 + ,f6 f9 + f5 + ,f7 f9 + f5 + ,f8 f9 + f5 + ,f10 f9 + f5 + ,f15 f9 + f5 + ,f17 f9 + f5 + ,f18 f9 + f5 + ,f19 f9 + f5 + ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal f5 + ,f5 sqrt f9 sqrt minmax_scaler * ,f5 cube ,f18 tanh ,f9 log ,f13 sigmoid ,f0 f10 + f5 sqrt * ,f4 f11 * f9 sqrt + ,f2 f7 minmax_scaler +]
```

This new feature set includes additional transformation operations such as `cube`, `tanh`, `log`, and `sigmoid`, which can help capture non-linear relationships. Interaction terms, like `f0 f10 + f5 sqrt * `, have also been added to potentially capture interactions between code complexity and length features.

Explanation:

- Retained some original features for baseline input data (`f4, f5, f6, ..., f20`).
- Added reciprocal and square root transformations for a selection of features (`f0, f1, ..., f10`) to capture non-linear behavior.
- Included interaction terms to capture relationships between pairs of features, e.g., `f0 f1 *`, `f2 f3 *`.
- Used non-linear operations like `tanh`, `log`, `cube`, and `sigmoid` in combination with interactions to increase feature diversity.
- Kept the feature set compact and focused on meaningful transformations to prevent overfitting while improving the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data.

```

**Explanation:**

1. Retained important standalone features (`f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, `f11`, `f18`) from both examples as they often directly represent critical aspects of the data.

2. Employed `quan_trans`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, `sqrt`, and `log` transformations on various features, which are known to help normalize or capture non-linear relationships.

3. Introduced operations such as `tanh`, `cos`, and `reciprocal`, which can help capture oscillatory or inverse relationships if they exist in the data.

4. Combined transformations with arithmetic operations to form new composite features that might capture interactive effects (`f4 f9 sqrt tanh sigmoid -`, `f11 f5 * f9 sqrt +`, `f6 quan_trans sigmoid +`).

5. Used combinations of square (`cube` and `sqrt`) and logarithmic transformation (`log`) to see potential improvements through scale adjustments or handling skewed distributions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

1. Incorporate transformations that are likely to capture non-linear relationships and standardize the data, making it more suited for algorithms that depend on features being on similar scales.
2. Use feature differences and potentially useful mathematical transformations.

This feature set considers:
- Differences from a key feature (`f5`) as previously used.
- Square root transformation and standardization, which helps normalize skewed data.
- Additional transformations to further capture interactions and relationships (`/`, `*`, `+`).

```

This new feature set leverages transformations such as `log`, `quan_trans`, and `cube` on existing features, aiming for capturing nonlinear relations and scaling effects. Using operations like `log` and `cube` can amplify differences between defect-prone modules and others, potentially improving the predictive power of the model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
1. Inclusion of reciprocal and log transformations on several features to capture non-linear relationships.
2. Squaring the 'f18' and then applying square again to capture polynomial effects.
3. Removed excessive recursive reciprocal transformations to reduce redundancy and potential numerical instability.
4. Focused on meaningful transformations and reduced excessive feature generation to maintain computational efficiency.

2026-01-12 14:56:02,614 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the given examples, we will aim to combine meaningful transformations while reducing redundancy. Let's streamline the feature set and introduce complexity while maintaining interpretability:

```

This new feature set is derived to maintain useful transformations like reciprocal and square roots, while integrating scalers across different levels. It incorporates both direct transformations (like tanh for additional non-linearity) and scaling (using minmax_scaler), aiming for a balanced approach between complexity and interpretability. Redundant transformations are minimized, and the introduction of `quan_trans` on f4 potentially captures quantile-based distribution insights.

The additions and modifications include utilizing transformations such as `sqrt`, `log`, `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cube`, applied to various original features, to explore non-linear relationships and achieve better normalization and scaling.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:56:14,654 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the provided examples, let's consider incorporating a broader range of transformations while minimizing redundancy. We'll aim to include features that introduce non-linear transformations and scaling that can help uncover complex relationships in the data, while ensuring computational efficiency.

Here is the improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

### Key Updates:
1. **Advanced Transformations:** Added `f3 tanh`, `f6 sigmoid`, `f9 cube`, `f4 log`, and `f6 sin` to capture non-linear relationships and potential complex interactions within the dataset.
2. **Different Scaling Techniques:** Incorporated `f5 stand_scaler` to adjust and potentially improve the numeric stability and learning in downstream tasks.
3. **Efficiency & Redundancy:** While utilizing transformations like reciprocal and minmax_scaling, we've minimized deeper recursive applications more than necessary, optimizing computational efforts.
4. **Transformation Variety:** The new set includes a diverse range of mathematical transformations, scaling, and recursive operations striking a balance between feature richness and operational viability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:56:25,252 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for software defect prediction, we can create a new feature set by selecting and transforming features from the given examples while introducing new and potentially useful transformations. Here is the proposed improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f18 square ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f18 log ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f3 log ,f20 log ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f18 square square ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f18 tanh, f0 square square, f3 tanh, f5 sqrt, f6 cos, f9 sigmoid, f11 * f12]
```

In this improved feature set, I have incorporated transformations like `tanh`, `cos`, `sigmoid`, and combinations like `f11 * f12` (product of two features), which can capture nonlinear relationships and provide more complex interactions. These are aimed at enhancing predictive capabilities by allowing more flexibility and depth in the feature representation.

Key considerations in crafting this feature set include:
- Utilizing a range of operations (sqrt, cube, reciprocal, sin) on a subset of features that might capture non-linear relationships.
- Applying both simple transformations and combination transformations (e.g., sqrt coupled with cube).
- Incorporating statistical transformation methods like standard scaling, min-max scaling, quantile transformation, and sigmoid to normalize and transform certain features, potentially making them more relevant for the prediction model.
- Maintaining a balance of linear and non-linear transformations to provide the model with a diverse set of features that could capture different signal patterns for defect prediction.

```

Explanation:
- I have kept the same set of features as the original two examples.
- Applied sqrt transformation to reciprocal transformations for some features, which might help capture the diminishing effects with respect to defects.
- Applied tanh transformations to capture non-linear relationships and scale the values between -1 and 1 for reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal-transformed features.
- Combined cube, sigmoid, reciprocal, and cos transformations strategically to explore their potential in uncovering complex interactions.
- These transformations are designed to ensure a varied range of feature interactions which are of interest especially in binary classification tasks like defect prediction.

2026-01-12 14:56:44,527 - INFO - llm output = Sure, let's make a better feature set using the transformations and operations provided. We'll aim to provide a feature set that captures more nuanced relationships and utilizes a variety of transformations that might be beneficial for the prediction task.

Let's break down the given features and operations to create an improved feature set:

1. Utilize square and reciprocal transformations to add complexity.
2. Incorporate cube and sqrt for nonlinear interactions and feature variety.
3. Apply minmax_scaler and stand_scaler for feature normalization.
4. Use trigonometric and hyperbolic functions (sin, cos, tanh) to capture potential periodic or threshold behaviors.
5. Add logarithmic transformations for power law distributions.
6. Use quantile transformation for capturing distribution-based features.

Here's an improved feature set example:

```plaintext
[f0, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f16, f17, f18, f19, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 log, f12 sqrt, f16 sqrt, f17 sqrt, f18 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f7 cube, f8 cube, f16 cube, f8 square, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt cube, f16 sqrt cube, f18 sqrt cube, f0 reciprocal sqrt cube, f7 sin, f16 sin, f8 sqrt sin, f7 cube sin, f8 cube sin, f10 cube sin, f16 cube sin, f11 tanh, f12 tanh, f8 sin, f9 cos sin sqrt, f8 stand_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f8 quan_trans, f4 sqrt cube sin, f12 sqrt cube sin, f18 sqrt cube sin, f0 stand_scaler, f16 stand_scaler cos, f7 stand_scaler]
```

Key improvements:

- Added `f9 log` to capture any potential logarithmic relationships.
- Used `f9 sqrt` to explore nonlinear aspects of feature `f9`.
- Introduced `f8 square` to capture quadratic relationships involving `f8`.
- Applied `f9 cos sin sqrt` to capture complex interaction patterns.
- Incorporated `f0 stand_scaler` and `f16 stand_scaler cos` for standardized feature scaling with added complexity.
- `f7 stand_scaler` to ensure `f7` is normalized for use.

This feature set aims to give a richer representation of the underlying data and should help improve model predictions through diverse transformations and interaction patterns.

It's beneficial to emphasize transformations that amplify useful signals for prediction purposes while still keeping computational complexity in check.

**Explanation**:
- Added reciprocal transformations for features that may display diminishing marginal impacts when increases occur, such as `f4` and `f5`.
- Applied square transformations to accentuate non-linear relationships, especially for `f18` and `f20`, which could reveal more complex patterns associated with software defects.
- Used cube transformation to further enhance the effect of `f18`, potentially capturing extreme values.
- Limited the number of transformations to avoid excessive complexity while attempting to improve predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:57:00,088 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, I'll combine and enhance the transformations by considering utility, potential interpretability, and computational feasibility. I'll select and transform features in a way that could provide more meaningful insights and performance improvements in prediction tasks. 

Here's the enhanced feature set:

- [f0, f1, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19]
- [f9 square, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal]
- [f0 reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal]
- [f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal]
- [f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal]
- [f11 sqrt, f9 minmax_scaler, f9 cos]
- [f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal]
- [f4 quan_trans, f6 sigmoid]
- [f9 cube, f9 minmax_scaler reciprocal, f9 cos reciprocal]
- [f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f9 minmax_scaler reciprocal reciprocal, f9 cos reciprocal reciprocal] 
- [f9 square reciprocal, f9 cube reciprocal]
- [f4 log, f6 sin]
- [f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal]

This enhanced set adds complexity strategically with additional reciprocal transformations and retains useful operations like minmax scaling, squaring, and additional reciprocal layers, which could capture more intricate relationships in the data that aids predictive modeling.

- Log transformations (`log`) have been applied to some features like f4, f5, f6, and others, as it can help manage wide ranges into more condensed ones and reveal multiplicative relationships, potentially uncovering additional structure.
- Square root transformations (`sqrt`) are applied to a few features to further explore non-linear relationships while reducing redundancy from excessive reciprocal transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:57:20,661 - INFO - llm output = To create a new and improved feature set based on the two given examples, I will incorporate the transformations used in both examples, as well as explore a potential improvement by introducing additional transformations. The latter feature set example includes the transformation of \(f4\) with a sigmoid function, which is an enhancement over the first example. We can build upon this by adding other transformations that could be beneficial for the prediction task.

Here's a new, improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f4 sigmoid ,f5 log ,f6 sqrt]
```

In this new feature set:
- The reciprocal and higher-order reciprocal transformations are carried over from both examples for features \(f0\) to \(f3\), and \(f20\).
- The sigmoid transformation for \(f4\) from the latter example is included.
- Additional transformations are added:
  - A log transformation is applied to \(f5\), which can help normalize features with wide ranges or skewed distributions.
  - A square root transformation is applied to \(f6\), which can help in reducing skewness and handling non-linear relationships.

This new feature set includes multiplicative interactions between features not present in prior sets (e.g., `f6 f7 *`), introduces log transformation (`f18 log`), and reintroduces squared transformations on selective features (`f6 square` and `f7 square`) to capture non-linear relationships potentially linked to software defects. The multiplicative interaction between squared features is designed to emphasize non-linear contributions in collaborative feature spaces.

```

In this new feature set:

1. Added `sigmoid` transformation to `f4`, `f17`, and `f18` since sigmoid brings nonlinear transformations which may help capture complex patterns.
2. Introduced `log` transformation to `f5` and `f19`, which can help with features that might be heavily skewed.
3. Used `reciprocal` transformation on several features to handle relationships between small values.
4. Added `sqrt` and `tanh` transformations to various features for nonlinear scaling and normalization.
5. Combined transformations such as `reciprocal sqrt` and `log reciprocal` to intensify the effect of transformations.

This combined feature set utilizes diverse transformations across the features, aiming to capture different patterns and relationships that might exist in the defect prediction scenario.

**Explanation:**

1. **Log Transformation** for Halstead operators and operands (`f4`, `f5`, `f6`): This transformation is particularly useful for handling skewed data distributions by compressing the range of values, which is often beneficial in regression models.
   
2. **Reciprocal Transformation** on `f10` (Halstead effort): It helps adjust the scale while highlighting smaller values more significantly, potentially improving the model's sensitivity to variations in effort levels.

3. **Cube Transformation** on `f12` (Halstead line count): This nonlinear transformation can emphasize large interactions between variables, highlighting modules with significantly longer code lines.

These transformations aim to retain significant variation and complexity from the original data while introducing nonlinearity and scale adjustments that could help capture patterns relevant to defect prediction more effectively.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Key adjustments:
1. Removed excessive nested reciprocal transformations and focused on varying depths to maintain diversity without excessive depth.
2. Added logarithm, square, and square root transformations to capture distributional differences.
3. Introduced minmax_scaler and stand_scaler transformations for normalization and standardization to address scale differences.
4. Ensured a mix of original, transformed, and scaled features to maintain robustness and relevance for predictive modeling.

2026-01-12 14:57:57,599 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! To create a useful new feature set, I'll aim for a combination of transformations that can help capture complex relationships within the dataset while ensuring computational efficiency. Let's incorporate a mixture of scaling, reciprocal, and nonlinear transformations to enhance feature representation:

[f0 ,f5 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f12 ,f16 ,f18 ,f19 ,f5 square ,f8 square ,f12 square ,f16 square ,f18 square ,f19 square ,f7 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f7 reciprocal ,f8 reciprocal ,f9 reciprocal ,f12 reciprocal ,f19 reciprocal ,f5 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f12 tanh ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f8 sigmoid ,f12 sigmoid ,f4 log ,f5 log ,f8 log ,f12 log ,f7 reciprocal sin ,f8 reciprocal sin ,f9 reciprocal sin ,f12 reciprocal sin ,f5 square tanh ,f8 square tanh] 

This feature set utilizes a combination of basic features with square, square roots, reciprocal, tanh, and sigmoid transformations, and it also applies min-max scaling and logarithmic transformations to additional features. These enhancements intend to increase the predictive power by capturing nonlinear relationships and ensuring that features are on comparable scales, thus enhancing downstream model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

In this feature set, I've added an additional transformation to `f4` using `quan_trans` and introduced a `reciprocal` transformation for `f5`. These transformations should help in capturing more nuanced variations in these features, potentially leading to better predictive performance.

[f0 ,f1 ,f3 ,f5 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f12 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f19 ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal ,f5 sqrt reciprocal ,f9 sqrt reciprocal ,f12 sqrt reciprocal ,f16 sqrt reciprocal ,f7 cube ,f8 cube ,f9 cube ,f9 sqrt cube ,f12 sqrt cube ,f19 sqrt cube ,f7 sin ,f8 sin ,f9 sin ,f3 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f5 log ,f8 cos ,f16 cos ,f9 sin cos ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f12 quan_trans ,f7 sigmoid ,f10 sigmoid]

Key improvements:
1. Use transformations (sqrt, reciprocal, cube, etc.) on more features to capture non-linear relationships.
2. Include a combination of basic operations (cos, tanh, sin) on transformed features for potentially enhanced patterns.
3. Add scaled features (stand_scaler, minmax_scaler) to aid in normalization and handle different feature ranges.
4. Use reciprocal transformations multiple times to capture detailed variations.
5. Incorporate `quan_trans`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh` transformations to explore additional spaces derived from logistic shapes and hyperbolic function behaviors, potentially improving decision boundaries.

- Added transformations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to f7 and f8 for standardization and normalization purposes.
- Included `log`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` transformations on f5, f6, and f4 to capture non-linear relationships and reduce skewness.
- Added `square` and `sqrt` transformations for f4 and f5 to incorporate polynomial relationships among features.

2026-01-12 14:58:22,357 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets you've shared, it seems like the goal is to engineer more informative features through a combination of reciprocal transformations and deeper layers of recursive transformations. The second feature set has incorporated a deeper level of recursion and added some transformations like the cube transformation for a specific feature.

Based on these examples, I'll create a feature set that should offer a richer set of transformations that might capture non-linear relationships even further and potentially offer better predictive power:

In this improved feature set:
- I've maintained the deeper recursive transforms, and added further transformations such as standardized scaling (`stand_scaler`) and sigmoid transformations for some original features to explore linear and non-linear scalings.
- The `cube` and `square` functions have been applied to `f18`, as larger powers might reveal different relationships in data variance.
- Using the `sigmoid` function can help in capturing more non-linear patterns and feature compression which might be useful in some defect prediction contexts.
- By mixing these with the reciprocal recursive patterns found in the second feature set, we strive to capture a wide variety of data distributions and potential predictive patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 14:58:38,546 - INFO - llm output = Taking inspiration from the two feature sets provided, let's aim to create a feature set that balances both the complexity and potential predictive power of derived features, while reducing redundancy:

1. Start with a selection of original features spanning various metrics to ensure coverage and diversity.
2. Apply a mix of mathematical transformations that are known to enhance data variation, such as square and reciprocal, along with statistical transformations like minmax_scaler.
3. Introduce operations that could capture nonlinear relationships (e.g., sin, cube).
4. Ensure novelty by minimizing the extent of recursive or repetitive layering seen in previous examples.

Here's a proposed improved feature set:

Here is an improved feature set:

```

```

**Explanation:**

- **Log Transformation (`f4 log`)**: This can help with skewed data and emphasize differences in smaller values.
- **Square Root (`f7 sqrt`)**: Helps stabilize variance.
- **Cube (`f8 cube`)**: Captures nonlinear relationships that might exist in the data.
- **Sigmoid (`f10 sigmoid`)**: Bounds values between 0 and 1 and can help distinguish probabilities in classification tasks.
- **Hyperbolic Tangent (`f6 tanh`)**: Provides a smoothed output, useful in controlling data ranges in certain modeling scenarios. 

These additional transformations are chosen with the goal of capturing and emphasizing potentially complex boundaries between classes and stabilizing feature distributions for better downstream analysis.

Key modifications and additions:

1. Use a combination of basic arithmetic operations followed by reciprocal transformations which might capture interactions between certain features better.
2. Utilized `log` on complex feature interactions since logarithmic transformations can help manage skewness and reveal multiplicative relationships.
3. Implemented `cube` transformation to K-level depth features which might expose non-linear behavior in some traits.
4. Integrating `cos` and `tanh` transformations on combinations which can help in introducing non-linear interactions.
5. Retained statistical transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler`, which are useful to normalize features based on their distributions.

These transformations should provide a richer set of features for the downstream task of software defect prediction.

Let's aim to utilize mathematical transformations and scalable techniques that might capture the non-linear relationships between features and defects:

**Justification:**
- **Reciprocal and Log Transformations:** These handle skewness, especially for features with large ranges. Transforming them can highlight patterns in data that are nonlinear or need normalization.
  
- **Square and Tanh Transformations:** Squaring and hyperbolic tangent are useful for exploring polynomial and non-linear relationships in the data.

- **Scaling (Min-Max and Standard Scaler):** Ensures features are on comparable scales, improving convergence rates during training and enabling models to learn effectively.

- **Interactions and Combinations:** Multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction between select features can capture interactions that single features might miss.

- **Trigonometric Functions (cos and sin):** These are creative non-linear transformations that, while generally less interpretable, can sometimes capture periodic behavior or complex relationships. 

This feature set emphasizes capturing diverse transformations and interactions to improve models' predictive abilities by providing a rich feature space.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2026-01-12 14:59:23,286 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature set examples, we can enhance the feature set by focusing on transformations that may better highlight relationships indicative of software defects. Here is a new feature set that attempts to build on the transformations provided and aims to capture more complex relationships among the original features:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 cube, f11 sigmoid, f9 cos, f3 stand_scaler, f20 sqrt, f6 minmax_scaler, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f11 tanh, f9 reciprocal reciprocal, f11 cos reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f11 sigmoid reciprocal reciprocal, f5 log, f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f9 cube reciprocal, f11 sigmoid reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f6 stand_scaler reciprocal, f9 cube reciprocal reciprocal, f20 sqrt reciprocal, f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal]

This feature set includes a mix of statistical scalers (stand_scaler and minmax_scaler) and mathematical transformations like reciprocal, sqrt, log, and cube, applied to various features to try to capture their interactions and variations better. It also utilizes trigonometric functions and sigmoid transformation for potentially capturing non-linear relationships. The choice of which feature to transform is informed by those that may contribute more heavily to software defects (like complexity measures), based on typical defect predictors seen in code analysis.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 14:59:35,213 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the provided feature sets, we can focus on adding more meaningful transformations that can capture deeper relationships between features and their interactions. The goal is to introduce transformations that might reveal hidden patterns related to software defects and increase the predictive capability of our model. Let's focus on capturing some non-linear relationships and scaling the features appropriately.

Here's an improved feature set based on the previous ones:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 quan_trans, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal, f0 reciprocal reciprocal, f1 reciprocal reciprocal, f2 reciprocal reciprocal, f3 reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal, f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f11 quan_trans, f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, (f6 square + f7 cube) minmax_scaler, tanh(f8), log(f5 + 1), sqrt(f4 + f19)]
```

New additions:

1. **(f6 square + f7 cube) minmax_scaler**: This transformation takes the square of one feature and the cube of another, then scales it to the [0,1] range, emphasizing non-linear interactions and potential cumulative impacts.

2. **tanh(f8)**: Applying the hyperbolic tangent function can help capture non-linearities and stabilize the feature range between [-1, 1].

3. **log(f5 + 1)**: Log transformation is often used to reduce skewness, particularly for features that might have a heavy-tailed distribution.

4. **sqrt(f4 + f19)**: Square root transformation can also help in normalizing data, particularly in combination with features summing together to capture aggregate effects.

These transformations aim to enhance the predictive model's ability to distinguish between defective and non-defective modules, exploring various interactions and distributions that may be crucial for accurate predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:59:39,983 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, let's focus on enhancing the diversity of transformations, incorporating relevant operations that can capture non-linear relationships or interactions between features. Here's the improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal, f0 square, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, f5 square, f20 square, f0 reciprocal reciprocal, f1 reciprocal reciprocal, f2 reciprocal reciprocal, f3 reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal, f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, sqrt f18, sqrt f20, log f7, log f9, stand_scaler f8, minmax_scaler f10, tanh f11]
```

### Key Enhancements:
1. **Square**: Adding squares of key features (f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f20) can help capture higher-order interactions.
2. **Sqrt**: Applying square root transformations to f18 and f20 to manage potential skewness and reduce dimensional effects intuitively.
3. **Log**: Using logarithmic transformations on features like f7 and f9, common for handling skewed distributions, to enhance interpretability and variance stabilization.
4. **Scaler Transformations**: Including stand_scaler and minmax_scaler to f8 and f10 respectively, enabling normalization and enabling algorithms sensitive to feature scales.
5. **Non-linear Transformations**: Applying tanh on f11 integrates non-linear transformation, potentially valuable for capturing complex patterns.
