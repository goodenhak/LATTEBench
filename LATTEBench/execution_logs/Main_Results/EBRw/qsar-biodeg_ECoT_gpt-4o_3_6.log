```

In this feature set:

- We retain a variety of the basic features (\(f0\) through \(f40\)) for dimensional robustness.
- We include mathematical operations such as square, division, multiplication, and tanh, which are common in the examples.
- Added exploratory transformations such as: 
  - `f22 sqrt` to gauge different scales of transformations based on the example's common operations.
  - `f0 log` in case there are any multiplicative relationships at different concentrations in the data.
  - `f1 f22 tanh` to chain transformations in a way that might highlight nonlinear interactions.
  - `f14 f38 *` to explore interactions between different features.
  - `f29 reciprocal` to examine inverse relationships.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Explanation:**
- **Tanh** transformation on `f32` allows for more non-linear transformation, which might capture complex relationships better.
- Introducing **sinh** transformations adds a different non-linear aspect to `f21` and `f26`, complementing tanh and log transofmrations.
- The interaction `f3 f13 / f29 *` introduces division into existing interactions to allow different scaling effects, which might help differentiate between the biodegradable classes.
- The choices on which terms to apply transformations to (like `tanh`, `log`, `sinh`) or interactions via `*` or `/` are based on observation of the original feature mappings and statistical distribution, aiming to provide diverse nonlinear transformations and capture synergies in the data.

This feature set is designed to bring in non-linear characteristics while maintaining a balance with linear operations to manage complex patterns effectively.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:35:09,663 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we can combine different transformations and select features that are likely to capture complex patterns in the data. A good approach is to use a mix of nonlinear transformations along with scaling and logarithmic transformations for the original features. Here is an improved example:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 tanh ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f29 minmax_scaler ,f7 cube sin ,f38 log sin ,f22 cube ,f14 log log ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f17 stand_scaler ,f21 stand_scaler ,f26 stand_scaler ,f35 stand_scaler ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f11 tanh ,f13 tanh ,f19 tanh ,f23 tanh ,f27 tanh ,f33 tanh ,f37 tanh ,f7 sin cube ,f38 cos ,f14 log sqrt ,f15 sqrt ,f38 sqrt]
```

This set offers a diverse range of transformations to capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between features, such as:
- Using `tanh`, `sin`, `cube`, `log`, and `sqrt` for nonlinear transformations.
- Applying `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize and scale the data, improving model performance.
- Combining multiple transformations to create complex feature interactions, like `f7 cube sin` and `f38 log sin`.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:35:33,442 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions and generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we can add more meaningful transformations and combinations that might capture additional information. I'll build upon the latter example, adding complexity to potentially boost model performance:

- Include a variety of transformations and utilize combinations that may reveal nonlinear relationships.
- Maintain a balanced feature set; avoid redundancy, and ensure each feature provides unique information.

Here's an improved feature set:

```

Key enhancements:

- Added a mix of basic arithmetic combinations, exponential and logarithmic transformations (e.g., `f14 sqrt`, `f38 log square`).
- Incorporated trigonometric transformations to capture potential periodic patterns (`f7 f17 sin`, `f4 f38 cos`).
- Utilized scaling transformations (`f14 f6 - minmax_scaler`, `f38 f6 - minmax_scaler`) for better normalization.
- Added sigmoid transformations due to their common use in statistical significance and neural networks (`f21 f14 sigmoid`).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Diverse Transformations:** I've retained a variety of transformations, including `log`, `square`, `cos`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and added new ones like `cube` and `reciprocal` to capture different aspects of the data.

2. **Combining Features:** I've added a combination that involves operations on features (`f22 sqrt f30 sqrt +`), which allows the model to capture interactions between different features.

3. **Expanded Set:** Ensuring more features are included with scaling (`stand_scaler`), especially for those that were previously impactful.

These enhancements aim to increase feature expressiveness, potentially improving model predictions by revealing non-obvious patterns and relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The latter example applies various transformations including trigonometric functions, logarithms, and others. Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f19 ,f21 ,f22 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 cube ,f7 quan_trans ,f7 sin ,f29 square ,f14 log ,f38 log ,f7 square ,f0 sin ,f1 sin ,f2 sin ,f4 sin ,f5 sin ,f6 sin ,f8 sin ,f9 sin ,f10 sin ,f11 sin ,f12 sin ,f13 sin ,f16 sin ,f17 sin ,f18 sin ,f19 sin ,f20 sin ,f21 sin ,f23 sin ,f24 sin ,f25 sin ,f26 sin ,f27 sin ,f28 sin ,f30 sin ,f31 sin ,f32 sin ,f33 sin ,f34 sin ,f35 sin ,f36 sin ,f37 sin ,f39 sin ,f40 sin ,f7 cube sin ,f7 quan_trans sin ,f7 sin sin ,f29 square sin ,f14 log sin ,f38 log sin ,f7 square sin, f0 sqrt, f1 tanh, f2 reciprocal, f3 log, f15 minmax_scaler, f22 stand_scaler, f6 cube, f7 sqrt, f22 tanh]
```

This new feature set retains the extensive use of trigonometric transformations to capture periodic patterns and adds a variety of transformations including `sqrt`, `tanh`, `reciprocal`, `log`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `cube` for different features. These transformations can help uncover hidden relationships and improve predictive power by allowing models to learn complex interactions and non-linearities more effectively.

2026-01-12 15:36:14,575 - INFO - llm output = In order to create a better feature set from the examples provided, it’s crucial to balance transformations that enhance the expressiveness and separability of data with those that maintain interpretability and computational efficiency. Here is an improved feature set based on the previous examples:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f17, f21 ,f22 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f35 ,f37, f38 ,f40 ,f7 cube ,f7 sqrt, f7 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f14 log ,f38 log, f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f13 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f17 stand_scaler ,f21 stand_scaler ,f24 stand_scaler ,f26 stand_scaler, f30 stand_scaler ,f31 stand_scaler ,f35 stand_scaler ,f37 stand_scaler ,f40 stand_scaler, f7 cube stand_scaler ,f7 sqrt stand_scaler, f29 square stand_scaler ,f14 log stand_scaler ,f38 log stand_scaler, f22 f30 /, f29 sigmoid]
```

**Explanation of Choices:**

1. **Removed Redundancy and Specialized Transforms:** Removed excessive repeated transformations (like multiple sin transformations) to reduce redundancy and computational burden.

2. **Introduced More Stable Transforms:** Used `sqrt` and `tanh` on `f7` to provide different perspectives from `cube`, adding `tanh` transformation for `f8` which is often useful for bounding data.

3. **Maintained Log Transformations and Added Scaling:** Log transforms on select features (`f14`, `f38`) keep their data distributions more Gaussian-like for models that benefit from this. Scaling (standard scaler) was preserved for critical variables to standardize the data distribution.

4. **Preserved Core Transforms:** Retained the direct use of features and key transformations (such as division of `f22` and `f30`, and `sigmoid` on `f29`) that might capture meaningful interactions between features.

These decisions aim to optimize the feature set by enhancing variance where needed while maintaining essential transformations that aid model performance in predicting biodegradability accurately.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Let's aim for balance between complexity and interpretability:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 cube ,f7 quan_trans ,f29 square ,f14 log ,f38 log ,f0 sin ,f1 sin ,f2 sin ,f6 sin ,f8 sin ,f10 sin ,f14 sin ,f17 sin ,f18 sin ,f21 sin ,f23 sin ,f26 sin ,f30 sin ,f35 sin, f7 stand_scaler ,f0 f7 - ,f14 f18 * ,f22 f29 + ,f14 square ,f29 sqrt ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f15 tanh ,f7 cube sin ,f7 quan_trans cube ,f29 square sin, f14 log cube]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection and Removal**: I maintained a comprehensive set of features and removed some redundant transformations while preserving the diversity of transformations applied to original features.

2. **Transformation Diversity**: By including trigonometric transformations (`sin`), logarithmic (`log`), square and cube transformations, the feature set gains potentially nonlinear discriminating features.

3. **Combination and Interaction**: I have added interactions between features that could provide insights into their joint predictive power.

4. **Normalizations and Scalings**: `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are introduced to help normalizing feature distributions for model compatibility, followed by subsequent cube and sin transformations to capture nonlinearities in potentially scaled features.

This feature set maintains a balance between introducing complex transformations and keeping the operations practical for interpretation and downstream tasks, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

We'll apply a combination of transformations and operations that better capture the non-linear relationships within the data and improve the model's ability to classify the chemicals.

Feature engineering based on the examples provided includes using a variety of mathematical transformations such as quantile transformations, non-linear scaling, and basic arithmetic operations to generate new features. Let us use a diverse set of transformations to the original features:

```

### Explanation:
1. **Combination of Transformations**: 
   - _Quantile transformation_: Applied multiple times on the same feature to amplify useful non-linear orderings.
   - _Min-max scaling_, _standard scaling_, and other typical transformations are applied across many features to ensure the features are normalized and standardized correctly, regardless of their distribution.
   
2. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - _sqrt_: Applied to a notably distributed feature to assist with scale variation.
   - _cube_: Applied for enhancing non-linear effects to preserve extreme deviations.
   
3. **Complex Interactions**:
   - Feature interactions using arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and division across distinct features could potentially reveal relationships between descriptors that weren't captured before. 

4. **Improved Feature Diversity**:
   - By adding combinations and transactions never seen before, we enrich the feature space, increasing the potential for distinguishing patterns and increasing predictive performance.

This new feature set is tailored to capture non-linear relationships and interactions and improve the classification of chemicals into biodegradable classes.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Considering both the richness of transformations and the variety of operations, here is a new feature set that builds upon the provided examples:

```

In this set:
- I prioritized transformations that provide diverse representations (e.g., square, sqrt, reciprocal, log, tanh).
- Integrated combinations of the existing feature transformations and added interactions between them (e.g., `f38 f8 *`, `f14 f38 / f8`).
- Added specialized transformations (e.g., `cube`, `quan_trans`) to introduce non-linear behavior.
- Maintained normalization techniques (e.g., `stand_scaler`) for robustness across different scales.

This new feature set aims to capture more complex relationships and non-linear interactions while ensuring computational feasibility and interpretability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, I've incorporated both standard transformations, such as `sqrt`, `sin`, and `tanh`, and scaling operations with specific attention to the features that seemed less represented before. The inclusion of trigonometric functions and scaling should help capture non-linear relationships and normalize the data, respectively.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Key points:
- Utilize a mix of mathematical transformations (logarithm, square, cube, square root) and trigonometric transformations (tanh, cos).
- Use operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) between certain transformed features, enhancing non-linearity and interaction capture.
- Application of reciprocal as a feature transformation for `f29` to incorporate its inverse effect.
- Balance between reduction of dimensionality using subtraction and creation of compounded features with multiplication.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**New Additions:**
- Included `f39 reciprocal` to potentially capture inverse relationships.
- Applied `f40 sqrt stand_scaler` for potential nonlinear scaling transformations.
- Combined features using multiplication `f22 f30 *` instead of division to explore different interactions and relationships.
- Used `f14 sigmoid` transformation to test capturing nonlinear patterns in `f14`.

By employing these transformations, the goal is to find a more expressive feature set that better characterizes the chemicals for the biodegradability classification task.

In this feature set, we've preserved valuable transformations like square, sqrt, and log, combining them with scaling techniques such as `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`. Additionally, we've utilized interactions and element-wise operations like reciprocal and addition with key variables and built upon significant transformations that may enhance model predictions, using sigmoid functions on meaningful operations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:38:05,901 - INFO - llm output = Feature engineering through transformation can aid in improving the predictive power of machine learning models by introducing non-linearity and scaling the data appropriately. Let's design a new feature set that leverages both feature transformations and interactions to maximize predictive performance. Here's my attempt based on your examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f29 sin ,f7 sqrt ,f8 cos ,f10 tanh ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f30 tanh ,f17 stand_scaler ,f21 stand_scaler ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 square ,f5 cube ,f9 log ,f13 log ,f19 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f24 cube ,f25 sigmoid ,f26 square ,f34 tanh ,f35 tanh]
```

**Explanation of selected transformations:**

1. **Basis Features**: Retain all original features for reference and original scale.
   
2. **Square Root Transformation**: Applied to `f0`, `f1`, `f7`, and `f2` to compress large values and make distributions more normal-like.

3. **Trigonometric Transformations**: Used `sin` for periodicity introduction in `f29`, `cos` for `f8`, and `tanh` for `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f6`, `f30` to address potential non-linear relationships.

4. **Standardization**: Applied to `f17`, `f21` ensuring features have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, suited for models sensitive to scale.

5. **Square Transformation**: Amplifies the prominence of `f4`, `f26`, potentially revealing quadratic relationships.

6. **Logarithmic Transformation**: Normalizes skewed data by reducing the impact of large values (`f9`, `f13`).

7. **Cube Transformation**: Enhances non-linear characteristics (`f5`, `f24`), can reveal high-degree polynomial trends.

8. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Inverts values (`f19`, `f20`) persuasive for features with an inverse effect.

9. **Sigmoid Transformation**: Applies soft clamping effects between 0 and 1 for `f25`, ideal for representation akin to probabilities.

By mixing exploratory transformations with established scaling techniques, this new feature set should potentially improve model accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
- Additional transformations such as `log`, `reciprocal`, `cube`, `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, and `cos` are applied to expand the capacity of feature space exploration.
- Combinations involving multiplication, division, and addition create interactions and break down complex patterns into simpler components.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, I've incorporated squares, cubes, logarithms, and both additive and multiplicative interactions to potentially capture nonlinear relationships, complexity, and scale differences among the features. The use of composite features like `f8 f14 sqrt f2 *` extends the exploration of interactions beyond mere summative expressions. Additionally, focusing on transformations such as cube roots and logarithms might highlight specific data trends in the biodata classification task better.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This set balances both feature subtraction and multiplication, integrates non-linear transformations such as `tanh` and `log`, and limits the inclusion of features to key elements and transformations that are more likely to capture complex relationships and interactions between features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Enhancements made:
1. Added `f26 f35 /` to capture interactions between these two features, potentially highlighting dependency or ratio.
2. Introduced `f12 f21 * sin` to explore non-linear relationships that might better model complex interactions.
3. Included `f17 reciprocal` to leverage inverse relationships that could offer insights into the importance of feature scaling.
4. Applied `f38 stand_scaler` for standardizing the range of a potentially pivotal feature, ensuring better comparability.

These transformations are aimed at potentially uncovering hidden relationships and improving model predictions through enriched feature representation.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This new feature set includes several transformations that aim to capture nuanced variations in your data while reducing dimensionality: 

- Log transformations for non-negative features to help normalize skewed data distributions.
- Standard scaling across various features to attain a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
- Reciprocal transformation and tanh function applications to introduce non-linear relationships.
- Operations combining features such as addition, multiplication, and division.
- The inclusion of squared features and minmax_scaler to harness the non-linear scaling between features. 

The goal is to retain meaningful data variations while achieving greater model performance or predictive capacity with these enhanced features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Enhancements include:

1. **Normalization & Standardization**: More features are standardized using `stand_scaler` for improved interpretability and consistent magnitude.

2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Inclusion of varied transformations like `sqrt`, `cos`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, `log`, and `tanh` to capture non-linear relationships.

3. **Combinations & Interactions**: Combined some features with operations like `+`, `*`, and non-linear transforms to capture interactions between features.

These transformations and interactions aim to better capture complex relationships in the data, which can enhance model performance in predictive tasks like classifying chemical biodegradability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
