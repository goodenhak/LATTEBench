2026-01-13 10:51:44,431 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, we can attempt to construct a new feature set that maximizes information while leveraging transformations that enhance prediction power for heart disease. The latter feature set introduces interaction terms and transformations such as sine, sigmoid, and reciprocal, which can capture non-linear relationships potentially relevant for classification tasks like heart disease prediction.

Considering the improvements suggested by the latter feature set, here is a better feature set proposal:

[f2, f8, f9, f10, f2 f4 *, f8 f4 *, f9 f4 *, f10 f4 *, f2 f7 -, f8 f7 -, f2 f4 * sin, f8 f4 * sin, f9 f4 * sin, f10 f4 * sin, f3 f4 + cube f7 -, f2 sigmoid, f8 f7 - reciprocal, f9 f7 - reciprocal, f2 f4 * f7 - reciprocal, f8 f4 * f7 - reciprocal, f8 sin, f10 sin, f9 tanh, f2 f7 - f2 f4 * f7 - /, f8 f7 - f8 f4 * f7 - /]

Key considerations in this feature set:
- Use of \(\text{sin}\) and \(\text{tanh}\) transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Maintenance of interaction terms (\(f2 f4 *\), \(f8 f4 *\), \(f9 f4 *\), \(f10 f4 *\)) that might reveal indirect associations through multiplied physiological attributes.
- Inclusion of reciprocal transformations to adjust for scaling effects and possible inverse relationships.
- We've kept more direct non-linear transformations similar to sigmoid, which often helps in binary classification tasks such as predicting heart disease presence.
- Excluded excessive cubic transformations to reduce potential noise whilst retaining cubes where they interact with either addition or subtraction components related to key predictors, like \(trestbps\) and \(thalach\). 

This set should offer more comprehensive insights while considering both interaction effects and individual transformations steered towards capturing complex patterns in cardiovascular assessments.

2026-01-13 10:51:58,782 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets, the latter one is better, and we'll build upon it to create an improved feature set. The goal is to enhance the representation of features to aid in predictive modeling for heart disease detection.

Let's integrate and enhance the transformations from the previous sets:

1. Utilize interaction terms for deeper insights.
2. Incorporate additional scaling and transformation methods to normalize and enhance features.
3. Ensure broad feature representation by transforming multiple original features.

Here's the improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f3 f4 / ,f7 f4 / ,f7 f3 * ,f3 f8 / ,f3 quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans ,f3 cos ,f7 cos ,f5 sigmoid ,f9 cube ,f10 sqrt ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f4 log minmax_scaler ,f8 tanh minmax_scaler ,f12 tanh ]
```

### Explanations:
- **Interaction Terms**: Added `f7 f3 *` and `f3 f8 /` to explore multiplicative and divisive interactions which might not be linear.
- **Transformation Enhancements**: Incorporated `f5 sigmoid`, `f9 cube`, and `f10 sqrt` to address potential nonlinearities or skewness. The `sigmoid` can help with probability-like scaling, while `cube` and `sqrt` transformations can model relationships in different scales.
- **Broad Feature Representation**: Scaling (`minmax_scaler`) and transformations (`log`, `tanh`) ensure all features are normalized or transformed to highlight their properties and potential interactions effectively.

2026-01-13 10:52:08,454 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set from the given examples, let's combine some effective operations and transformations while removing redundant or less informative transformations. Here's the improved feature set in postfix notation:

Here's the logic behind the selection:
- Retained core features (`f0` to `f4`, `f7` to `f10`) which are likely important predictors of heart disease.
- Included `cube` and `sqrt` operations for certain features to capture non-linear relationships.
- Added `tanh` and `log` transformations for particular features to handle skewness and range issues.
- Used scaling operations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize the feature values for specific features that might benefit from scaling.
- Removed redundant transformations or combinations that may not add significant predictive value based on the assembled examples.

Here's a new feature set that incorporates aspects from both previous sets with some enhancements:

```
[f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f2 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f7 f9 -, f8 f7 *, f9 f8 /, f1 minmax_scaler f7 -, f1 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f2 log, f8 log, f9 log, f10 log, f5 f8 -, f9 f7 /, f7 tanh, f8 minmax_scaler tanh, f9 minmax_scaler tanh, f10 minmax_scaler tanh]
```

### Explanation of New Feature Set:
1. **Base Features**: Includes f2, f7, f8, f9, and f10 which are useful base features for predictions.

2. **Scaled Features**: Use of `minmax_scaler` on f2, f8, f9, and f10 to normalize these features ensuring they are on a similar scale for analysis.

3. **Further Scaling**: `minmax_scaler minmax_scaler` is applied for double normalization effect on f10, capturing any nuanced shifts in distribution.

4. **Mathematical Transformations**: 
   - Differences: Capture interactions between features such as `f7 f9 -` and `f1 minmax_scaler f7 -`.
   - Products and Ratios: Capture interactions through multiplication and division such as `f8 f7 *` and `f9 f8 /`.
   - Log Transformations: Applying logarithm to f2, f8, f9, and f10 helps in managing skewed data distributions and enhances linear relationships.

5. **Non-linear Transformations**: Use of `tanh`, which can be useful in rescaling and saturating the effects of certain features that might have extreme values, on f7, f8, f9, and f10.

By combining these techniques, the proposed feature set aims to capture linear relationships, manage non-normal distributions, and explore feature interactions that are likely to be useful for predicting heart disease presence.

The given feature sets include a combination of trigonometric transformations, scaling, and basic arithmetic operations. While the two provided examples offer a diverse range of transformations, the latter example incorporates logarithmic transformations directly correlated with distribution normalization—facilitating model interpretability and robustness.

Here's a potentially improved feature set integrating diverse transformations from both examples:

```

Explanation of the chosen transformations: 
1. **Logarithmic transformations** (e.g., `f3 log`, `f7 log`) are specifically useful for reducing skewness and working with features that have exponential growth patterns.
2. **Trigonometric transformations** (e.g., `f8 sin`, `f10 sin`, `f8 sin sin`) capture cyclic patterns and relationships that may be non-linear.
3. **Polynomial transformations** (e.g., `f8 cube`, `f10 cube`) introduce non-linear relationships which can improve model learning if interactions between feature values are complex.
4. **Rooting transformations** (e.g., `f10 cube sqrt`) further normalize the data distribution.
5. **Quantile transformation** (e.g., `f9 quan_trans`) ensures that the feature matches a specific probability distribution, which is useful to improve model assumptions.
  
The selected features aim to enrich the dataset with non-linear, normalized, and distributed-transformed data which can enhance model predictions for complex tasks like heart disease classification.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 10:52:56,908 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, I'll create a new feature set that incorporates transformations and interactions which could potentially capture important patterns and relationships for predicting the presence of heart disease. I'll balance between using some complex interactions and maintaining simpler transformations for interpretability and model performance.

Here's the improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,
 f4 log ,f3 log ,f7 log ,f0 log ,           # From first feature set
 f1 f8 + ,f1 f10 + ,f2 f10 + ,f2 f12 + ,     # From second feature set
 f6 f8 + ,f9 f11 + ,f9 f5 + ,                # Chosen interactions
 f8 f3 log + ,f10 f11 + ,                   # Incorporating logs with interactions
 f0 square ,f1 square ,f8 square ,          # Adding some squared terms
 f8 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler         # Adding min-max scaling for normalization
]
```

This new feature set combines some interactions from both previously provided sets while adding a few transformations that can provide potentially useful nonlinear relationships. Squaring and scaling certain features might help when dealing with neural networks or tree-based models. Additionally, some of the log transformations are preserved due to their utility in mitigating skewness.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:
- **f4 sqrt:** Applying square root transformation can help in stabilizing the variance and can also manage skewed data, which might provide better input for the model.
- **f3 f7 /:** This feature captures the proportion of chest pain relative to age, potentially providing insights into how significant chest pain impacts younger vs. older individuals.
- **f3 f8 /:** This similar transformation considers the effect of maximum heart rate achieved in relation to age.
- **f3 tanh:** Applying the hyperbolic tangent function, which is another form of non-linear transformation, helps in rescaling (between -1 and 1) and can handle outliers effectively.

Key Adjustments and Additions:
- Added features involving both cosine and square of sums, which can capture cyclical patterns and non-linear relationships.
- Included the sigmoid transformation on a frequently appearing feature combination to potentially capture non-linear boundaries and saturation effects.
- Incorporated reciprocal transformation for potential emphasis on feature scaling and reduction.
- Expanded use of existing features with different combinations, aiming for non-linear interaction effects that might better capture the data's underlying complexity.

2026-01-13 10:54:06,020 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, let's create a better feature set by combining transformations that might capture non-linear relationships and interactions effectively:

1. [f0 cos, f2 cos, f8 cos, f9 cos, f10 cos, f12 cos, f0 cos cos, f1 cos cos, f2 cos cos, f5 cos cos, f6 cos cos, f7 cos cos, f8 cos cos, f9 cos cos, f10 cos cos, f11 cos cos, f12 cos cos, f3 cos]
   
This set includes important transformations like cosine and nested cosine transformations to capture more intricate patterns. The inclusion of all features transformed by cosine allows us to capture periodic relationships that could exist in the data. Nested cosine transformations might amplify subtle underlying patterns.

To further enhance this feature set, we can include additional interaction and transformation terms:

2. [f0 cos, f2 cos, f8 cos, f9 cos, f10 cos, f12 cos, f0 cos cos, f1 cos cos, f2 cos cos, f5 cos cos, f6 cos cos, f7 cos cos, f8 cos cos, f9 cos cos, f10 cos cos, f11 cos cos, f12 cos cos, f3 cos, f8 f3 * cos, f2 f6 * cos, f0 f10 * cos, f0 f12 * cos cos, f8 f9 / cos]

Enhancements:
- Added interaction terms: f8 f3 * cos, f2 f6 * cos, f0 f10 * cos, capturing potential synergistic effects of features.
- Nested operations like: f0 f12 * cos cos, to potentially refine and amplify signals.
- Division transformation: f8 f9 / cos helps in normalizing certain interactions while capturing unique patterns.

These transformations should help in capturing underlying relationships in the data that simple linear transformations might miss, thereby potentially improving heart disease prediction accuracy.

2026-01-13 10:54:16,452 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we'll look for ways to engineer features that could capture important interactions and transformations, making the predictive model more powerful. When creating feature sets, it's essential to consider both non-linear transformations and potential interactions among the different features. Here’s a newly engineered feature set based on the given examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, 
 f4 log, f3 log, f7 log, f5 log,

 f4 f6 + sqrt, 
 f3 log f10 sqrt, 
 f3 f4 + f10 sqrt, 
 f6 f7 * f9 +, 
 f6 log, f9 log]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Log Transformations**: Applied to `f3`, `f4`, `f5`, `f7` where a log transformation could help normalize skewed data.
2. **Square Root Transformations**: Applied to `f10`, `f11`, `f12` to manage range and scale of features.
3. **Pairwise Additions**: Add pairs of features like `f4 f6 +`, `f3 f4 +`, `f7 f9 +` to capture interactions.
4. **Multiplicative Interactions**: Create interaction terms with products such as `f2 f6 *`, `f8 f10 *`.
5. **Divisions**: Including ratios like `f9 f7 /`, `f12 f8 /` to find important relative differences.
6. **Complex Interactions**: Combined transformations such as `f4 f6 + sqrt` and combination of existing transformations like `f3 f4 + f10 sqrt`.
7. **Additional log transformation**: Apply `log` transformation on `f6`, `f9` because they might benefit from normalization.

This set captures a mix of transformations and feature interactions, which can help uncover complex relationships within the data to improve model predictions.

1. Include basic features: f1, f2, f3, f4, f7, f8, f9, f10.
2. Utilize cube transformations for non-linear expansion: f0 cube, f2 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube.
3. Include square root transformation for scaling: f2 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt.
4. Extend interactions by combining original features with transformations:
   - f2 f4 * (interaction term capturing the combined effect of age and cholesterol).
   - f3 f7 / (interaction term examining the ratio of resting blood pressure to maximum heart rate, potentially providing insights into heart strain).
5. Apply the sigmoid function for non-linear transformation beneficial for logistic regression:
   - f2 sigmoid.
6. Utilize trigonometric transformations for potential periodic patterns and additional non-linearities:
   - f8 sin, f9 tanh.
7. Integrate subtraction and multiplication to form more complex interactions:
   - f2 f7 - f2 f4 * f7 - / (captures the difference between age and cholesterol while adjusting for heart rate, divided interaction term).
   - f8 f7 - f8 f4 * f7 - / (captures the difference between another feature and cholesterol while adjusting for heart rate, divided interaction term).

We'll aim to avoid redundancy and promote transformations that could be more insightful for predicting heart disease.

```

Explanation:
- The feature set includes important categorical and numerical features directly.
- The use of `sin`, `tanh`, and `cube` transformations captures non-linearities.
- The `log` and `sqrt` transformations are used for normalizing positive-skewed distributions.
- The interaction terms (e.g., `f8 * f9`) enable exploration of combined effects.
- Scaling methods like `minmax_scaler` ensure that features are on a comparable scale.
- `reciprocal` transformation is used to handle potential outliers.

This feature set balances simplicity with the introduction of derived features that can potentially improve the model's predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

**Explanation of selections:**
- Basic transformations (cube, sqrt) of selected features are included to explore non-linear relationships.
- Multiplicative interactions (`f2 f4 *`, `f8 f4 *`, etc.) consider interactions between blood pressure and other features.
- The use of trigonometric functions and reciprocal transformations aims to capture complex relationships.
- Combined transformations (`f2 f4 * f7 - sqrt`) leverage existing complex interactions but further transformed for potentially better separability.

- f4 log: Applying the logarithm transformation to f4 (serum cholesterol) can help normalize skewness often present in cholesterol levels.

- f10 tanh: Using tanh on f10 (slope of the peak exercise ST segment) helps compress the range and focus variations in slope, which can play a significant role in cardiac health.

These transformations aim to uncover hidden patterns and interactions between features related to heart disease.

2026-01-13 10:55:03,800 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for predicting the presence of heart disease, let's aim to simplify while maintaining or enhancing the features' predictive power. The goal is to integrate useful transformations with a focus on interpretability and connection to the physiology underlying the dataset. Here's the enhanced feature set:

[f8, f10, f8 cos, f10 cos, f4 f8 *, f4 f8 cos *, f10 square, f4 f8 * cos, f4 f8 cos * cos, f4 f8 cos * cos cos, f4 f8 * cos cos, f8 cos cos cos, f8 cos f9 *, f10 cos f4 *, f9 f8 / cos, f8 f10 * cos, f4 f9 cos /, f4 f10 square *, f8 square, f9 cos f10 *, f8 cos f8 * cos, f4 f9 cos * f10 cos, f8 cos f10 square, f4 f8 f10 * cos]

In this proposal:
- Redundant or excessive cosine transformations have been streamlined, retaining those with direct multiplication operations or further squared terms, which might capture nonlinear relationships more effectively.
- Inclusion of essential mathematical interactions between key features: multiplying blood pressure (f4) by heart rate features (f8, f10) suggests a physiological link reflecting potential stress indicators.
- Squared terms of f8 and f10 are retained for non-linear modeling possibilities, which can be quite powerful while maintaining simplicity.
- Hybrids of multiplication and cosine transformations enriched with contextual physiology: like the interaction between exercise-induced angina (f9), maximum heart rate achieved (f10), and blood pressure (f4) further refined.
- Terms that may capture anomalies or rarer physiological interactions via division or more complex combinations included, which might assist the learning model in picking up nuanced signs of disease.

This approach maintains complexity where useful and reduces where unnecessary while emphasizing combinations that could correspond to health markers related to heart disease presence.

2. Include important transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
3. Minimize redundancy by selecting important features once and avoid repeating transformations unnecessarily.

```

Here's a quick explanation of the newly added features:
- `f4 sqrt`: Taking the square root of `f4` could help normalize the distribution if 'f4' data is skewed.
- `f4 log`: Taking the logarithm of `f4` can similarly help stabilize variance and make the data more normal-distribution-like.
- `f9 minmax_scaler`: Scaling `f9` to a 0-1 range helps with algorithms sensitive to scale.
- `f7 log`: Log transformation on `f7` might capture non-linear relationships more effectively.
- `f10 stand_scaler`: Standardizing `f10` to have zero mean and unit variance can be useful if any models assume normally distributed data.
- `f8 tanh`: Applying the hyperbolic tangent to `f8` to map it to the range [-1, 1], which can often improve performance in neural networks or other models that benefit from normalized data.

In this updated feature set, we incorporate various mathematical transformations such as cosine, square, and reciprocal to create derived features. These transformations may uncover non-linear relationships useful for predicting heart disease presence. The combination of multiplicative and additive operations further allows for complex interaction terms, which could represent combined influences of multiple physiological factors in the predictions.

2026-01-13 10:55:43,120 - INFO - llm output = When creating a new and better feature set using transformations provided in postfix format, it is important to consider diversity, usefulness, and how transformations might help capture various relationships within the features. Given the two examples, the latter feature set adds more transformations with sigmoids instead of quantile transformations, which often helps in capturing nonlinear patterns. Let's build a better feature set by integrating previous transformations and incorporating meaningful new ones:

```plaintext
[f2 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f12 ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f1 f4 + ,f6 f4 + ,f8 f4 + ,f12 f4 + ,f4 minmax_scaler f4 + ,f4 square f4 + ,f1 f4 + cos ,f6 f4 + cos ,f9 f4 + cos ,f4 tanh f4 + cos ,f4 minmax_scaler f4 + square ,f4 square f4 + square ,f4 tanh f4 + square ,f1 f4 + square ,f8 f4 + square ,f11 f4 + square ,f12 f4 + square ,f1 f4 + sigmoid ,f5 f4 + sigmoid ,f8 f4 + sigmoid ,f4 square f4 + sigmoid ,f1 f4 + log ,f8 f4 + log ,f9 f4 + log ,f9 stand_scaler f4 + log ,f10 reciprocal f4 + log]
```

This set builds upon the second example by incorporating:

- Logs where appropriate (logs often help with normalization and handling skewed data).
- Standard scaling combined with log to handle diverse distributions.
- Reciprocal helps in stabilizing variance and handling outliers in features with potentially high skewness.

This approach leverages diverse transformations to capture various relationships between features for improved predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2026-01-13 10:55:50,450 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we can synthesize the most relevant transformations and potentially useful combinations. The aim is to retain informative features while possibly reducing redundancy and enhancing interpretability. Let's propose a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f1, f2, f4, f7, f8, f9, f10,

 f8 tanh, f3 log, f4 log, f3 f4 * sqrt]
```

**Explanation:**

1. Retain a range of original and transformed features to cover various potential nonlinear relationships.
2. Incorporate scalers and non-linear transformations like sigmoid, tanh, and logarithm where they might help in normalizing and dealing with non-linearity.
3. Include feature interactions using arithmetic operations, which typically help capture complex relationships.
4. Use advanced transformations like "log" and "sqrt" only with those features that follow log-normal or right-skewed distribution.
5. Maintain focus on features involving ratios (e.g., `f2 f4 /`) which can help in preserving meaningful relationships.
6. Include basic transformations to regularize highly varying features using `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `sigmoid`, for smoothing outliers’ impact.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 10:56:02,225 - INFO - llm output = To improve feature engineering given the examples, let's focus on creating a feature set that combines transformations and operations in a more informative way, possibly enhancing the predictive power of the features for heart disease prediction.

Here's a new feature set that could be a better representation based on the provided examples:

```
[f2 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f4 standard_scaler ,f6 standard_scaler ,f8 log ,f9 log ,f10 log ,f2 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f4 standard_scaler sqrt ,f6 standard_scaler sqrt ,f8 log sqrt ,f9 log sqrt ,f10 log sqrt ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f8 log tanh ,f9 log tanh ,f10 log tanh ,f10 reciprocal ,f8 reciprocal ,f9 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal tanh ,f9 reciprocal tanh ,f8 reciprocal tanh ,f10 reciprocal sqrt ,f9 reciprocal sqrt ,f8 reciprocal sqrt ,f8 reciprocal log ,f9 reciprocal log ,f10 reciprocal log ,f8 standard_scaler sqrt ,f9 standard_scaler sqrt ,f10 standard_scaler sqrt ,f8 standard_scaler tanh ,f9 standard_scaler tanh ,f10 standard_scaler tanh]
```

This feature set includes a combination of standard scaling, logarithmic transformation, square root transformation, tangential hyperbolic transformation, and reciprocal transformations individually and in combination. The use of standard scaling helps in normalizing the feature values to have a common scale, while logarithmic and square root transformations help handle skewness or variance issues. Combining these transformations can potentially uncover more informative representations in the data that might be critical for predicting heart disease.
