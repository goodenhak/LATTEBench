you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:49:12,438 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, I'll attempt to construct a better feature set by combining useful transformations and ensuring diversity in the operations applied. Here is a suggested improved feature set:

```plain text
[f7, f8, f9, f19, f11 stand_scaler, f11 square, f5 sqrt, f5 f11 +, f11 f5 log +, f0 reciprocal, f0 stand_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f18 f1 - cube, f18 f3 - cube, f18 f6 - cube, f5 f18 +, f5 f18 f6 - +, f18 f3 stand_scaler - cube, f11 sqrt, f9 cube, f11 sigmoid, f18 f6 stand_scaler - cube, f11 f12 sigmoid +, f11 f17 sigmoid +, f5 f18 f0 reciprocal stand_scaler - +, f18 f7 - cube]
```

The strategy for this selection includes:

- Retaining essential feature transformations such as `stand_scaler`, `cube`, and `sigmoid` from both previous sets.
- Inclusion of arithmetic combinations that involve informative features and transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Utilization of complex operations like `cube` and `reciprocal` to add non-linear variability.
- Using combinations of features that might have complementary information for defect prediction.

In this new feature set:
- Logarithmic transformations are used to capture multiplicative relationships.
- Square root transformations are used to reduce scale and capture nonlinear relationships.
- Tanh and sigmoid functions help normalize features within a bounded range.
- The use of operations like reciprocal and cube introduce nonlinearity and handle extreme values.
- Various combinations of features use linear operations to capture interactions, potentially improving predictive power.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:49:23,548 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given two feature set examples, I'll try to create a better feature set. The goal is to utilize transformations that might improve the predictive power while focusing on more efficient and potentially meaningful transformations. We'll reduce redundancy while attempting to keep the order of transformation configurations the same.

Here's a possible improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, 
sqrt f0, sqrt f1, sqrt f2, sqrt f3, sqrt f4, sqrt f5, sqrt f6, sqrt f7, sqrt f8, sqrt f9, sqrt f10, 
log f0, log f1, log f5, log f10, 
f4 f5 *, f6 f7 /, f5 f8 *, f9 f10 +, f11 f12 -,
sigmoid f0, sigmoid f1, sigmoid f2, sigmoid f3, sigmoid f20,
f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal]
```

Key modifications:
1. **Applying square root and logarithmic transformations** to potentially stabilize variance and shrink the range.
2. **Using multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction** of select features to introduce interactions that could be predictive.
3. **Using sigmoid transformation** to squeeze feature values into a bounded range. 
4. **Reciprocal transformation** is maintained for key features to capture inverse relationships.

These steps enhance the feature space's descriptive capacity while maintaining computational simplicity and avoiding excessive redundancy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:49:29,379 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two examples provided, it seems that the goal is to create a new feature set that is more comprehensive and potentially more useful for the downstream task of software defect prediction. The second example introduces more transformations such as `stand_scaler`, additional `reciprocal` transformations, and the `cube` operation, which can help capture non-linear relationships in the data. 

To further improve the new feature set, we can introduce even more diverse transformations and combinations, including logarithmic and trigonometric functions. Let's build an enhanced feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 cube ,f9 log ,f7 tanh ,f8 sigmoid ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f20 sqrt ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f4 stand_scaler reciprocal square sqrt ,f6 stand_scaler ,f10 sin ,f12 cos ,f13 tanh ,f14 reciprocal log ,f15 sigmoid ,f16 reciprocal cube ,f17 minmax_scaler sqrt]
```

This set leverages a variety of transformations, including multiple reciprocal operations, scaling, logarithmic transformations, trigonometric operations, and nonlinear transformations with `cube` and `sqrt`, aiming to capture intricate patterns in the dataset. Such diversity in feature engineering can create more representative features that potentially support better predictions in the downstream machine learning task.

  - **Square:** Enhances the impact of existing features that may have a quadratic relationship with the target.
  - **Minmax Scaler and Quantile Transformation:** Used for scaling and normalization to reduce skewness and fit models that require feature scaling.
  - **Tanh:** Provides non-linear transformation useful in capturing complex patterns.

2026-01-12 14:49:41,795 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on given examples, we will merge the ideas from both examples, emphasizing transformations and feature interactions from the latter while including selected meaningful interactions and transformations from the former. We will aim for a richer set that enhances predictive power.

Here's the new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 f9 + ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f11 f5 - ,f11 quan_trans ,f0 f5 * ,f1 f5 * ,f6 f5 * ,f12 f5 * sin ,f10 f5 * sin ,f9 stand_scaler ,f19 quan_trans ,f9 f11 + ,f9 square ,f9 minmax_scaler sin]
```

Explanation:
1. **Base Features**: Retained all original features (`f0` to `f20`).

2. **Useful Interactions and Transformations**: Incorporated reciprocal of essential features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`) focusing on reducing nonlinear relationships which are critical in understanding defects.

3. **Complex Interactions**: Included interactions from the former example such as `f0 f5 *` and `f1 f5 *`, but with focused sine transformations on select features which are likely to capture periodic trends (from `f12` and `f10`). 

4. **Advanced Scaling**: Applied transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` especially to `f9` which appeared in both examples, indicating its relevance.

5. **Transform Variety**: Enhanced transformations with diversity, including quantitative transformation and square/cube transformations, boosting nonlinear understanding.

This blend seeks to harness diverse transformations and interactions, enhancing defect prediction potentially by capturing varied relationships within the data.

```

**Explanation**: 
1. **Logarithm Transformations**: Applying the log function can help stabilize variance and is useful for data with exponential growth patterns.
2. **Square and Square Root**: These are common mathematical transformations that can help in capturing different types of relationships.
3. **Min-Max Scaling**: Provides a normalized scale and makes it easier for models to interpret the data.
4. **Tanh and Sigmoid**: Useful for smooth gradient transitions and capturing non-linear relationships.
5. **Basic Arithmetic Combinations**: This includes simple additions and subtractions to capture interactions between features that might be relevant.
6. **Trigonometric Functions**: Using sine and cosine can be useful for periodic or oscillatory behavior in data.

This feature set aims to leverage a diverse array of transformations and combinations that could potentially be more informative for the modeling task.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Add Log Transformations**: Logarithms can help in handling features with a large range and skewed distributions, potentially aiding linear model performance.

2. **Add Cube Transformations**: Including cubes can introduce non-linear relationships, which might be useful for capturing complex patterns in the data.

By incorporating these transformations, the new feature set aims to balance between handling numerical ranges effectively and exploring non-linear relationships, which could enhance model performance on predicting software defects.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mix of Original Features with Transformations:** Retaining the original features `f0` to `f20` ensures no loss of potentially important raw information. Applying transformations such as `minmax_scaler`, `log`, and `sqrt` normalizes and adjusts the scale appropriately, allowing algorithms to converge better.

2. **Use of Reciprocal Transformation:** Applying `reciprocal` multiple times increases feature complexity and can help in detecting linear dependencies, essentially allowing the model to capture subtle variations.

3. **Use of Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Transformations:** Operations such as `sin`, `cos`, and `tanh` bring in periodic and non-linear perspectives which can be particularly useful for capturing interactions and improving non-linear decision boundaries.

4. **Cross-Feature Interactions:** Combining features with operations like subtraction, multiplication, and transformations afterward increases the model's ability to learn intricate patterns, possibly capturing latent relationships that are not apparent in individual features.

5. **Higher-Order Transformations:** Using `cube`, `square`, and combinations helps to create features that can explain variances better and pick up potential non-linear associations with the target.

Following these principles should render the feature set more robust and able to improve the predictability for software defect predictions in your KC1 dataset.

2026-01-12 14:50:08,044 - INFO - llm output = There are several interesting transformations in your examples that aim to expand the feature space using nonlinear transformations. Considering the suggestions provided and aiming to create a potentially better feature set, we can enhance and extend feature decomposition as follows:

- Include more nonlinear transformations for selected features that seem critical, focusing on both Halstead and McCabe metrics, which are central to the task.
- Expand usage of transformations like `cube` and `log` which can capture polynomial relationships and reduce skew in distributions, respectively.
- Integrate complex transformations like `reciprocal`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `sin`, which can help to emphasize certain nonlinear relationships present in the data.

Here is a proposed feature set based on the examples provided:

This improved feature set:
- Adds more complexity through higher-order terms (`cube`) and interaction terms (`reciprocal`), which can capture nonlinear relationships more comprehensively.

### Explanation:
- **Logarithmic and Square Root Transformations**: These are often used to manage skewed distributions, especially with features like Halstead volume and difficulty that can be quite large and skewed.
- **Standard Scaler and Min-Max Scaler**: Helps in normalizing the data, making features comparable in scale.
- **Sin, Cos, Tanh, Cube Transformations**: These add non-linear transformations that might capture complex patterns in the data.
- **Combination Operations**: Adding operations that create new interactions between features (e.g., `(f0 + f4) sqrt`) introduce a new form, which might capture complex relationships.

These transformations are intended to explore different domains and scales of feature space, ensuring that the predictive model has a diverse set of features to work with.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:50:21,793 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, the second example tends to have a simpler structure, making better use of reciprocal transformations across a broader set of original features. To create an even more effective new feature set that might improve predictions, the focus will be on augmenting the representation by including meaningful interactions and transformations:

- Include more reciprocal transformations for features that are potentially impactful and not yet considered.
- Add logarithmic transformations to capture potential non-linear effects.
- Use minmax_scaler for normalizing features, especially when exploring interactions between them.

Here's a new feature set based on the previous examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

 f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f20 minmax_scaler]
```

This feature set includes reciprocal and logarithmic transformations for important features, as well as min-max scaling, which will help in handling features with different ranges and potentially improve model performance by capturing varied data patterns.

2026-01-12 14:50:26,826 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, I can create a new feature set that builds on them while incorporating additional transformations to potentially improve predictive power. The goal is to explore various transformations that might capture non-linear relationships in the data. Here's a new feature set:

```

In this new feature set, in addition to the existing transformations, I've introduced trigonometric and other non-linear transformations applied to the reciprocal of certain features to provide richer representations. These transformations can potentially capture complex patterns that are useful for defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:50:32,583 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets provided, the second one appears to be better as it incorporates a wider range of original features and transformations, including operations like `tanh`, which can effectively capture non-linear relationships.

To improve upon the second set, we can consider the inclusion of additional transformations that might help uncover more complex relationships in the data. Here's a proposed feature set:

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 square ,f1 square ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f6 square ,f7 square ,f8 square ,f10 square ,f12 square ,f13 square ,f14 square ,f15 square ,f16 square ,f17 square ,f18 square ,f19 square ,f20 square ,f9 tanh ,f5 sqrt ,f4 log ,f7 reciprocal ,f8 sigmoid ,f10 cube ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f3 cos]

This feature set includes:

- Standard transformations like square, sqrt, and tanh from the original set, preserving the benefits it provides.
- Added transformations such as sqrt, reciprocal, log, sigmoid, cube, and cos, which can uncover more sophisticated patterns or interactions within the data.
- Utilization of scaling and normalization techniques (`minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler`) on certain features to manage feature variance and alignment.

This approach is aimed at enhancing model performance by increasing feature diversity, potentially resulting in more accurate defect predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 14:50:38,219 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set from the given examples, I will consider the operations used, their transformation complexity, and the potential for highlighting relationships relevant to prediction tasks. The second feature set already introduces additional cosine, cube, and square root operations, enhancing the transformation complexity. I will build upon that by incorporating more diverse transformations, focusing on non-linear relationships and normalization strategies:

```
[f0 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 quan_trans ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f9 cos ,f9 cube ,f9 sqrt ,f5 reciprocal sqrt ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f5 minmax_scaler reciprocal ,f9 cos reciprocal ,f9 cos cube ,f5 log minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt reciprocal minmax_scaler ,f0 stand_scaler ,f3 tanh sqrt]
```

Changes made:
1. Added diverse transformations like `tanh` and `log` to capture potential non-linear relationships.
2. Incorporated `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` on specific transformed features to improve numerical stability and model convergence.
3. Added complex combinations of transformations, such as `f9 cos cube` and `f9 sqrt reciprocal minmax_scaler`, to provide depth to the feature set.
4. Integrated `reciprocal sqrt` and `log minmax_scaler` operations for varied normalization and transformation perspectives.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, the transformations using `sqrt` of the reciprocals can help further capture and mitigate the effects of extremely small or large values in the data, possibly revealing underlying patterns related to defects. It's essential to ensure that these additional features contribute meaningfully to prediction accuracy when evaluated with appropriate model validation techniques.

```

**Changes Made**:
1. Retained the use of multiple nonlinear transformations on `f9`, which appears to be a high-dimensional and varied feature based on its range and previously chosen transformations (`tanh`, `sigmoid`, `quan_trans`, `sin`).
2. Added a few more transformations to `f9` (`cos`, `reciprocal`, `log`) for capturing potentially informative nonlinear relationships without assuming linearity.
3. Consolidated squares of multiple features to account for quadratic relationships, which often capture interactions or effects not evident with linear terms alone.
4. Removed some redundant operations to maintain efficiency and avoid overfitting while still capturing a wide range of transformations.

2026-01-12 14:51:00,901 - INFO - llm output = To develop a more effective feature set based on the two given examples, we will combine elements and make transformations to improve the prediction model. Here's a proposed feature set:

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 quan_trans ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal ,f5 f5 * ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f9 f9 sqrt ,f9 f5 sin ,f9 f3 reciprocal ,f9 f5 sigmoid ,f4 sin ,f9 sqrt ,f9 f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f9 f5 sigmoid reciprocal ,f9 f5 sigmoid reciprocal reciprocal]

In this improved feature set:

1. All original features f0 through f20 are retained for completeness in capturing raw data characteristics.
2. Transformations such as reciprocal, reciprocal reciprocal, reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal are calculated for selected features (f0, f1, f2, f3, f20) to capture non-linear relationships and their extended influence.
3. Operations involving f9 (such as quan_trans, sqrt, sin, reciprocal, sigmoid) are included for exploring non-linear transformations and potential patterns.
4. Additional combined interactions between features are kept (such as f9 f5 *, f9 f3 reciprocal, f9 f5 sin) to emphasize inter-feature relations.
5. Scalings like minmax_scaler enhance normalization processes, making features more comparable and potentially improving model robustness.

This setup leverages previous feature constructions and introduces additional derivations aimed at improving the prediction accuracy.

Here’s an explanation of some transformations:
- Added transformations such as `tanh` and `cube` for added non-linearity.
- Combined operations such as reciprocal and square with postfixed elements, aiming to build new interactions.
- Included `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` in combination with arithmetic operations to ensure scaling impacts non-linear dimensions.
- Considered inter-feature interactions with operations like division and addition to expose relationships. 

This feature set aims to expand upon the depth and coverage of possible interactions and transformations while keeping in mind model readiness for learning.

This set introduces variations by combining various transformations such as `sqrt`, `tanh`, and scaling along with reciprocal operations to potentially better capture interactions and behavior within the data. The use of scaling and nonlinear transformations can help reveal underlying patterns that were not evident with linear transformations alone.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:51:19,687 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon the feature sets you've provided, we'll try to apply some transformations that can capture more complex relationships and non-linearities in the data. Below is a new feature set suggestion that combines various transformations to potentially enhance the prediction task:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

 f0 reciprocal reciprocal log, f1 reciprocal reciprocal log, f2 reciprocal reciprocal log, f3 reciprocal reciprocal log, f20 reciprocal reciprocal log]
```

### Explanation of Transformations:
1. **Reciprocal followed by square root**: This transformation can help in stabilizing variance and reducing skewness in highly skewed features.
   
2. **Reciprocal reciprocal followed by square**: This transformation is aimed at capturing any potential non-linear relationships and emphasizing differences between the smaller values in reciprocal transformed data.

3. **Reciprocal reciprocal followed by log**: Combining reciprocal and logarithmic transformations can help in capturing multiplicative relationships while addressing scale differences.

These transformations might help us better capture relationships between features and the target variable, potentially enhancing model performance. However, it's crucial to validate these transformations on the actual dataset and model to ensure they provide a tangible improvement.

1. **f5 log**: Applying logarithm transformation could help in dealing with skewed distributions, making them more symmetric and easier to manage for algorithms sensitive to non-normal distributions.

2. **f7 reciprocal**: Reciprocal transformation can be beneficial for distributing large differences more evenly, especially when values are significantly high.

3. **f10 sqrt**: Square root transformation can soften the effects of very large values, similar to log transformation, providing a gentler approach.

4. **f13 cube**: Cubing can help emphasize larger differences, highlighting tendencies that were not apparent in the base feature.

5. **f8 stand_scaler** and **f14 minmax_scaler**: Standard scaling and min-max scaling are essential transformations for ensuring uniform feature scales, thereby aiding certain model types (such as gradient-based models) to converge better and faster.

Explanation:

1. **Selected Original Features**: Started by including all features for diversity in information.
2. **Cube Transformation**: Applied to selected features based on previous examples, capturing non-linear patterns.
3. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Used for features less likely to be zero to avoid division errors.
4. **Min-Max Scaling**: Helps normalize the range, especially useful for models sensitive to scale.
5. **Cos and Square Transform**: Often useful for cyclical features or when exploring quadratic effects.
6. **Exponential Transformation**: Explores feature interactions potentially useful for capturing exponential effects.
7. **Sqrt and Log**: Combined transformations focus on smoothing variance and capturing multiplicative relationships.
8. **Sigmoid and Tanh**: Non-linear transformations can help when dealing with features that should have bounded outputs like probabilities.
9. **Combined Transformations**: Multiple transformations stack where it makes sense, potentially exposing complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here’s a more complex transformation approach based on the previous examples:

This feature set employs various transformation techniques: 

1. **Square Root and Reciprocal Transformations**: Applied to both base features and reciprocal transformations to manage skewness and nonlinear relationships.
2. **Tanh and Sigmoid**: Used on scaled features to map them into bounded regions, enhancing model resilience against outliers.
3. **Cube and Logarithmic**: Introduces non-linear interactions that can capture complex dependencies.
4. **Scaling Techniques**: Stand-scaler and minmax-scaler improve feature distribution and comparability.
5. **Combined Nested Operations**: Features involving multiple nested transformations (e.g., reciprocal of reciprocal combined with sqrt or cube) to explore deeper complex interactions within the data.

This enhanced approach aims to increase the model's ability to capture subtle patterns that might be predictive of software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:51:46,822 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the previous examples, it is important to maintain complexity that helps capture non-linear relationships while also considering computational efficiency. The examples provided focus on feature scaling, transformation, and complex operations. Here's a new feature set that considers these aspects:

```plaintext

```

This feature set incorporates:

- Various transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `reciprocal` to capture non-linearities.
- Combination operations such as addition (`+`) to model interactions between features.
- Recursive application of transformations to explore deeper and more complex feature interactions.
- Use of operations like `cube` as an alternative to more complex recursive transformations where applicable.

These transformations aim to enhance prediction capability by exploring complex feature interactions and non-linear transformations without overly complicating computation.

2026-01-12 14:51:53,262 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided and the goal of feature engineering for improved predictions in the KC1 Software defect prediction task, we aim to create a feature set that enhances the representation of the data, particularly focusing on transformations that may capture non-linear relationships or scale different aspects of the data effectively. Here is an improved feature set:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 square ,f1 square ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f6 square ,f7 square ,f8 square ,f10 square ,f12 square ,f13 square ,f14 square ,f15 square ,f16 square ,f17 square ,f18 square ,f19 square ,f20 square ,f9 tanh ,f5 sqrt ,f4 log ,f7 reciprocal ,f8 sigmoid ,f10 cube ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f3 cos ,f5 reciprocal ,f6 tanh ,f9 log ,f13 cube]
```

Here's a breakdown of the additions:
- **Transformation Variety**: Adding transformations such as reciprocal and log to features can help capture inverse and logarithmic relationships, which are often useful in identifying non-linear patterns in defect predictions.
- **Feature Interaction**: Including transformations like cube and sigmoid could help in the evaluation of complex interactions between features, potentially uncovering relationships not evident in linearly scaled data.
- **Scaling Techniques**: Ensuring different scaling techniques (min-max and standard scaling) are applied to features that may benefit from normalization, promoting better convergence during model training.
- **Non-linear Transformations**: Non-linear transformations such as tanh and cos are used to introduce non-linearity into the model, which can be beneficial in capturing complex relationships between features and the target variable.

This set attempts to encapsulate a more diverse set of transformations, allowing for improved flexibility and potential capture of meaningful patterns related to the target predictions.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

### Explanation:
- **Cosine Transform on `f9`:** The use of cosine potentially captures cyclical patterns or detects anomalies in Halstead's time estimator, which could reflect in module complexity related to defects. 
- **Square Root and Log Transforms on selected features (`f5`, `f6`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`):** These features are associated with Halstead's measurements like volume, program length, etc. Applying sqrt or log can help in normalization and emphasize lower feature values which may be indicative of simpler logic, possibly divergent from defects. 
- **Tanh Transform on `f9`:** This activation-like function saturates for high and low values helping diminish extreme values' influence, useful for stabilizing time-related measurements.
- **Double Cube Transform:** Applying cube twice to features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`) emphasizes structure complexity, potentially useful for the non-linear space explorations, as complexities often have nonlinear relationships with defects.
- **Standard Scaling on selected features (`f14`, `f19`):** Standardized features commonly enable machine learning models to perform better due to normalized data variance, especially beneficial for features with large variance spread.

This transformation set aims to preserve key information while enhancing distinctions helpful for prediction tasks focused on software quality.

Explanation:

- **New transformations**: I introduced `logarithm`, `sigmoid`, `cos`, and enhanced combinations with `tanh` to explore non-linear relationships.
- **Combining features**: I created new features by combining several existing features, using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and complex transformations like reciprocal, square, cube, and sqrt operations.
- **Scaling and normalizing**: Various scaling methods (`minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`) are applied to re-scale the features, potentially enhancing model performance and convergence.
- **Combining feature transformation**: I juxtaposed transformations (e.g., `minmax_scaler` followed by `tanh`) to explore intricate feature interactions which may hold a hypothesis of linearity or periodicity. 

This set aims to capture various nonlinear and complex relationships between the features which might improve the prediction of software defects.

- **Selected original features (f0, f1, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f10, f12, f13, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20)**: These features are potentially beneficial for predictions with potential complexities mixed.

- **Min-Max Scaled Features**: Scaling features can often improve model performance by normalizing the range between different features. This selection covers various features from both examples.

- **Reciprocal Transformations (f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal)**: Reciprocal transformations can help in cases where the relationship between the feature and the target is inverse.

- **Combined Transformations**: Introducing features as combinations and scaled differences, such as `(f4 f11 -)`, `(f4 f11 - minmax_scaler)`, `(f4 f11 - f9 -)`, `(f4 f11 - f9 - square)`, allows exploring interactions among features, potentially revealing hidden patterns beneficial for prediction.

- **Additional Reciprocal and Ratio Transformations**: Using transformations like `(f6 f9 /)` can reveal proportional relationships that may impact the defect prediction. Also, `(f4 f9 * minmax_scaler)` and `(f7 f20 /)` provide scaled interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 14:52:25,315 - INFO - llm output = To improve feature engineering based on the given examples, we aim to create a comprehensive feature set that not only incorporates potentially useful transformations but also balances complexity and computational efficiency. Both examples make use of basic features, squared features, and transformations such as quantile transformation and tanh activation to capture non-linear relationships. An improved set could emphasize more varied transformations and interactions to potentially capture more complex patterns related to defect prediction.

Here's a better feature set based on the provided examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,

 f9 tanh ,f9 sigmoid ,f8 cos ,f5 sin ,f4 log ,f11 log ,f9 quan_trans ,f9 minmax_scaler ,

 f9 f9 *, f1 f4 * ,f15 f12 /]
```

This feature set includes:

1. **Basic Features**: As the foundation, each original feature is included.

2. **Squared Features**: Common squared transformations capturing more pronounced relationships.

3. **Square Root and Reciprocal Transformations**: To reduce the scale and invert features, these transformations can help manage highly skewed distributions.

4. **Log Transformations**: Applied to help linearize exponential patterns in data features.

5. **Trigonometric Functions**: Capturing cyclic or periodic data patterns and interactions.

6. **Interaction Terms**: Created to capture relationships between pairs of features that could have an impact on the outcome.

This combined approach should improve the model's performance by providing a rich array of features designed to capture linear and non-linear interactions and variations.

```

In this set:
- We maintained a mixture of original features and transformations to maintain feature diversity and breadth.
- Included log transformations to stabilize variance and handle skewness.
- Added tanh and cube operations to further explore non-linear aspects.
- Used `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to possibly normalize the impact of large magnitude features.
- Introduced combinations of transformations that can potentially amplify signal for the defect prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 square ,f1 square ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f6 square ,f7 square ,f8 square ,f10 square ,f12 square ,f13 square ,f14 square ,f15 square ,f16 square ,f17 square ,f18 square ,f19 square ,f20 square ,f9 tanh ,f9 sigmoid ,f9 quan_trans]

2026-01-12 14:52:53,079 - INFO - llm output = Given the provided feature sets and considering the task of software defect prediction using KC1 data, we can aim to create a more effective set by employing various transformations to enhance the predictive capability. When proposing a new feature set, consider enhancing interaction terms and include a variety of non-linear transformations, especially focusing on key features. Here is a proposed feature set inspired by the examples:

1. Start with a selection of key features based on importance and their derived transformations:
   - [f0, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f16, f17, f19]

2. Incorporate key transformations and interactions:
   - [f0 square, f5 square, f6 square, f7 square, f8 square, f10 square, f12 square, f16 square, f17 square, f19 square]
   - [f9 tanh, f9 sigmoid, f9 quan_trans, f9 sin]

3. Add interaction features and more complex transformations:
   - [f9 f10 +, f9 f10 *, f4 f5 +, f5 f6 *]
   - [f9 f9 * square, f0 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f6 reciprocal]

4. Consider deep non-linear transformations:
   - [f0 square square, f1 square square, f3 square square, f4 square square, f4 cos square]
   - [f6 square square, f7 square square, f8 square square]
   - [f9 minmax_scaler, f9 quan_trans square]

5. Overhaul boosted interaction terms and mixed transformations:
   - [f20 reciprocal, f0 reciprocal reciprocal]
   - [f9 minmax_scaler square, f9 sigmoid cos]

Thus, the proposed new feature set is:

[f0 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f12 ,f16 ,f17 ,f19 ,f0 square ,f5 square ,f6 square ,f7 square ,f8 square ,f10 square ,f12 square ,f16 square ,f17 square ,f19 square ,f9 tanh ,f9 sigmoid ,f9 quan_trans ,f9 sin ,f9 f10 + ,f9 f10 * ,f4 f5 + ,f5 f6 * ,f9 f9 * square ,f0 reciprocal ,f5 reciprocal ,f6 reciprocal ,f0 square square ,f1 square square ,f3 square square ,f4 square square ,f4 cos square ,f6 square square ,f7 square square ,f8 square square ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f9 quan_trans square ,f20 reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal ,f9 minmax_scaler square ,f9 sigmoid cos]

This configuration aims to leverage the strengths shown in previous examples by enhancing feature interaction and utilizing non-linear transformations to potentially improve model performance in defect prediction tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 14:53:03,275 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we can focus on enhancing transformations that could capture more meaningful relationships, while avoiding excessive complexity. Here's a new feature set:

```

In this feature set:

1. We keep original features to maintain the existing relationships.
2. We use `cube` transformations on features that have broader numerical ranges to potentially capture nonlinear relationships.
3. We apply `log` transformations to features with skewed distributions, enhancing the interpretability for models sensitive to normality.
4. The `stand_scaler` transformation is maintained on selected features to standardize scaling, aiding models that assume normal distribution.
5. The `cos` transformation for `f9` is kept to capture potential cyclical patterns.

This maintains meaningful complexity while potentially highlighting relationships that could improve defect prediction capabilities.

### Explanation:

1. **Reciprocal Feature Transformations**: Continued use of reciprocal transformations across various features given their prevalence in the examples. Reciprocals can aid linear relationships and stabilize variances.

2. **Square and Reciprocal-Square Transforms**: Applied to enhance non-linear relationships and emphasize variance in magnitude.

3. **Min-Max and Quantile Scaling**: Normalizing specific features using min-max scaling and quantile transformations can reduce the impact of outliers and bring features to a common scale.

4. **Stand Scalings and Combining Features**: Combining min-max scaled features with other transformations like reciprocal and cube on f9 might provide additional insights into the relationships between features.

5. **Combining Operations**: By combining operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication across scaled, transformed, and original features, new insights could be unlocked that are not apparent in the original feature set.

6. **Mix of Other Non-linear Transformations**: Features that utilize sigmoid or tanh offer potential improvements by emphasizing non-linear separability in the dataset.

By combining these strategies, you gain a feature set that utilizes both linear and non-linear transformations to potentially improve predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 14:53:14,821 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets you provided, we can see they focus largely on reciprocal transformations of the features. Let's attempt to create a better feature set using more diverse transformations, taking inspiration from and building upon the existing ones:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal, f4 stand_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 log, f7 square, f8 sqrt, f9 tanh, f10 cube, f11 sigmoid, f12 reciprocal, f13 reciprocal reciprocal, f14 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f15 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f16 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f17 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f18 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f19 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal, f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal]
```

In this enhanced feature set:
- I incorporated various transformations such as `log`, `square`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, `cube`, and `sigmoid` to introduce non-linear effects and to capture different relationships that might be present in the data.
- I kept the reciprocal transformations for some features since they were present in both your sets, which may imply their utility.
- I also added scaling (standard scaler and minmax scaler) for features to normalize them, which can be particularly useful for algorithms sensitive to magnitude differences.

2026-01-12 14:53:23,012 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples you provided, it seems that the transformation of features using functions like reciprocal and scaling has been a focus. The goal is likely to normalize, standardize, or otherwise transform these variables to capture more relevant patterns for defect prediction. Here’s a new feature set that incorporates transformations from both examples but also adds diversity and complexity in the transformation approach:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f4 ,f5 ,f7 ,f8 ,f11 ,f12 ,f17 ,f19 ,f5 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f5 log ,f11 log ,f19 log ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f5 tanh ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal ,f19 reciprocal ,f11 minmax_scaler reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f5 stand_scaler ,f19 stand_scaler ,f5 f19 + ,f0 cube ,f1 cube ,f11 cube ,f19 cube]
```

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Basic Original Features**: Use a selection of original features (loc, cyclomatic complexity, and Halstead metrics) that are important for defect prediction.
   
2. **Reciprocal Transformations**: Continue to use reciprocal transformations as they are known to help handle skewed distributions and magnitudes by compressing range.

3. **Square Root and Logarithm**: Adding square root and logarithmic transformations. They handle non-linear relationships and can tame outliers by reducing the magnitude of large values.

4. **Min-Max and Standard Scaling**: Utilizing both Min-Max scaler and standard scaler can make features more comparable and often improves model stability and convergence during training.

5. **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Transformation**: Helps to squish values within a range, acting as a regularization step.

6. **Cube Transformation**: Adding cube transformation to explore polynomial feature interactions, slightly increasing complexity to capture more nuanced relationships.

7. **Simple Arithmetic Interactions**: Adding combinations such as addition of two relevant features. Capturing interactions could potentially reveal latent relationships. 

This feature set attempts to provide a more balanced and comprehensive transformation that incorporates improvements observed in prior feature sets, while also introducing new methods to capture more complex patterns in the data.

```

**Explanation of Additions:**
1. Interaction terms:
   - `f7 f9 *`, `f8 f9 *`: Multiplication of cyclomatic complexity (f7) or Halstead difficulty (f8) with Halstead effort (f9) could capture complexity-wise effort impacts.
   - `f7 f9 +`, `f8 f9 +`: These additions capture direct effort interactions with complexity moreover.

2. Enhanced transformations:
   - `f9 f10 +`: Combining effort (f9) with time estimator (f10) reflects time scaling with the difficulty of the tasks.
   
3. Logarithmic transformations:
   - `f0 log`, `f5 log`: Applying log function on certain features like loc (f0) and Halstead volume (f5) can reduce skewness and handle features with large ranges effectively. 

These additional features might capture underlying interactions and non-linearity that can improve defect prediction in software modules.

This set uses:
- Cubing and reciprocal transformations on selected original features for non-linear effects.
- Reciprocal transformations, which might help stabilize variance and normalize skewed data.
- Application of scaling and transformation (minmax, standard scaling, tanh, sigmoid) to various features to standardize them and potentially highlight non-linear relationships.
- Repeated operations involving reciprocal, squared, and cubic transformations to capture complex and interaction effects. 

This approach aims to balance complexity and simplicity, leveraging both linear and non-linear transformations which might enhance predictive power given the nature of your task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Below is a refined feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

 f10 cos * f11, f12 sin + f13, 
 f14 cube sqrt, f15 stand_scaler reciprocal, 
 (f16 * f17) reciprocal, (f18 + f19) sqrt]
```

In this new feature set:

1. **Complex Transformations**: I incorporated square, sqrt, and reciprocal operations in combinations with standard scaling and transformations like tanh and sigmoid to allow capturing complex nonlinearities.
   
2. **Combining Features**: Expressions like `(f18 + f19) sqrt` aim to capture interactions between features that could reveal hidden dependencies associated with defect prediction.

3. **Mathematical Functions**: Functions such as `cos`, `sin`, `log`, and `tanh` are applied in different ways to add nonlinear dimensions to the feature set.

4. **Ratio-based Features**: Expressions like `(f16 * f17) reciprocal` aim to explore relationships represented by ratios or proportions, which can be relevant in understanding defect density or complexity effects.

This refined feature set is designed to enhance model flexibility and predictive power by leveraging a variety of transformations and feature interactions.

Key considerations:
- Extended use of reciprocal and scaling transformations across various features to normalize and potentially emphasize variations.
- Introduced `sigmoid` and `log` combined with reciprocal transformations for non-linearity capture.
- Used `cube`, `square`, and `sqrt` in conjunction with other transformations to capture higher-order interactions.
- Focused on `tanh` and `sqrt` for retaining potential non-linear relationships.
- `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` applied to key features for better distribution standardization.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal]

2026-01-12 14:53:52,262 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets provided and aiming to generate a new and improved set, we can incorporate a mixture of scaling, transformation, and interaction features to potentially capture more variance and expressive relationships. Also, since the latter feature set already has a better transformation (min-max scaling and quantile transformation), let's build upon that with additional meaningful interactions and transformations.

Here is the new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f15 minmax_scaler ,f16 minmax_scaler ,f17 minmax_scaler ,f18 minmax_scaler ,f19 minmax_scaler ,f20 minmax_scaler ,f4 f11 - ,f4 f11 - quan_trans ,f4 f11 - minmax_scaler ,f4 f11 - f9 - ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f4 f11 - f9 - square ,f0 f1 * ,f2 f3 * ,f6 f7 * ,f8 f9 * ,f10 f11 * ,f12 f13 * ,f14 f15 * ,f16 f17 * ,f18 f19 * ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f2 log ,f3 log]
```

Changes made:
- Keep mostly similar transformations from the second feature set since it's improved over the first.
- Introduced interaction terms: products of pairs of features which might capture nonlinear relationships.
- Applied logarithmic transformation to some features (appropriate for positive input data) which can help in normalizing skewed distributions.
