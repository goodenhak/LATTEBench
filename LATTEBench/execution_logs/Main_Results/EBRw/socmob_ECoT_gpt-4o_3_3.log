- `f3 sin` adds variability to the sons_occupation predictor.
- `f1 quan_trans sin` provides a solid transformation stack which can handle skewness and emphasize non-linearity.
- `f4 sqrt` and `f3 sin sin` are used to further explore nonlinear interactions.
- `f1 sin sin sin`, `f2 sin sin sin` provide deep non-linear transformations, potentially capturing complex underlying patterns.
- `f4 f1 - tanh sin` combines different transformations to capture potential interactions between features.
- `f4 f1 - tanh` is included to explore how interactions between these two features could affect predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

[f4, f1, f3, f4 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 f1 + sqrt, f4 f3 + sqrt, f1 f3 + sqrt, f4 f1 f3 + + sqrt, f4 tanh]

Explanation:
- I've incorporated square root transformations to potentially normalize data and reduce skewness.

Explanation:

1. **Interactions & Non-linear Transformations**: 
   - Added `f1 f3 * tanh` to capture any non-linear relationships between father's occupation and family structure.
   - Added `f2 f0 * sqrt` to explore interactions between son's and father's occupations.
   - Added `f0 f2 * log` and `f3 f1 * sigmoid` for non-linear transformations that can capture complex patterns.

2. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Retained feature scaling with `stand_scaler` for `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`.

3. **New Transformations**:
   - Added `f4 sqrt` to explore any underlying patterns related to race that might be captured through a square root transformation.
   - Added `f2 f4 * cos` to explore interactions between son's occupation and the race feature, accounting for cyclical patterns.

By incorporating these various transformations, we aim to enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships and improve predictions in the downstream task.

[f2, f3, f4, f2 sin, f3 sin, f1 quan_trans, f1 sin sin, f3 sin sin, f1 sin sin sin, f2 sin sin sin, f3 sin sin sin, f1 quan_trans sin, f4 logsqrt, f2 * f3, f2 / f4, f1 * f1 sin]

Explanation:

- I included existing transformations from the previous examples, such as sine transformations of features and quantile transformation of f1.
- Introduced a combination feature 'f2 * f3' which multiplies two primary features. This interaction might capture dependencies between the two features.
- Used division 'f2 / f4' to build a relationship between f2 and f4, which could be interesting if one feature moderates the influence of another.
- The transformation 'f4 logsqrt' aims to leverage the combination of logarithm and square root to highlight patterns within numerical distributions.
- Introduced 'f1 * f1 sin', exploring interaction within the same feature through multiplication, extending potential insights the sine transformation of f1 might reveal.

This feature design tries to deepen the complexity of transformation, accommodating insights from both mathematical operations and combinations, potentially improving predictive capabilities for classification tasks.

3. **Squared standard scaling** is applied to f2 to capture non-linear relationships.
4. **Cubed** transformation of f0 might capture more complex patterns.
5. **Interactions**:
   - **Scaled interactions** between f1 and f0 to assess joint effects.
   - **Cosine** transformation between f1 and f4 might capture periodic-like interactions.
   - **Hyperbolic tangent** between f2 and f3 helps capture non-linear relationships.
6. **Sigmoid** and **log** transformations between combinations such as f3 and f1, f0 and f3 could help stabilize variance and distributions.
7. **Reciprocal** transformation of f2 helps manage skewness.

2026-01-13 11:32:24,515 - INFO - llm output = To enhance the feature set, we'll try to incorporate transformations that could provide better insights into the relationship between input features and the target variable. Given the transformations from your examples, I'll create a new feature set using a combination of operations and transformations.

Let's focus on using mathematical operations that could introduce non-linearity (to handle possible complex relationships) and scale transformations (to manage different scales and distributions). Additionally, we aim to reduce the dimensionality introduced by complex compositions like repeated applications of `sin`.

Here's a new feature set, aiming to improve interpretability and predictive performance:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 sqrt, f1 log, f2 tanh, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f0 f1 *, f2 f3 /, f0 f4 +]
```

### Explanation:
1. **f0 sqrt**: Square root transformation can help stabilize variance and manage skewness for certain data naturally following a quadratic form.
2. **f1 log**: Logarithmic transformations are particularly useful for data following exponential or power-law distribution, often encountered in real-world data.
3. **f2 tanh**: Tanh can map values between -1 and 1, allowing for gradient-based learning resolutions, enhancing performance for smooth transitions.
4. **f3 minmax_scaler**: Scaling features between 0 and 1 using min-max scaling emphasizes ranges without assuming any distribution.
5. **f4 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling centers data by deducting mean and scaling by variance, necessary for assumptions in models necessitating normality.
6. **f0 f1 ***: Multiplicative interaction between features to capture potential compound effects.
7. **f2 f3 /**: Division interaction, for modeling a ratio relationship—often relevant in socioeconomic indicators.
8. **f0 f4 +**: Addition, modeling a cumulative relationship important in evaluating combination benefits in exploratory features. 

Would you like to fine-tune any more transformations or delve deeper into their rationale?

```

```

### Explanation:
1. **Standard Scaling**: Normalizes each feature to zero mean and unit variance—applied separately to all original features to accommodate them to a similar scale.
   
2. **Feature Interactions and Transformations**:
   - **Sqrt, Tanh, Sin, Cos**: Introduce non-linear relationships between feature interactions.
   - **Log, Reciprocal**: Helps handle skewness and high variability in data.
   - **Combinations of Operations**: Allows capturing complex interactions and potential latent relationships among features.
  
The aim of these transformations is to enhance model performance by capturing more complex, non-linear relationships in the data while maintaining a focus on interactions that might be predictive.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f4 f4 - ,f0 sin ,f1 sin ,f2 sin ,f3 sin ,f4 f4 - sin ,f0 f4 / ,f4 log]
```

Explanation:
1. Keep the existing features: `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f4 f4 -`, as they provide the base information.
2. Use trigonometric functions on `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to capture periodic patterns: `f0 sin`, `f1 sin`, `f2 sin`, `f3 sin`.
3. Use the existing transformed feature `f4 f4 - sin` that applies both subtraction and sine transformations.
4. Introduce interaction between features `f0` and `f4` with division: `f0 f4 /`. This can uncover relative importance or ratio-based insights.
5. Apply the logarithmic transformation on `f4`: `f4 log`. Logarithmic transformation helps in handling skewed data, potentially improving model performance.

1. Begin with the original features: [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4].
2. Apply transformations:

   - Utilize polynomial features from the original feature set to capture interactions and non-linear relationships between features:
     - [f0 f1 *, f0 f2 *, f0 f3 *, f0 f4 *, f1 f2 *, f1 f3 *, f1 f4 *]
   
   - Apply non-linear transformations that can introduce non-linearity and capture complex patterns:
     - [f4 log, f2 f3 tanh, f1 sqrt, f3 sigmoid, f4 sqrt]
     
   - Scale features to improve model performance and reduce the effect of outliers:
     - [f0 stand_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler]
   
   - Add transformed features to the set: 
     - [f1 f2 cube, f2 f3 reciprocal, f2 minmax_scaler]

Keeping the format consistent:

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- `quang_trans` on `f4` can capture quantile-based transformations, potentially uncovering nonlinear relationships.
- Applying `minmax_scaler` followed by `sigmoid` on `f3` creates a non-linear transformation capturing features in a bounded range, which can be particularly useful if the feature has wide value ranges.

Explanation:
1. **Included Original Features**: All original features are included as they provide the base information.
2. **Square Root Transformations**: Applied square root to `f4` double time for potential non-linear normalization benefits. Instead of repeating the transformations from previous examples, I aimed to target a feature that might not have been transformed intensely before. 
3. **Log Transformations**: Applied logarithm on `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to handle any potential skewness and improve feature scaling, particularly for large variation features (note, `log` can be only applied to positive values).
4. **Combination of Features**: The feature `f0 + f3` represents a potential interaction effect between two features that could capture more complex relationships.
   
These transformations aim to capture a broader range of potential relationships and non-linearities, thus enriching the feature space for better model predictions.

1. Focus on using multiple transformations on the same feature to capture non-linear patterns.
2. Incorporate features from both given examples.

- **Sin transformations** on `f0`, `f2`, `f3` attempt to capture cyclical patterns.
- **Quantile transformations** inspired feature `f1 quan_trans` and additional transformations like `sin` and `cube` provide non-linear scaling suitable for potential skewed distributions.
- **Log and reciprocal transformations** on `f4` are to deal with the potential exponential relationships or large value variations.
- **Sinh (hyperbolic sine) transformation**: Derived from basic trigonometric transformation to offer another layer of non-linear relationship via `f0`.

2026-01-13 11:34:10,285 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the examples provided, we will focus on using transformations that can enhance the separability of the target classes by exploiting non-linear relationships and considering transformations that increase the variance explained by individual features. Here's a new feature set that builds upon the latter example:

```plaintext
[f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler,

- We increase the use of non-linear transformations (e.g., `tanh`, `sigmoid`) applied after operations on pairs of features.
- We apply logarithmic transformation and reciprocal operation to further explore the relationships between features and enhance the feature set.
- Incorporation of division and multiplication between features with the added transformations allow capturing complex interactions that might assist in predictions.

These transformations aim to maximize differentiation between the classes ('P' and 'N') based on non-linear relationships that could be predictive.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f1 f2 + ,f1 f3 + ,f2 f0 + ,f2 f1 + ,f2 f2 + ,f2 f3 + ,f3 f2 + ,f3 f3 +]

```

In this feature set:
1. **f2 f4 / stand_scaler**: Introduces a scaled version of the feature ratio, which can help normalize the data across different distributions.
2. **f1 f2 - sinh**: Uses the hyperbolic sine transformation, potentially useful to capture non-linear relationships.

These transformations aim to enhance predictive power while maintaining meaningful interactions and transformations of the input features.

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f0 log, f3 log, f2 f3 *, f4 f1 /, f0 f4 tanh]

Explanation:
- The basic features (f0, f1, f2...) are retained for fundamental data representation.
- Square root transformation can help linearize relationships for features where this might be beneficial.
- Log transformation is useful for handling skewed distributions and for capturing multiplicative relationships.
- Multiplication of f2 and f3 could reveal interaction effects between these features.
- Division like f4 / f1 can potentially highlight relative scales or proportions.
- Applying tanh to f0 f4 combination can capture non-linearity or saturation effects.

The given transformations will introduce new variables capturing different aspects of the original features, aiming to improve predictive modeling by offering these extended representations.

Here's a newly designed feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:
1. **Baseline Features (f2, f3, f4):** Standard numeric features.
   
2. **Trigonometric Features (f2 sin, f3 sin):** As trigonometric transformations can capture cyclic or periodic relationships in data which can be meaningful for certain datasets.

3. **Root Transformation (f2 sqrt):** To smooth out features and dampen the effect of extremely high values, which can skew predictions.

4. **Log Transformation (f4 log)**: Helps in dealing with skewed data and brings down high values.

5. **Nested Trigonometric Transformation (f0 sin sin):** Offer higher complexity and potential to capture multi-tiered relationships.

6. **Quantile Transformer (f1 quan_trans):** Useful for robust scaling and handling outlier-sensitive data.

7. **Double or Triple Sine Transformations (f3 sin sin, f1 sin sin sin):** These deepen the non-linearity captured by the model.

8. **Mixed Transformations (f1 quan_trans sin, f4 log sin):** Help in introducing non-linear characteristics along with stabilized data transformations.

9. **Advanced Non-linear Transformation (f2 sqrt sin):** Combining sqrt and sin to explore higher-order relationships.

10. **Cubing Transformation (f1 quan_trans cube):** Intensify any non-linear relationships present.

This feature set aims to balance diversity and complexity while retaining potentially informative transformations for better capturing underlying patterns in the data.

Here's a breakdown of what the transformations do:

- `f0 stand_scaler`, `f1 stand_scaler`, `f2 stand_scaler`, `f3 stand_scaler`: Standardize these features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can help in normalizing and stabilizing numerical computations.
- `f4 minmax_scaler`: Scale `f4` to be between 0 and 1, which can be beneficial for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling.
- Combine `f0` and `f1` using `+` and then apply `sqrt` to get a feature capturing their non-linear interaction.
- Multiply `f2` and `f3` and apply `tanh` to capture smooth nonlinear transformations.
- Subtract `f3` and `f4` and apply `sin` to capture periodic relationships.
- Multiply `f1` and `f0` and apply `reciprocal` to capture inverse relationships.
- Divide `f4` and `f2` and apply `log` to generate a feature involving rate of change dynamics.
- Multiply `f1`, `f3`, and `f2` and apply `cube` to capture nonlinear interactions at multiple features.
- Divide `f3` and `f0` and apply `cos` to model any periodicity.
- Subtract `f2` and `f1` and apply `sigmoid` to squeeze values between 0 and 1, potentially interpreting it like probabilities. 

These transformations are designed to extract more nuanced patterns in the data that can be leveraged for better predictive performance on the downstream classification task.
