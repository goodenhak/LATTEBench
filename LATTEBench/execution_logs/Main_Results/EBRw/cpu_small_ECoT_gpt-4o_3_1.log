you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 19:43:18,956 - INFO - llm output = Sure, let's create a better feature set based on the examples provided. The idea is to create features that could better capture the potential nonlinear interactions and transformations present in the data. For example, combining log transformations with other operations can help handle skewed distributions effectively, while square root and standard scaling may help normalize the data.

Here is a new feature set that builds on the examples provided:

```
[f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f10, f11, f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f5 log, f6 log, f10 log, f11 log, f2 f11 /, f3 f11 /, f4 f11 /, f5 f11 /, f6 f11 /, f7 log f11 /, f8 log f11 /, f9 log f11 /, f7 stand_scaler f11 /, f8 stand_scaler f11 /, f9 stand_scaler f11 /, f11 stand_scaler, f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f2 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f2 sqrt log, f3 sqrt log, f4 sqrt log, f5 sqrt log, f6 sqrt log, f10 sqrt log, f2 sqrt sigmoid, f3 sqrt sigmoid, f4 sqrt sigmoid, f5 sqrt sigmoid, f6 sqrt sigmoid, f10 sqrt sigmoid, f2 sqrt tanh, f3 sqrt tanh, f4 sqrt tanh, f5 sqrt tanh, f6 sqrt tanh, f10 sqrt tanh]
```

This set incorporates various transformations including log, square root, sigmoid, and tanh, applied selectively on a range of original features. Additionally, the use of standard scaling and quantile transformation enhances the stabilization of variance and normalization of features, potentially aiding model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 19:44:32,643 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by combining insights from the given examples, we’ll aim to retain the most useful transformations while introducing additional meaningful transformations that could still capture more nuanced relationships. The given examples have already included some sophisticated transformations such as minmax_scaler, sigmoid, and differences (using subtraction with `f2`), which can be quite valuable for capturing non-linear relationships.

Here's a new feature set, building on the provided examples:

```
[f3, f3 minmax_scaler, f2 quan_trans, f3 square, f4 cube, f2 stand_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler tanh, f2 f5 /, f2 cube f5 reciprocal, f3 minmax_scaler f5 reciprocal, f4 cube f5 reciprocal, f5 sqrt sigmoid, f5 cube minmax_scaler tanh, f3 sine f2 sqrt, f4 cos f5 cube, f5 tanh f2 minmax_scaler, f2 tanh f5 minmax_scaler, f2 sqrt f3 stand_scaler, f4 square f5 minmax_scaler, f4 sqrt f5 cube f3 /, f5 sqrt f2 tanh /, f3 minmax_scaler f2 reciprocal /, f4 log f5 cube /, f5 cube f2 quan_trans /]
```

Explanation:
1. We expand and combine transformations using operations akin to the original examples.
2. Introduce reciprocal, cube, and trigonometric transformations to capture more complexities.
3. Use interactions between `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, and `f5` to increase inter-feature relationships.
4. Minmax_scaler and sigmoid or tanh help in achieving normalization but capturing non-linearity.
5. The postfix notation sequence still emphasizes operations-based relationships including scaling differences, and operations like cube and sqrt to capture potential interactions not plain in original features.

This enhanced feature set is designed to provide different perspectives and scales of interaction between the base features to aid the downstream prediction task of ‘portion of time that CPUs run in user mode’.

Here is an improved feature set inspired by both examples:

- Start with the basic features: [f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f10, f11]
- Apply square root transformations, which can be useful for normalizing skewed data: [f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f10 sqrt]
- Use logarithmic transformations to address skewness and compress large ranges: [f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f8 log]
- Apply reciprocal transformations to emphasize the impact of small values: [f0 f11 /, f2 f11 /, f3 f11 /, f4 f11 /, f5 f11 /, f6 f11 /, f9 f11 /]
- Scale features to have zero mean and unit variance, helpful for models that are sensitive to feature scaling: [f7 stand_scaler]
- Apply square transformations to amplify the importance of features: [f11 square]
- Use sigmoid transformations to normalize features to a (0, 1) range: [f5 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f5 sqrt sigmoid, f6 sqrt sigmoid]
- Include quantile transformation to make the feature distribution more Gaussian-like: [f2 quan_trans]
- Introduce min-max scaling to rescale features within a fixed range: [f10 minmax_scaler]

This set of features incorporates a broad array of transformations, useful for capturing different aspects of the data distribution, scaling, and potential non-linear relationships that can be beneficial for prediction tasks.

2026-01-13 19:45:55,737 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and operations, we aim to generate a new feature set with more informative transformations. Our goal is to incorporate a mix of effective scaling, transformations, and combinations that might help improve model predictions for the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode. 

Here's a new and improved feature set considering both examples:

```

```

This set includes a diverse array of transformations:

1. **Scaling Operations:** Both Min-Max Scaling and Standard Scaling are applied to multiple features to ensure they are on comparable scales.

2. **Non-linear Transformations:** Use of cube and tanh transformations to capture potential non-linear relationships.

3. **Basic Mathematical Operations:** Inclusion of combinations like `f1 f5 * minmax_scaler` and `f11 f9 + log` to encapsulate interactions and complex dependencies between features.

4. **Various Mathematical Functions:** Incorporating sqrt and reciprocal functions to further explore data distribution.

By using these operations, we aim to create features that may uncover hidden patterns or relationships useful for the prediction task.

2026-01-13 19:46:35,283 - INFO - llm output = To provide a better feature set, we will aim to combine the strengths of both examples you've provided, while optimizing with potentially more insightful transformations. The first set focuses heavily on min-max scaling and iterative scaling, while the second set includes log transformations across several original features and also utilizes sigmoid, which can be useful for normalization in a bounded scale. 

Here is a refined feature set based on the above examples:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f11 sqrt, f11 log, f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f7 sigmoid, f2 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f2 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f3 log minmax_scaler, f8 log minmax_scaler, f6 tanh, f9 cube, f10 reciprocal]

**Explanation:**

1. **Core Original Features (f0, f1, ..., f11)**: Retain all original features as they might have inherent predictive power.

2. **Standard Scaler (f2 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler)**: Using standard scaling to convert the data to a standard normal distribution, which can help algorithms that rely on Euclidean distance.

3. **Square Root (f11 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f5 sqrt)**: Square root transformations are effective for stabilizing variance in asymmetric distributions.

4. **Logarithm (f11 log, f2 log, f3 log, f4 log)**: Log transformations are useful for normalizing right-skewed data.

5. **Min-Max Scaler (f3 log minmax_scaler, f8 log minmax_scaler)**: Combining log transformation with min-max scaling can help further scale transformed features to a manageable range.

6. **Sigmoid (f7 sigmoid)**: Retain sigmoid transformation as it effectively squashes values between 0 and 1, which is useful for inherently bounded interpretations.

7. **Tanh (f6 tanh)**: Tanh scales values between -1 and 1, making it suitable for symmetric distributions.

8. **Cube and Reciprocal (f9 cube, f10 reciprocal)**: Using cube transformation for emphasizing differences in skew and reciprocal transformation to handle features where the transformation could be useful for spreading out values on smaller scales.

This ensures a balance between effectively scaled features, while taking advantage of non-linear transformations that may capture the variability and interactions in the data.

Explanation:
- Original Features (`f0`, `f1`, ..., `f11`) are included to maintain the full information spectrum.
- `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` are applied to all basic features for normalization and standardization, providing a consistent range and centered values.
- `square`, `sqrt`, and `reciprocal` are applied to select features to highlight non-linear relationships within the data.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

In this set, I've added reciprocal divisions of new features f7, f8, and f9 with features f4, f5, and f6, respectively, assuming hypothetical new features for enhanced combinations with existing features. Additionally, these new features are scaled using minmax_scaler to provide normalized values. These transformations and combinations should create a richer feature set, potentially capturing complex interdependencies within the data.

Let's harness log transformations, scaled features, and interactions with respect to the 11th feature (f11) for potentially improved predictive power. Here's an improved feature set:

```

Here's a breakdown of the additions and modifications:
- Included `f8 log` and `f9 log` to explore logs of interfaces potentially capturing interaction characteristics.
- Added an interaction term `f0 f1 * f11 /` that combines memory reads and writes normalized by `f11`, potentially capturing a nuanced, complex pattern in the data regarding resource usage.
- Retained the standard scaling and logarithmic divisions by `f11` to maintain normalized variance.

These transformations might enhance the model's ability to uncover intricate patterns and predictive signals.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation of Transformations:
- We've retained some standard scaling, logarithmic and division transformations for normalization and to handle variations in scale.
- New interactions, such as multiplication and division among features, are added to explore potential non-linear relationships.
- Non-linear transformations like sqrt, tanh, and minmax_scaler are introduced to capture possible exponential or saturating behavior.
- Combinations of interactions and transformations can encode complex relationships that may better capture the underlying structure of the data for predicting the target variable.

### Explanation:
1. **Standard and Composite Features**: Begin with basic and scaled features to provide a foundational representation.
  
2. **Pairwise Interactions**: Using products of original features and transformed features (e.g., `f0 f7 *`) helps to capture interactions between different metrics.

3. **Log Transformations**: Applying log where applicable to stabilize variance and make certain feature distributions more Gaussian, potentially benefiting linear models.

4. **Reciprocal Transformations**: Including reciprocal transformations can help in handling skewness and capturing inverse relationships.

5. **Combinations of Transformed Features**: Create composite features by combining scaled features with transformed ones via addition and multiplication for greater expressiveness.

6. **Advanced Mathematical Operations**: The square root and cube operations can help capture non-linear relationships in the data that might be influencing the outputs in user mode.

This set of features should offer a more comprehensive representation compared to the previous examples, potentially enhancing model performance through improved capturing of intricate patterns in the data.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Interactions:** Additional interactions such as `f2 f6 *` and `f4 f10 *` could capture the combined effects of input/output transfers between read/write calls and system memory, which might correlate with CPU usage in user mode.

2. **Non-linear transformations:** Applying transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `log` on specific features helps in addressing non-linearity in data. For instance, using `log` on `f11` (freemem) and `f0 f7 *` to stabilize variance.

3. **Combining transformations:** Example features like `f0 f8 * minmax_scaler` apply minmax scaling after interaction which could help normalize these new synthesized features.

4. **Additional interactions:** New interactions such as `(f0 f8 *) minmax_scaler` and `(f1 f9 *) minmax_scaler` can capture and scale combinations not present before, possibly capturing important relationships between reads/writes operations.

This blend aims to enhance predictive power by introducing interactions, scaling, and non-linear transformations into the feature engineering process, enabling better modeling of complex, multi-dimensional relationships inherent in the dataset.

Explanation:
- The previous examples used the `minmax_scaler` on `f7` and `f11` independently, suggesting these features might hold valuable information for predicting the target variable. 
- Combining `f7` and `f11` through addition before applying `minmax_scaler` captures aggregated influence, potentially bringing more insight into their relationship and improving the model's performance in capturing patterns relevant to CPU usage prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

### Explanation:
- **MinMax Scaler and Standard Scaler**: Continue to use these scalers as they help to normalize the feature set and might expose patterns more clearly. 
- **Logarithmic Transformation**: Log transformation for certain features (like fork, exec, and rchar) can help reduce skewness and handle a wide range of values, especially for features that have a high range/variety.
- **Square Root Transformation**: Applied to features like rchar and wchar to reduce skewness and stabilize variance.
- **New Features through Arithmetic Operations**: Introducing operations like division and multiplication between certain features can help to identify interaction effects that may be significant for CPU usage prediction:
  - `f0/f1`: Understands the read-to-write ratio between memory systems.
  - `f2/f3`: Captures a ratio of calls related to reading, which might significantly impact CPU usage in user mode.
  - `f4*f7`: Incorporates interaction between two processes to find compounded effects.

Adding these transformations should bring deeper insights into the data and thus potentially improve predictive performance. That said, these transformations should follow exploratory data analysis to avoid impractical conclusions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, we apply a variety of transformations including standard scaling, min-max scaling, logarithmic transformation, square root, cube, reciprocal, hyperbolic tangent, sine, and cosine operations. These transformations can help normalize the distribution, reduce dimensionality by highlighting non-linear relationships, and mitigate skewness in certain features, thus possibly improving the downstream prediction model's performance.

2026-01-13 19:51:06,024 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets provided, let's evaluate them based on the operations used and try to propose a better feature set for the prediction task at hand.

1. The first feature set includes logarithmic transformations, standard scaling, and ratio transformations with `f11`. These transformations can be useful for normalization and highlighting relationships. However, it heavily depends on the division operation with `f11`. It also includes the standard scaling, which might help in removing bias.

2. The second feature set focuses on basic features and logarithmic transformations. It keeps all the original features intact and enhances them with logarithmic transformations to reduce skewness and improve feature representation.

A productive approach would be to combine both feature transformation methods, utilize the rich operations introduced in the first method, and incorporate extensive normalizations with caution on division transformations to avoid division by zero or similar pitfalls. Here’s a proposed improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, 
 f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f8 log, f9 log, f10 log, f11 log, 
 f0 f11 /, f2 f11 /, f3 f11 /, f4 f11 /, 
 f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, 
 f2 cube, f3 cube, f3 tanh, f7 tanh,
 f2 log f11 /, f4 log f11 /, f8 log f11 /]
```

**Explanation:**

- Retained the original features to maintain interpretability.
- Incorporated logarithmic transformations to better handle skewed data and improve linearity.
- Included division with `f11` for pertinent features to capture relationships while carefully applying it.
- Applied min-max scaling to a subset of features, allowing for comparisons across features on different scales.
- Used cube transformations to capture nonlinear patterns, as well as hyperbolic tangent transformations for their differentiable smoothing effects, which might capture complex relationships not easily modeled by linear methods.
- Added logarithmic transformed features divided by `f11` to find unique feature interactions under different scales.

This feature set attempts to balance between enhancing interpretability and introducing complex interactions and normalizations that might reveal deeper insights into the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

These operations can help account for relationships between freeswap and other features and reduce the influence of scale differences. Building on these examples, a better feature set could further explore interactions and transformations capturing non-linear relationships and intrinsic scaling:

```

**Explanation:**
- **Square Root Transformations (`sqrt`)**: Applying square root to features like `f0`, `f1`, `f6`, and `f11` can help handle skewness and variances, particularly for features with large ranges or deviations.
- **Feature Interactions (`*, /`)**: Cross-multiplying or dividing features (e.g., `f2 f3 *`, `f5 f6 *`, `f2 f10 /`) can capture relevant combined effects and nonlinearities between them, providing richer insights into complex relationships.
- **Sine and Cosine Transformations (`sin`, `cos`)**: Applying periodic transformations like sine on `f11` and cosine on `f9` can capture inherent periodic behavior that might be indicative of fluctuating resource availability or process demands.
- **Min-Max Scaling and Tanh Transformations (`minmax_scaler`, `tanh`)**: These transformations on `f11` and `f8` can effectively scale the features or transform them into smooth curves, capturing saturation or threshold-dependent behavior, which can be prevalent in memory or system processes.

These transformations aim to robustly model complex interactions, potential periodicities, and scale discrepancies in the features, thus supporting improved prediction outcomes for CPU user mode running times.

2026-01-13 19:52:13,604 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and transformations, the goal is to generate new features that could potentially improve model predictions. When combining operations and feature transformations, it's valuable to include various interactions, scalings, and nonlinear transformations that may capture underlying patterns relevant to predicting user mode CPU time. The second set has interesting transformations like standard scaling and feature interactions, which can help in capturing relationships better.

Here's a new potential suggested feature set that combines some of the strengths from both given examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f5 sqrt,  f10 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f5 log, f9 log, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f0 f7 *, f1 f7 *, f7 f8 *, f1 f9 +, f2 f3 f4 *, f2 f3 + f4 log *, f5 f9 minmax_scaler f6 sqrt *, f0 log f1 minmax_scaler + sin, f8 f9 reciprocal tanh *]
```

### Explanation:
- **Scaling**: Use a mix of min-max scaling and standard scaling to normalize features, catering to different types of data distributions.
- **Non-linear transformations**: Included reciprocal, square root, and log transformations to handle non-linearity and skewness.
- **Feature Interactions**: Added interactions that multiply or add features, considering their combined influence.
- **Complex transformations**: Added trigonomic functions like `sin` and `tanh` on important combinations, which may help in capturing complex patterns in the data.

This should give a well-rounded enhancement to the feature space.

Explanation of enhancements:

1. **Root and Log Transformations**: Applying `sqrt` and `log` can help to manage skewed distributions, often stabilizing variance and making patterns more linear.

2. **Cube and Square Transformations**: `cube` and `square` amplify the relationships in features, potentially capturing non-linear interactions, especially in cases where higher values indicate substantial changes in system behavior.

3. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Useful to manage features that might have very high values by inversing them, providing a different perspective.

4. **Hyperbolic and Trigonometric Functions**: `tanh` adaptation might help in saturating values and capturing subtle patterns; this can be beneficial in neural contexts or where balance-centered transformations are useful.

5. **Interactions and Combinations**: Multiplying (`*`), dividing (`/`), adding (`+`), and subtracting (`-`) features can highlight interactions between system calls and memory attributes, emphasizing underlying connections related to CPU usage time in user mode.

These refined transformations exploit statistical techniques and mathematical functions to unveil complex relationships and facilitate better predictive modeling.

Given the progression from the first to the second set of examples, a logical next step would include transformations that further refine the data distributions or relationships.

Let's extend the feature set as follows:

Explanation:
1. **f5 minmax_scaler:** Scaling f5 using Min-Max scaling to ensure its variance is adjusted, bringing it to a range between 0 and 1.
2. **f6 sqrt:** Taking the square root of f6 helps manage large range discrepancies, emphasizing smaller values in a dataset that might be skewed.
3. **f11 reciprocal:** Applying a reciprocal transformation to f11 can be useful in datasets where extreme values have significant predictive power, transforming them to reduce their impact and improve relationships. 

These transformations help to normalize the data further, capture non-linear relationships, and potentially reveal more insights for the downstream prediction tasks.

Considering the features and transformations from the examples you provided, here’s a refined feature set:

```

### Explanation:

1. **Include Original and Logarithmic Features:**
   - Include the original features and their logarithmic transformations where appropriate, as these may help in dealing with skewed distributions and scale differences.

2. **Include Standard Scaler Features:**
   - Standard scaling helps normalize the data distribution, especially useful for features like `freemem`, `rchar`, and `wchar` which may have a broad range of values.

3. **Feature Interaction Using Division:**
   - Feature interactions such as division by `f11` (freeswap) are retained because they can help understand the feature's contribution relative to available resources (e.g., memory available).

4. **Stand-Alone Scale of Key Features:**
   - Directly replicate the use of stand-alone scales (e.g., `f11 stand_scaler`) for potentially better capturing variance and scaling effects intrinsic to the data.

This feature set reflects more balanced distribution considerations and feature interactions while maintaining a concise and computationally feasible approach.

We'll leverage combination operations, scaling, and non-linear transformations to capture more complex relationships among features. Here is a proposed improved feature set:

```

In this new feature set, the following strategies were used:

1. **MinMax Scaling**: Applied to various features to bring all values within a similar range, improving model sensitivity to variations.
   
2. **Feature Combinations**: Multiple combinations of features multiplied together to capture interactions between them that can influence 'user mode' prediction positively.

3. **Nested Scaling**: Double scaling (scaled then scaled again) for features to further normalize their impact.

4. **Increased focus on `f7`**: Given its role in the initial examples, encouraging feature combinations with `f7` and using scaling methods often linked with it.

By increasing the diversity and complexity of the features, the goal is to improve the model's ability to generalize and predict more accurately.

```

**Explanation:**

- **Logging transformations on `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, and `f10`:** Using log transformations on features that typically exhibit skewness can make them more normally distributed, which can be helpful for models that assume normality, such as linear regression.

- **Square Root Transform on `f7` and `f8`:** Applying square root transformation can help stabilize variance and make the data more normal distribution-like, especially if the original distribution is positively skewed.

- **`minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler`:** Retained from the examples to ensure features are scaled appropriately for model input. Using both scalers can enhance feature normalization and comparison across different value ranges.

Overall, these transformations should help in extracting more nuanced information from the data and improve model predictions.

Based on the examples provided and aiming to create a better feature set for the prediction task, we can enhance the existing feature sets by incorporating additional transformations and interactions that could reveal more insights into the data:

Here is the improved feature set:

Adjustments:
1. **Logarithmic Transformation**: Included `f5 log`, `f11 log` for more features which might help in capturing non-linear relationships.
2. **Standardization**: Added standard scaling for `f8` to have consistent scaling and centralization for potentially crucial features.
3. **Trigonometric Functions**: Incorporated `f9 sin` and `f9 cos` which can capture cyclical variations if they exist.
4. **Feature Interaction**: Added `f2 f3 *` to capture interactions between related features and `f6 f7 +` as a potential additive effect.

2026-01-13 19:55:47,377 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions, it's useful to create features that capture various interactions and transformations of the original attributes. The latter example uses more min-max scaling, which is a positive step toward normalizing data for more effective modeling. However, further improvements can be made by incorporating additional transformations that might capture non-linear relationships, smooth variations, and scale different attributes.

Here's the refined feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f0 square ,f6 log ,f5 sqrt ,f1 reciprocal ,f3 tanh ,f8 stand_scaler]
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Min-Max Scaling across all features**: Ensures that each feature scales between 0 and 1, enhancing the model's ability to handle variations equitably.
   
2. **Additional Transformations**:
   - `f0 square`: Captures quadratic relationships which might be indicative in certain situations, especially if a non-linear relationship exists between the reads and the response.
   - `f6 log`: Useful for capturing relationships that are exponential in nature or highly skewed distributions (such as execution calls).
   - `f5 sqrt`: Smooths variations in fork calls, capturing less dramatic changes in small values.
   - `f1 reciprocal`: Useful for stabilizing variance in the data.
   - `f3 tanh`: Compresses large variability and is useful for handling divergent data without extreme scaling.
   - `f8 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling brings features to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can be helpful in models sensitive to distribution shifts such as SVMs.

These transformations not only normalize but also enrich the feature set by exploring potential interactions and non-linear dynamics in the underlying data that could enhance the predictive power of the model.

2026-01-13 19:56:10,108 - INFO - llm output = Based on the previous feature sets provided and aiming to generate an even better feature set, let's apply operations to enhance feature representation. We'll incorporate transformations that may capture complex relationships in the data, optimizing predictive performance:

```plaintext
[f0 square, f1 sqrt, f2 stand_scaler, f3 reciprocal, f4 log, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 cube, f7 sigmoid, f8 tanh, f9 / f10, f11 quan_trans, f7 minmax_scaler]
```

**Explanation for the selected transformations:**

1. **Square & Cube:** Higher-degree polynomial features can capture non-linear relationships when combined with other features.
2. **Sqrt:** This transformation can help manage scales with high variance and smooth out relationships.
3. **Stand_scaler & Minmax_scaler:** Both scalers normalize features, the first in terms of standard deviation and the mean, and the latter to a 0-1 range. This can help algorithms converge more quickly and perform better.
4. **Reciprocal & Log:** These can stabilize variance and turn multiplicative relationships into additive ones.
5. **Sigmoid & Tanh:** These nonlinearities can help introduce saturation effects, capturing complex interactions.
6. **Division:** A feature interaction, dividing `f9` by `f10` might create a useful ratio.
7. **Quantile transformation:** Transforms features to follow a uniform or normal distribution, which may enhance model robustness.

The transformed features should now offer more depth and interaction potential for modeling, ideally enhancing prediction accuracy on the given task.

Answer: 93.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 19:56:24,260 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using the techniques of feature engineering, we can leverage some transformations and scaling methods that are likely to highlight useful patterns and relationships between features and the target variable. Building upon the examples provided, here's a new feature set:

```

```

Explanation:
1. **Log and Sqrt**: Applying logarithmic and square root transformations to `f7` and `f8` (which involve potentially large numbers of characters transferred per second) can reduce skewness in these feature distributions and make the model more robust to scale differences.

2. **Min-Max Scaling**: Scaling `f7` and `f8` to the range [0, 1] may help the model handle different magnitudes better, especially if `f7` and `f8` are significant contributors to the target variable's variance.

3. **Tanh Transformation**: Applying a tanh transformation to the features `f6` and `f5`, which deal with fork and exec calls, may help highlight relationships related to high variations in these system calls.

4. **Reciprocal Transformation**: `f10` and `f11` could benefit from reciprocal transformations to assist the model in uncovering multiplicative relationships.

5. **Standard Scaling**: Features `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and the log-transformed version of `f9` are standard-scaled to ensure they follow a standard normal distribution, which could help in models that are sensitive to feature scales.

This set leverages multiple transformation techniques to extract and highlight relevant patterns likely aiding in prediction of the portion of time CPUs run in user mode.

- Subtraction interactions with `f11` are tested (e.g., `f3 f11 -`, `f4 f11 -`) to explore differential relationships with `f11`.
- Non-linear transformations such as `tanh` and `sqrt` for selected features which might help capture non-linear patterns.

Answer: 93.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 19:57:29,520 - INFO - llm output = To improve the predictions using feature engineering, we should aim to capture meaningful interactions and transformations of the original features that can enhance the performance of the model. Let's derive a new set of features based on the given examples, considering the statistical properties of the data.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

1. **Basic Features:** Directly include all original features as part of the new feature set.
   - [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11]

2. **Logarithm Transformation:** Log transformations can help stabilize variance and can be useful when dealing with exponential data.
   - [f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f7 log, f8 log, f9 log]

3. **Normalization and Standardization:** Use standard scaling and min-max scaling on features that have high variance or range to improve model convergence.
   - [f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler]

4. **Reciprocal Transformation:** Useful for highly skewed distributions where the variable has values significantly greater than 1.
   - [f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal]

5. **Interaction Features:** Create interaction features by considering meaningful divisions which might reveal potential relationships in the data.
   - [f2 f11 /, f3 f11 /, f4 f11 /, f6 f11 /]

6. **Complex Transformations:** Experiment with more complex transformations like square, cube, or sigmoid for capturing non-linear relationships.
   - [f7 square, f9 cube, f11 sigmoid]

7. **Aggregated Feature Transformations:** Aggregate transformations can help in summarizing data distributions and relationships.
   - [(f0 + f1 + f2 + f3 + f4 + f5 + f6 + f7 + f8 + f9 + f10 + f11) / 12]  # Average of all features

The proposed feature set is:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f2 log, f3 log, f4 log, f7 log, f8 log, f9 log, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f2 f11 /, f3 f11 /, f4 f11 /, f6 f11 /, f7 square, f9 cube, f11 sigmoid, (f0 + f1 + f2 + f3 + f4 + f5 + f6 + f7 + f8 + f9 + f10 + f11) / 12]

Feel free to adjust this set further based on additional insights or constraints that might be present in your specific use case.

2026-01-13 19:58:56,340 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using the previous examples, we aim to include interactions and transformations that capture more complex relationships among the features. Here’s a new feature set that builds upon the examples given:

```

Here's the rationale for the new feature set:

1. **Basic transformations and scalings:** Applying min-max scaling, logarithmic transformations, and simple trigonometric functions (like tanh and sin) to individual features helps in normalizing their distributions and uncovering potential nonlinear relationships.

2. **Feature interactions:** Combining pairs of original features through addition, multiplication, and more complex operations helps to model interactions between features, which can be crucial for improving prediction accuracy.

3. **Complex composed features:** Creating transformations that involve multiple steps and interactions considers the possibility of higher-order relationships and dependencies, which are often present in complex systems. By chaining operations such as scaling, reciprocal, tanh, and cube, we aim to capture a more nuanced dependency structure.

This new feature set introduces a variety of transformations and combinations to enrich the information accessible to predictive models.

- We apply both min-max scaling and standard scaling to a subset of features to account for different scaling effects.
- We use square, cube, sqrt, log, reciprocal, tanh, and sigmoid transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- We introduce interactions and additional feature combinations, such as `f8+f9+f10+f11`, and ratios such as `f4/f6` to leverage relationships between different attributes.
- Quantile transformation and sigmoid are applied to selected features to handle distributions that might be skewed or bounded.

2026-01-13 19:59:40,689 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, let's consider additional transformations that could improve the predictive power by capturing more complex relationships within the data.

Given the previous feature sets, we can incorporate interactions between features and nonlinear transformations. Since the latter feature set includes `stand_scaler` transformations, it's useful—but we can try more complex interactions and wider transformations.

Here's a potentially better feature set:

```
[f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 stand_scaler ,f10 log ,f11 log ,f2 log ,f3 log ,f4 log ,f10 log ,f2 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f2 log f11 / ,f3 log f11 / ,f4 log f11 / ,f8 log f11 / ,f0 f11 cube / ,f11 square ,f10 square ,f3 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f7 stand_scaler f11 sin / ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler]
```

Explanation:
- We retained a focus on `log` transformations for features related to calls and transfers since logs are useful for handling skewed distributions.
- Added `sqrt` to soften the effect of larger values without completely flattening them.
- Introduced `square` transformations to allow for quadratic relationships to be captured.
- Applied `cube` transformation with a conditional division to interact deeply with the response variable.
- Incorporated `tanh` and `sin` for non-linear interactions that might capture complex patterns.
- Continued utilizing scaling transformations (`stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`) which help in normalization, allowing algorithms to work more efficiently.

This new feature set continues to leverage scaling and log transformations heavily but adds explorations into tanh, cube, and more complex combinations of features to potentially encode non-linear interactions among them better. By integrating both original features and various transformations as part of combinations, the goal is to improve predictive capabilities on portions of CPU user mode time.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

```

Here's the reasoning for the newly added features:
1. **Scalers**: Including `minmax_scaler` for additional features (`f7`) to capture normalized distributions, enhancing the model's sensitivity.
2. **Statistical Normalization**: Adding `stand_scaler` for features (`f10`, `f11`) helps reducing potential skewness.
3. **Advanced Transformations**: More complex transformations like `sqrt` on scaled features introduce non-linearity which may capture hidden interaction effects.
4. **Interactions**: Combining multiple pairs (`f7`, `f11`) and triples (`f2 f3 * f11`) to explore complex statistical dependencies.
5. **Enhanced Operations**: Adding operations with scaled transformations and other arithmetic operations to ensure capturing additional interactions and dependencies.

This new feature set combines basic and more sophisticated transformations along with leveraging possible interactions, aiming to capture latent relationships for better predictive performance.

Additionally, both sets include some feature interactions and nonlinear transformations using operations such as multiplication, addition, and subtraction. 

To improve predictions, we can combine useful transformations from the two examples and add new ones that might capture additional data variance or interactions.

Here’s a transformed feature set that integrates and extends useful transformations from both examples while including new ones for potentially better performance:

```

```

**Explanation for Additional Transformations:**

1. **New Mathematical Interactions:**
   - `(f0 f1 +) sqrt`: Captures the additive interaction of features `f0` and `f1` with a nonlinear square root transformation.
   - `(f2 f3 -) log`: Subtractive interaction of features `f2` and `f3` followed by a log transformation, potentially capturing multiplicative effects.
   - `(f4 f5 *) sqrt`: Multiplicative interaction of `f4` and `f5` with square root transformation, useful for capturing nonlinear effects.

2. **Use of Trigonometric Functions:**
   - `f10 sin` and `f11 cos`: Introduced to capture periodicity or cyclical patterns if applicable.

3. **Feature Products:**
   - `f7 f0 +` and `f4 f2 *`: Simple feature combinations to allow models to explore potential synergistic effects between different input features. 

4. **Feature Standardization and Normalization:**
   - Consistently applied across various features to ensure scale consistency and improve convergence and model stability.

Answer: 93.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f2 log ,f3 log ,f4 log ,f8 log ,f9 log ,f10 log ,f7 stand_scaler]

2026-01-13 20:01:32,688 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, here's a new feature set considering potential transformations and interactions that may provide better predictive power:

```

This feature set builds on transformations and interactions:

1. **Logarithmic Transformation**: `f2 log` is kept from the first feature set example as logarithmic transformation can handle skewness in the data.

2. **Multiplicative Interaction**: `f3 f7 *` introduces a multiplicative interaction between `f3` and `f7`, potentially capturing interaction effects between these two features.

3. **Division Interaction**: `f4 f8 /` introduces a division-based interaction that might capture the relative impact or ratio between these features.

4. **Square Root Transformation**: `f9 sqrt` applies a square root transformation to dampen the impact of large values and help normalize skewed distributions.

5. **Hyperbolic Tangent Transformation**: `f10 tanh` applies a hyperbolic tangent transformation to constrain feature values between -1 and 1, potentially tackling outliers and extreme values.

6. **Standard and Min-Max Scaling**: Both `f8 stand_scaler` and `f7 minmax_scaler` involve feature scaling to ensure comparability and normalization of feature ranges.

These transformations add layers of interpretability and potential predictive power while building on the examples you provided.

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Log Transformations**: Applying log transformations to original features can help manage skewed distributions and reduce the impact of outliers.

2. **MinMax Scaling**: Scaling features to a bounded range [0, 1] helps in learning to focus on relative differences, which can often be more important than absolute values.

3. **Square Root Transformation**: Useful for compressing large ranges and stabilizing variance.

4. **Basic Operations (Addition, Multiplication, Division)**: Applying these to feature pairs can expose underlying relationships and interactions between features that reflect compound effects within the system.

5. **Reciprocal Transformation**: This can address large values in features by converting them into smaller, more manageable representations.

By enhancing interaction terms and applying various transformations, this feature set is designed to yield more informative and differentiated features for the prediction task at hand.

2026-01-13 20:03:25,417 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, let's work on creating a better feature set using the techniques and transformations suggested. We aim to enhance the predictive capacity by combining previous transformations and introducing new ones.

Here is the improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f7 log, f0 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f4 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f6 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f11 reciprocal, f2 f3 *, f4 f5 *, f6 f10 *, f5 f10 *, f6 f6 *, f0 tanh f1 sqrt *, f4 sqrt f5 stand_scaler *, f2 log f3 minmax_scaler *, f4 log f7 tanh +, f8 minmax_scaler f9 sqrt cube *]
```

Explanation of changes:
1. Used the tanh transformation on several features to explore its potential for capturing non-linear relationships.
2. Combined the `sqrt` transformation with `tanh` on multiple features for nonlinear interaction effects.
3. Added squared interactions between various key features while maintaining previous meaningful combinations.
4. Continued utilizing techniques like `log`, `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `reciprocal` for transforming features to handle skewness or high variance.

By integrating these transformations, the new feature set is oriented towards capturing more complex interactions and scale variations, potentially improving downstream predictive performance.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f11 minmax_scaler]

2026-01-13 20:04:09,709 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, we will aim to include diverse feature transformations that enhance predictive power and capture complex relationships. Here's an improved feature set using various transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f7 / f8 ,f7 * f8 ,f0 + f1 + f2 ,f5 - f6 ,f6 * f9 ,f4 reciprocal ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f7 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f9 log ,f2 log ,f5 cube / ,f11 log stand_scaler]
```

This feature set incorporates interactions between features (`f7 / f8`, `f7 * f8`), aggregates the impact of multiple features (`f0 + f1 + f2`), and applies diverse transformations such as scaling, logarithms, reciprocals, and hyperbolic functions to broaden the range of interpretations and potentially capture non-linear relationships within the data.
