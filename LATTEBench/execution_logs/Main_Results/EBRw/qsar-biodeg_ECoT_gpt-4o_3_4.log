Explanation:
1. **Various Feature Transformations**: 
   - Applying transformations like `sqrt`, `cube`, `log`, and `tanh` to uncover nonlinear relationships.
   - Used a mix of basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `*`) and transformations (`tanh`, `sqrt`) for interaction terms between features.

2. **Feature Interactions**:
   - Formed interactions between sensitive features (`f0`, `f12`, `f17`, `f26`, `f38`) based on historical data examples, potentially capturing complex biochemical interactions.
   - Included interactions like `f29 f0 f38 * cube cube` to effectively model and analyze cumulative interactions among chemically significant structural atoms.

Explanations:
- Emphasized transformations like `reciprocal` to provide alternative mathematical insights on the data.
- Balanced use of trigonometric functions `sin`, `tanh` and composition with sigmoid scale, supporting non-linear relationships exploration.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f26 ,f27 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f9 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f11 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f13 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f17 stand_scaler ,f18 stand_scaler ,f19 stand_scaler ,f20 stand_scaler ,f21 stand_scaler ,f22 stand_scaler ,f23 stand_scaler ,f24 stand_scaler ,f25 stand_scaler ,f26 stand_scaler ,f27 stand_scaler ,f28 stand_scaler ,f30 stand_scaler ,f31 stand_scaler ,f32 stand_scaler ,f33 stand_scaler ,f34 stand_scaler ,f35 stand_scaler ,f36 stand_scaler ,f37 stand_scaler ,f39 stand_scaler ,f40 stand_scaler ,f29 sigmoid ,f9 sigmoid ,f15 sigmoid ,f8 stand_scaler ,f14 f15 + ,f38 f15 + ,f14 stand_scaler ,f38 stand_scaler ,f14 f15 + stand_scaler ,f38 f15 + stand_scaler ,f0 f1 + ,f2 f3 + ,f4 f5 + ,f6 f7 tanh ,f8 f9 * ,f10 cube ,f11 cube ,f20 tanh ,f21 tanh ,f22 tanh ,f0 stand_scaler f1 stand_scaler + ,f2 stand_scaler f3 stand_scaler + ,f4 stand_scaler f5 stand_scaler + ,f6 stand_scaler f7 tanh ,f8 stand_scaler f9 tanh ,f9 tanh cube]
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Dynamic Combinations**: Features \(f0\), \(f1\), \(f2\), \(f3\), \(f4\), and \(f5\) are linearly combined to capture potential interactions.
2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Applying transformations such as `tanh` and `cube` on select features allows modeling complex relationships.
3. **Scaled Interactions**: Creating combinations using both the original and standardized versions of features can highlight variance effects.

This new feature set aims to enable the model to better capture underlying relationships in the data that could improve biodegradability predictions.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Considering both of the feature sets given, let's focus on a comprehensive transformation strategy while incorporating some new transformations that could help improve the model's predictive capabilities.

Here's a feature set that uses varied transformations:

```
[f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f6 , f7 , f9 , f10 , f12 , f13 , f14 , f15 , f17 , f18 , f19 , f21 , f22 , f23 , f26 , f27 , f28 , f32 , f33 , f35 , f36 , f37 , f40,
f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler,
f12 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f17 stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler, f21 stand_scaler, f22 stand_scaler, f23 stand_scaler, f26 stand_scaler,
f13 minmax_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f18 minmax_scaler, f28 minmax_scaler, f33 minmax_scaler, f37 minmax_scaler, f40 minmax_scaler,
f15 cube, f6 square, f9 sqrt, f27 sqrt, f28 tanh, f36 square,
f15 cube stand_scaler, f33 square stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler tanh, f3 stand_scaler, f18 log]
```

In this new feature set:

- I've kept various key features from both sets while focusing on those with higher variability and potential nonlinear relationships, like `f15` (cubed) and `f27` (square root).
- I've included some fundamental transformations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for a wider array of feature scaling.
- I've introduced `log`, `sqrt`, `square`, `cube`, and `tanh` transformations to capture nonlinear relationships.
- Combination of transformations (`cube stand_scalel`, `square stand_scaler`) to capture intricate dependencies and relationships.

This feature set aims to leverage variability, nonlinear transformations, and scaling to give a robust feature matrix for predictive modeling, potentially improving the classification task.

```

Explanation:
- Basic feature additions (`f14 f0 +` etc.) and combinations aim to capture potential interactions between features.
- The use of `sqrt`, `log`, and `tanh` functions tends to reveal non-linear patterns or normalize variations in data, which might enhance model performance.
- `sigmoid` transformations could aid in squashing range variations between 0 and 1, useful for certain classifiers and neural networks.
- Utilizing `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` helps in normalizing or standardizing features, which benefits models requiring scaled inputs.
- Finally, `reciprocal` operations might uncover features with an inverse relationship to output predictions.

Remember that ideal transformations are highly context-specific, depending on the nature of your dataset and the predictive model used.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Diverse transformations:** Including `tanh`, `reciprocal`, `sqrt`, and `log` in combination with original features can capture non-linear patterns effectively.
2. **Combinatory interactions:** Multiplying and adding feature interactions, especially between `f14`, `f38`, and others, can model underlying relationships.
3. **Scaler usage:** Applying both `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` ensures normalization of values for optimizing prediction models.
4. **Incorporate subtraction:** Adding interactions where subtraction takes place allows for unique feature differences to be captured.
5. **Complex multiplications:** Complex feature combinations using multiplication across different features can denote interactions critical for predicting biodegradability efficiently. 

This enhanced feature set should leverage the potential inherent in structured data transformations to improve the predictive capability of the downstream classification task.

This feature set will incorporate scaling, interaction terms, and non-linear transformations. Here's the improved feature set:

```

```

This new set includes:

1. **Standard Scaling** of all features to bring them to a similar scale and improve model stability.
2. **Non-linear transformations** such as `sqrt`, `square`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `reciprocal` to introduce non-linearity, possibly capturing complex patterns.
3. **Interaction terms** like `f7 f40 *`, `f38 f10 *`, `f5 f29 *`, and others to capture combined effects that may show strong correlations with the target variable.
4. Introduced **minmax scaling** to improve the range of certain variables (`f8`), further diversification of scaling methods.
5. Added more meaningful feature combinations and non-linear transformations to potentially capture richer patterns in the data.

This feature set aims to provide a comprehensive representation of the data, facilitating better prediction capability in downstream tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 15:22:03,691 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature sets you've provided, the improved feature set should aim to leverage transformations and scalings that potentially enhance the predictability of the model. The goal is to retain useful transformations while exploring additional effective operations.

Considering the examples provided, here is a feature set that builds upon them with an inclusion of varied scaling and transformation methods:

```

Changes and considerations:

- **Extensive Use of Scaling**: Continue using standard scaling extensively to ensure features are comparable in magnitude, which is beneficial for many algorithms.
- **Inclusion of Nonlinear Transformations**: Introduce additional transformations, such as square root, logarithm, and cube, to capture nonlinear relationships.
- **Variety of Aggressive Scaling/Transformations**: Incorporate min-max scaling, reciprocal, and sigmoid functions to correct skewness and enhance distributions.
- **Inclusion of Logarithmic Transformation**: Apply logarithmic transformation to potentially reduce skewness in heavily skewed data.
- **Trigonometric and Activation Functions**: Use trigonometric (sin, cos) and activation functions (tanh) to capture periodicity or complex non-linearities that might be present in some features.

This improved feature set aims to strike a balance between not overwhelming the model with transformations and ensuring the rich diversity of feature operations to encapsulate more meaningful patterns from the raw descriptors.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:22:11,724 - INFO - llm output = When generating features for better predictions, it's often beneficial to incorporate a variety of transformations to capture different aspects of the data. Below is a proposed feature set that combines elements from both examples to create a richer feature space. The goal is to balance complexity with potential predictive power.

1. Original features for context:
   - [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40]

2. Normalize and scale:
   - Use `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to get different scaling perspectives:
     - [f7 stand_scaler, f0 minmax_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler]

3. Mathematical transformations:
   - Use `cube` and `sqrt` for non-linear transformations which can sometimes help capture complex interactions:
     - [f14 cube, f38 cube, f10 cube sqrt, f29 sqrt]

4. Statistical functions:
   - Add `sigmoid` and `tanh` transformations to capture saturation behavior:
     - [f15 sigmoid, f14 tanh, f7 sin]

5. Reciprocal and power transformations:
   - Use reciprocal transformations for features where variability can be better captured as inverses, supplemented with additional complexity:
     - [f0 reciprocal cube, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f6 reciprocal cube]

6. Cross-feature interactions:
   - Allow interactions between features through multiplication or division:
     - [f7 f14 *, f7 f38 *, f7 f30 /]

7. Advanced transformations:
   - Incorporate more complex transformations like multiple `cube` operations which might capture deep interactions and dependencies:
     - [f15 sigmoid tanh, f9 tanh cube, f10 cube cube]

Combining these advanced transformations, the complete proposed feature set is:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f17, f18, f21, f22, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f32, f35, f36, f39, f40, f7 stand_scaler, f0 minmax_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f14 cube, f38 cube, f10 cube sqrt, f29 sqrt, f15 sigmoid, f14 tanh, f7 sin, f0 reciprocal cube, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f6 reciprocal cube, f7 f14 *, f7 f38 *, f7 f30 /, f15 sigmoid tanh, f9 tanh cube, f10 cube cube]

This feature set aims to leverage a variety of transformations to maximize the predictive power leveraging information captured by the original features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:22:21,300 - INFO - llm output = Given the task of improving the feature set for predicting the biodegradable nature of chemicals, here's the refined feature set based on the provided examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f17, f18, f21, f22, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f32, f35, f36, f39, f40, f38 *, f7 sqrt, f0 minmax_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f14 cube, f38 cube, f10 cube sqrt, f29 sqrt, f15 sigmoid, f14 tanh, f7 sin, f0 reciprocal cube, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f6 reciprocal cube, f7 f14 *, f7 f38 *, f7 f30 /, f15 sigmoid tanh, f9 tanh cube, f10 cube cube, f7 reciprocal sqrt]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Features and Transformations:** Retained a wide variety of base features for diversity, similar to both examples.
2. **Transformations Like Standardization & Scaling:** Included both standard scaling and min-max scaling to normalize data, a common technique to handle various scales and distributions. 
3. **Advanced Mathematical Transformations:** Preserved complex transformations such as cube, sqrt, tanh, sin, reciprocal, and sigmoid to introduce non-linearity and capture complex patterns.
4. **New Features from Operations:** Utilized operations like multiplication and division to potentially unveil interactions between features, which can be significant in capturing relationships.

This feature set aims to capture a broad, yet focused set of transformations that could enhance the model's ability to learn from the data and improve classification accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Inclusion of new operations such as `cos` and `tanh` indicates that angles or cyclical patterns might be relevant for classification.
- Using transformations such as `cos` and `sigmoid` with scaling allows capturing potential non-linearities.
- Feature combinations involving mathematical operations help uncover interactions between features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

**Rationale:**

1. **Standalone Features:** Retained individual features like `f0`, `f2`, `f10`, `f12`, etc., for diversity and embeddings.
2. **Feature Transformations:** Applied a single standard scaler to some features to normalize the data and increase reliability.
3. **Redundancy Reduction:** Limited redundant application of transformations like multiple layers of stand scaling.
4. **Enhanced Complexity:** Incorporated combinations of high-yield transformations (especially multiple layers of `stand_scaler`) to amplify important features.
5. **Non-linear Transformations:** Use of `sigmoid`, `square`, allows capturing non-linear relationships.
   
This set considers a blend of raw features and transformations while being mindful of potential overfitting—balancing complexity and interpretability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this enhanced feature set, a mix of operations such as standard scaling, quantile transformation, cube, and tanh have been applied to selected features. This variant builds upon the effective transformations seen in the latter example, adding more complexity and diversity with cube operations on certain features to potentially capture more non-linear relationships and interactions for downstream tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a feature set crafted utilizing these transformations:

```

This new feature set includes:
- Basic numerical features.
- Standard scaling to ensure features have mean zero and standard deviation of one.
- Higher-order scaling to further normalize some features.
- Trigonometric transformations (sin, cos, and tanh) to capture periodic trends.
- Mathematical interactions including addition, multiplication.
- Logarithmic and cube transformations for non-linear principal relationships.

In this set:
- Each original feature is included to maintain the ability to compare baseline transformations.
- Diverse transformations such as `log`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `cube`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` are applied to spread the feature values across different scales and distributions.
- `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are used on select features to normalize them for model stability and improve interpretability.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Existing features**: We retain all the original features and their transformations.
   
2. **Additional Transformation**:
   - `f7 f14 * f15 cos`: A cosine transformation added on the product of existing features to potentially capture additional periodic patterns.
   - `f9 f13 /`: Division of two features to investigate ratio effects.
   - `f19 f16 * tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent applied after multiplying two features to explore saturation effects.
   - `f8 f17 * sqrt`: Square root transformation after multiplying two features, emphasizing the influence of smaller values.
   - `f5 f6 tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent transformation to capture non-linear relationships from the combined feature.
   - `f18 log`: Log transformation to handle skewness/spread in the data for this particular feature.

This enhanced feature set incorporates more sophisticated feature interactions and transformations, possibly improving the predictive performance of the downstream task while maintaining the original format.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:23:32,586 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, the latter feature set makes use of both squared transformations and the stand_scaler, which can help normalize the features and potentially enhance model performance. It also combines additional non-linear transformations such as cube, log, and sigmoid, which introduce more flexibility in capturing complex patterns in the data.

Here's a new feature set proposal:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f8 ,f10 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f26 ,f27 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 f7 * stand_scaler ,f29 tanh ,f8 stand_scaler stand_scaler ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f12 cube ,f13 cube ,f14 square ,f30 log ,f38 sigmoid ,f10 f14 * ,f38 f15 * ,f8 f29 / ,f7 square stand_scaler ,f27 reciprocal ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f15 f30 * ,f31 sqrt ,f39 sqrt ,f40 sqrt]
```

This improved feature set includes additional transformations such as square and cube for features f14 and f12, respectively, introduces tanh for non-linearity on f29, and extensively employs normalization techniques like stand_scaler and sigmoid. It also introduces divisions and multiplication to pivot off interactions between selected features, potentially capturing interactions and intricate patterns that might enhance predictive capabilities.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Key improvements include:
- Inclusion of additional transformations like `sqrt`, `cube`, `tanh`, and `sin` to explore non-linear relationships.
- More focus on scaling and normalization techniques such as `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`.
- Combining features using arithmetic operations (`*`), and applying transformations on these combinations (e.g., `cube`, `tanh`, `sin`) to capture potential interactions.
- Including reciprocal transformation for exploring hyperbolic relationships with `f39`.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here is a suggested improved feature set:

This set maintains robust scaling and extends deeper nesting where it might capture more nuanced patterns. It balances between the number of transformations and the depth of these transformations to potentially uncover complex interactions within the dataset.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

When creating a new feature set, the goal is to extract more information from existing features while maintaining a balanced approach between simplicity and complexity. Given the operations available, here's a new feature set example that might be more effective for downstream tasks:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40,

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Basic Feature Reuse**: Retained the original features (f0 to f40) for maintaining essential data structure.

2. **Transformations**: Applied various mathematical transformations such as `minmax_scaler`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `reciprocal` to enhance variability and capture nonlinear patterns.

3. **Cubing and Squaring**: Used `cube` and `square` on select features (f14, f38) to allow exploration of higher-order relationships.

4. **Combinations of Features**: Included combinations of core interactions such as f7*f14, f14+f38, and used `log`, `sin` and `cos` operations to introduce non-linear interaction explorations.

The focus was put on transforming key features that likely have nonlinear effects on the target variable. By considering interactions and transformations, we aim to capture more complex relationships in the data while ensuring meaningful data diversification.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:24:02,185 - INFO - llm output = Given the two examples provided, the latter feature set has incorporated transformations such as standard scaling, sine, cosine, division, square root, and multiplication, enhancing specificity and potentially improving the predictive power of the model. However, to further enhance the feature set, consider the following improvements:

1. Increase feature transformations diversity by adding other non-linear transformations like sigmoid, cube, or reciprocal.
2. Improve interaction terms through more complex arithmetic operations.
3. Enhance feature normalization through quantile transformation.

Here's an improved feature set based on these suggestions:

```

f0 f1 +, f7 f8 *, f12 f13 -, f8 f9 /, f7 f14 * sin, 
[f7 stand_scaler] quantile_transform]

This improved feature set increases the complexity of transformations, diversifies interaction terms, and enhances feature normalization, potentially improving the prediction accuracy in the downstream task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:24:13,750 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the given examples, let's leverage a combination of transformations, including scaling, nonlinear transformations, and interactions between features. This will potentially capture more complex relationships and enhance predictive performance for the classification task.

Here is the proposed new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f7 sigmoid ,f29 sigmoid ,f8 sigmoid ,f8 * f29 ,f4 / f8 ,f10 square ,f15 sigmoid ,f30 stand_scaler ,f30 square ,f29 stand_scaler ,f29 stand_scaler stand_scaler ,f16 * f17 ,f6 cube ,f3 sqrt]
```

**Explanation:** 

- **Scaling and Transformation:** Apply standard scaling (stand_scaler) to features that might be influential, such as `f7`, `f8`, `f29`, and `f30`, to ensure they have similar importance in models.
- **Nonlinear Transformations:** Use sigmoid and square transformations to `f7`, `f15`, `f29`, and `f10`, which can capture non-linear relationships and impact model performance.
- **Interaction Terms:** Create interaction terms such as `f8 * f29` and `f16 * f17` to capture the combined effects of different molecular descriptors which reflect potential biochemical interactions.
- **Power and Root Transformations:** Utilize cube (`f6 cube`) and square root (`f3 sqrt`) transformations to reflect different scales and distributions.
- **Feature Ratios:** A ratio `f4 / f8` reflects relative proportions that can capture molecular structure distinctions between compounds.

These transformations, especially with interactions and ratio features, aim to enhance the potential for the model to uncover significant biochemistry-driven differences vital for classifying biodegradability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Explanation:
- **Combined Operations**: Using more combinations and interactions of initial features (like `f7 f14 * f30 +`) allows the model to capture non-linear relationships better.
- **Variety of Transformations**: Applying diverse transformations such as `log`, `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `sinh`, and `sigmoid` aids in capturing different aspects of the data distribution.
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Consistent use of `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans` and `minmax_scaler` helps in addressing feature distribution disparities.
  
This set leverages non-linear transformations alongside interaction terms for a richer representation, thus improving model prediction without overly complicating the feature space.

```

### Explanation:
- **Standardization & Scaling**: Applying `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` strategically to selected features, which can help normalize the range and impact of these features on predictions.
  
- **Non-linear Transformations**: Using `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `sqrt`, `cube`, and combinations thereof to capture non-linear patterns and interactions inherent in the molecular descriptors.

- **Reciprocal Transformations**: Applying reciprocal transformations to reduce the influence of larger values and amplify the impact of smaller values on predictions.

- **Logarithmic Transformations**: Using `log` transformation on specific features that could benefit from scaling down wide variances.

- **Feature Interaction**: Creating new features by combining existing ones in mathematically meaningful ways through operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and complex operations involving multiple transformations.

This set maintains the balance between complexity and interpretability, generating novel insights from interactions and transformations.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's an improved feature set:

```

Here, I've combined elements from both previous examples:

- Used transformations like `sqrt`, `cube`, `sigmoid`, `log`, and `reciprocal` on selected features to capture non-linear relationships.
- Introduced a few interactions (e.g., `f0 f38 f40 *`) and selected key features for transformations based on their unique attributes.
- Integrated multiple occurrences of `sqrt`, `tanh`, or `stand_scaler` to ensure useful scaling and non-linear transformations across different features.
- Ensured that there’s diversity in the types of operations applied, yet with an emphasis on meaningful interactions and transformations, potentially improving the model’s ability to predict the target classes.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's a proposed feature set that builds on the previous examples:

f15 sigmoid stand_scaler stand_scaler, 
f8 sqrt stand_scaler stand_scaler, 
f8 minmax_scaler stand_scaler, 
f14 tanh stand_scaler stand_scaler]
```

Changes from the second example:
1. Introduced `sqrt` transformation on `f29` within the `stand_scaler` context to capture non-linear variance.
2. Used `square` and `cube` in combination with `stand_scaler stand_scaler` to capture higher-order effects for features `f7` and `f10`.
3. Applied `tanh` transformation on `f14` within `stand_scaler stand_scaler`, enhancing ability to capture saturation effects.
4. Combined `sigmoid` and `stand_scaler stand_scaler` transformations on `f15`, leveraging non-linear property.

Considering both the variance capture and non-linear transformations enhances the complex relationships within your data set, potentially leading to better predictive power in your classification task.

2026-01-12 15:24:59,472 - INFO - llm output = Given the feature sets and operations provided, we want to create a new and improved feature set that enhances predictive performance by incorporating transformations and scaling techniques in strategic ways. Both examples provided include various combinations of raw features and transformations such as scaling, sigmoid, cube, and square operations. The latter example includes a wider variety of transformations, suggesting that experimentation with different transformations could be beneficial. Let's build a new feature set using principles seen in both examples, but we'll introduce more advanced transformations for broader feature coverage and potential non-linear effects.

Here is the new improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f4, f6, f10, f12, f13, f14, f17, f21, f26, f29, f32, f35, f36, f38, f40,

 f17 stand_scaler tanh cube, f21 stand_scaler tanh cube, f2 sqrt]
```

Key improvements:
1. **Diverse Transformations**: Introduced a mix of transformations like `minmax_scaler`, `cube`, `sqrt`, and `log` to capture various non-linear relationships.
2. **Advanced Combinations**: Combined transformations like `stand_scaler tanh cube` to handle complex relationships that linear transformations cannot.
3. **Broader Feature Coverage**: Enhanced the coverage with multiple raw and transformed features to leverage various levels of feature interactions and complexity.
4. **Increased Testing for Non-Linearity**: Utilized functions like `sqrt`, `cube`, and `log` that may uncover hidden non-linear relationships, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:25:11,664 - INFO - llm output = Creating a better feature set involves considering both complexity and variability, while also ensuring that features can effectively capture the relationships within the data. The latter feature set benefits from employing a range of transformations and scalings extensively, particularly the quantile transformation, which can be effective in handling skewed distributions and ensuring that features follow a Gaussian-like distribution, useful for many machine learning models.

Here is an improved feature set based on the previous examples:

```

```

Here, some advanced mathematical transformations (sin, cos, tanh) and interactions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are included to capture more non-linear relationships potentially present in the data.

```

Summary of modifications:
1. Introduced additional normalization techniques (e.g., stand_scaler on more features).
2. Explored interactions between features such as `f7*f21*`, `f7*f21*cos`.
3. Applied transformations (e.g., `square`, `reciprocal`, `sigmoid`) to diversify feature representation.
4. Used mathematical operations on combinations of features to extract higher-level interactions (`f7*f14*f15 +`, `f7*f21*f19-`). 

This feature set aims to retain meaningful information while enhancing the model's capacity to capture intricate patterns within the data.

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Diversity**: We've included a mix of polynomial, transcendental, and statistical transformations, which increases the discriminative power by capturing different aspects of data distributions.
   
2. **Logarithmic and Reciprocal Transformations**: Logarithms and reciprocals are useful for handling skewed data distribution, which can often be found in chemical data sets.

3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Including transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and cubes harnesses the non-linear relationships in the data which could be vital for capturing complex interactions.

4. **Normalized Features**: The use of `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` assists in reducing variability, making the model stable and less sensitive to scale which ultimately helps in convergence during training.

5. **Interaction Terms**: Terms like `f10 f14 *`, `f8 f29 /`, and `f4 f6 +` help capture interactions between variables which could be significant predictors in biodegradability assessments.

This feature set is designed to leverage a comprehensive array of transformations which, when subject to model training, are likely to offer improved predictions through enriched attribute formulation.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set:
- I've abstracted both standard scaling and quantile transformation on `f7` to encapsulate its distribution better.
- Incorporated more trigonometric operations (`cos`, `sin`, `tanh`) to introduce non-linear characteristics into multiple features.
- Combined features such as `f7` and `f14` with various operations like cube and square for higher order effects.
- Added transformations like 'sqrt' and composite operations involving division to capture interaction effects between features.
- Retained combinations such as multiplying `f7`, `f14`, and `f38` with various transformed features to explore cross-feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a newly suggested feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 , f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f5 , f6 , f7 , f8 , f10 , f12 , f13 , f14 , f15 , f16 , f17 , f20 , f22 , f23 , f26 , f27 , f29 , f30 , f32 , f33 , f34 , f35 , f36 , f37 , f38 , f40 , f7 f7 * stand_scaler , f8 stand_scaler stand_scaler , f29 tanh , f12 sqrt , f13 cube , f14 square , f30 log , f38 sigmoid , f10 f14 * , f38 f15 * , f8 f29 / , f7 square stand_scaler , f27 reciprocal , f16 sqrt , f17 sqrt , f20 sqrt , f22 reciprocal , f20 f31 + , f12 f10 / , f29 sqrt , f38 tanh , f30 log square]
```

In this set:
- Retained and emphasized features likely neutral or important in the classification task based on statistical center and spread (staying closer to the median and quartiles).
- Used diverse transformations to capture non-linear and interaction effects (e.g., sqrt, cube, tanh, sigmoid).
- Removed operations on less critical features based on statistical summary (low mean and close quartile ranges for categorical-like features).
- Scaled combinations of interactions with features that may have complementary effects (e.g., `f8 f29 /` that examines the ratio between highly variable features).
- Incorporated square and reciprocal operations to intensify extremely low or high values, which might help increase contrast between the two classes.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
1. Retained operations for f7 and f29 stand scaling and sigmoid because they are common in both sets.
2. Included f17 * f16 and f6 cube as feature engineering might be significant for modeling interactions and nonlinear relationships.
3. Added f30 sqrt and f4 / f8, retaining earlier transformation concepts from the first set.
4. Expansion using f29 stand_scaler stand_scaler to enhance variability and model robustness.
5. Introduced f16 * f15 using interaction terms assumed in the second set to capture more variability.
6. Combined f29 sigmoid * f30 square to potentially enhance model distinction between classes.

2026-01-12 15:26:21,395 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and the goal of improving feature transformations for better predictions, I will propose a new feature set building upon the transformations and ensure they are more comprehensive:

- Original Features: 
  [f0, f1, f2, f4, f6, f7, f10, f12, f13, f14, f17, f21, f22, f26, f27, f29, f32, f33, f35, f36, f38, f40]

- Standard Scaler Transformations (first level):
  - Apply standard scaling to features to normalize and center around zero: 
    [f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f17 stand_scaler, f21 stand_scaler, f22 stand_scaler, f26 stand_scaler, f27 stand_scaler, f32 stand_scaler, f33 stand_scaler, f35 stand_scaler, f36 stand_scaler, f38 stand_scaler, f40 stand_scaler]

- Additional Transformations:
  - Sigmoid transformation on feature 29 to reduce effects of extreme values:
    [f29 sigmoid]

  - Min-max scaling for enhanced normalization:
    [f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f10 sqrt minmax_scaler, f21 sqrt minmax_scaler, f22 sqrt minmax_scaler, f26 minmax_scaler, f27 minmax_scaler, f32 minmax_scaler, f33 minmax_scaler, f35 minmax_scaler, f36 minmax_scaler, f38 minmax_scaler, f40 minmax_scaler]

  - Composite features using basic arithmetic operations to capture interactions:
    - Element-wise multiplication to capture interaction between pairs:
      [f30 f10 * minmax_scaler, f7 f29 * minmax_scaler]

    - Sine, cosine transformation to introduce nonlinearity-based features:
      [f21 cos, f22 sin]

  - Recursive Standard Scaler Transformations (second level):
    - Further standard scaling to refine normalization:
      [f0 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f17 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f26 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f27 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f32 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f35 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f36 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f40 stand_scaler stand_scaler]

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

In this improved feature set, I retained the useful transformations such as `stand_scaler` applied to most features for normalization, and built on them with complex transformations that were unique like `cube`, `sigmoid`, and combinations involving trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`). This helps maintain the variability and complexity of new features while ensuring they are standardized, contributing effectively to predictive capabilities.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 15:26:39,279 - INFO - llm output = To derive a better feature set based on the given examples, we can combine techniques from both examples, focusing on improving the representation ability and exploring new transformations. The latter example introduced a lot of scaling and quantile transformation, which are useful for normalizing data and dealing with non-linearities. Let's also incorporate some transformations from the first example to enrich the feature set further.

Here is a proposed better feature set combining ideas from both examples:

```plaintext

```

This feature set maintains the normalization benefits from the stand_scaler and quan_trans operations, while also introducing some non-linear transformation diversity from the first example, such as sin and tanh, potentially capturing more complex relationships within the data.
