- The sum (f2 f3 +) and product (f2 f3 *) of f2 and f3 to capture potential interactions.
- The combination (f2 f2 + f3 f3 + +) to explore composite feature effects.
- The cube transformations of f2 and f3 to capture non-linear effects.
- The min-max scaling of f2 and f3 to normalize and potentially improve learning algorithms.
- Multiplications of f0 and f1 with f4, retaining the combinations from the second set.
- Sigmoid transformations applied after certain interactions to introduce non-linearity in feature representations.

2026-01-13 11:21:17,235 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set, we can aim to capture more complex relationships and transformations that might be beneficial for the model's understanding. Given the transformations and mathematical operations suggested in the example feature sets, I'll propose a new feature set below:

1. Combine multiple operations on `f4` with a focus on capturing non-linear transformations that can be useful in predictions.
2. Use combinations and transformations that increase complexity while considering computational efficiency and interpretability.
3. Focus on higher-order interactions and non-linear transformations, as seen in the example sets.

Here's the proposed feature set:

``` 
[f4 cube sqrt tanh ,f4 sqrt tanh ,f4 sqrt square sqrt sin ,f4 cube square sqrt f4 sqrt + ,f4 square f1 tanh + ,f4 f1 f3 square sqrt + + f1 sqrt sqrt f4 square + + ,f4 f3 sqrt + f1 cube f1 cube sqrt + + f4 square f1 + + ,f4 cube f4 cube sin sqrt square + sin f4 + ,f4 f3 cube sqrt sin + f1 f4 square tanh + + ,f4 f1 cube sqrt f4 f4 cube + + sin ,f4 cube sqrt tanh f1 cube sqrt + ,f4 cube f4 cube tanh sqrt f1 f3 sqrt sin + f4 square +] 
```

In this set:
- Non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sin`, and `sqrt` are applied multiple times and in combination with other operations to capture complex patterns.
- The operations aim to generate features that are not only diverse but also potentially reduce the dimensionality of high-value features, thus enabling the model to better capture the impact of the original features.

The postfix notation allows us to manipulate existing features and their transformations.

To generate a new and potentially better feature set, we can draw inspiration from both examples and include transformations that are likely to capture diverse interactions and non-linearities better. We will also consider operations that were effective in your examples.

Here's one possible improved feature set based on the given examples:

- We retained the cubes of some features to capture non-linear relationships.
- We included additional combinations such as `f0 f1 +` and `f2 f3 *` to potentially capture feature interactions that might be relevant.
- `f0 f4 tanh` and `f1 f4 tanh` are added to explore non-linear saturation effects.
- `f0 f3 /` and `f3 f4 /` are included to capture potential relative effects between features.

This mix aims to explore a broad set of feature interactions and transformations that might contribute more effectively to distinguishing between the classes.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:22:00,766 - INFO - llm output = For the task of transforming the feature set, we aim to create new features that might capture non-linear relationships or scale the features to help the model learn better. Based on the two provided sets of features, the second provided set includes some cubic transformations and product features, but the first set additionally includes `tanh` transformations of `f0` and `f1`, which are useful for normalizing features to a range between -1 and 1.

To design a better feature set, we can integrate non-linear transformations and scaling, including logarithmic, square root, and reciprocal transformations, which often help in capturing different feature distributions. Here’s a refined feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f0 cube ,f1 cube ,f2 cube ,f3 cube ,f0 f4 * ,f1 f4 * ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f0 log ,f1 sqrt ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 square]
```

This set includes:
- Cubic transformations of `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, which help capture non-linear patterns.
- Product features `f0 f4 *` and `f1 f4 *` to consider interaction terms.
- `tanh` transformed `f0` and `f1` for normalization.
- Logarithmic transformation of `f0` to reduce skewness.
- Square root transformation of `f1` to manage skewness in a different way.
- Reciprocal transformation of `f2`, providing inverse scaling which can be particularly useful for highly varying distributions.
- Square transformation of `f3`, again capturing non-linear effects. 

These transformations aim to provide a broad set of features that could capture various underlying patterns in data, potentially improving predictive power.

### Explanation:

1. **Retained Transformations from Examples:**
   - Cubes and squares of the initial features provide non-linear relationships.
   - Stand-scaler and logarithmic transformations help in normalizing and handling skewness in data.
   - Interaction terms like `f0 f4 *` capture multiplicative relationships.

2. **Added Transformations and Interactions:**
   - Additional squares and cubes of `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` for deeper non-linear exploration.
   - Added combinations and interactions like `f0 f1 +`, `f0 f2 +`, etc., to capture linear relationships between features.
   - Included ratios like `f0 f1 * f2 /` to capture proportional relationships.

This combined approach uses both non-linear transformations and interactions to potentially improve prediction accuracy by capturing more complex relationships.

4. Combines the quantile transformation of f2 with a tanh transformation on f1 to reduce skewness and map to a nonlinear distribution.
5. Uses a min-max scaling on f4 in division with f3 to normalize and capture ratios.
6. Further explores cyclical nature by multiplying the sine of f4 with the cosine of f3.
7. Adds f4 with its sine transformation to assess its variation from a standard reference point.

Here's a new feature set given the previous examples:

```

Explanation:
- Addition of `f4 reciprocal` and `f2 log`: These transformations can help capture inverse and logarithmic relationships.
- `f1 f4 - sqrt`: Introducing a square root transformation after subtracting `f4` from `f1` can help model certain nonlinear relationships more smoothly.
- Retained `f1 f4 - cube` from the previous examples to further capture nonlinearity.

These transformations, combined with the previous sets, aim to offer deeper insights into patterns and relationships within the data that are potentially useful for the downstream predictive task.

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Selection**: I retained most of the diverse transformation operations applied to features \(f1\), \(f2\), \(f3\), and \(f4\) because they provide a rich set of derived features that may capture non-linear relationships and distributions in the data. 

2. **Quantile Transformation**: This method is robust for non-normal feature distributions. The additional quantile transformation on \(f1 f4 -\) (difference of features), may provide a normalized difference feature capturing important variation.

3. **Diversity of Operations**: A combination of operations like stand_scaler, reciprocal, log, sqrt, and cube are included to ensure a comprehensive range of potential non-linear relationships and handling of skewed data.

By extending the transformation set with these additional features, you gain a better ability to capture different feature behaviors and relationships, which can enhance the downstream prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Here are some of the enhancements and considerations made:

1. Inclusion of the original features for interpretability.
2. Incorporation of higher-order interactions among features using multiplication and addition.
3. Utilization of multiple transformation functions including log, sqrt, and reciprocal for handling skewed data distributions.
4. Usage of both simple and complex feature interactions and transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
5. Inclusion of quantile transformations for normalizing skewed data and enhancing the robustness of the predictive model.

2026-01-13 11:23:43,200 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, here is a new, improved feature set. This set aims to capture the most informative transformations and combinations of the features relevant to predicting the target variable.

The goal is to balance the complexity and the predictive power of the features, while considering the numerical properties and relationships that might exist between them:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f0 square ,f4 log ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f0 f1 * ,f1 f3 + ,f0 f4 * ,f0 f1 * f2 / ,f3 f4 / ,f3 sin ,f0 cube ,f1 tanh ,f0 f3 - ]
```

### Explanation of Key Features:

1. **f0 square, f4 log**: Squares and logarithms are basic transformations that help manage linearity or log-linear relationships in data.

2. **f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling normalizes the features and can stabilize the variance, particularly useful when the range of values is large.

3. **f0 f1 * and f1 f3 +**: Combination of features to capture potential interactive effects between the father's and son's occupations, and the race, which might jointly influence outcomes.

4. **f0 f4 ***: Multiplicative interaction reflecting potential influence of father's occupation and the adjusted son’s occupation.

5. **f3 sin**: Applying the sine transformation to f3 might reveal periodic or cyclical patterns, although not common, this can capture unique patterns.

6. **f0 cube**: Cubing adds non-linearity that can capture more complex relationships beyond linear and quadratic terms.

7. **f1 tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent can normalize extreme values, often more robust to outliers than sigmoid.

8. **f0 f3 -**: Subtractive interaction, potentially useful to capture relationships like differences influencing the target.

The constructed feature set is meant to help incorporate the underlying distribution and relationships observed in family disruption studies and their intricate effects on social mobility and occupational outcomes.

2026-01-13 11:24:07,703 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new and improved feature set based on the provided examples, I aim to derive features that capture non-linear relationships, interactions, and transformations that may enhance the predictive power for your classification task. Here’s a proposed feature set:

1. Retain the original features as a base.
2. Introduce interaction terms.
3. Employ transformations to capture non-linearities and standardize features.

Let's create a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f3 cube, f4 cube, f0 f1 *, f0 f4 *, f1 f4 *, f2 square, f3 f4 sqrt *]
```

### Explanation:
- `f0, f1, f2, f3, f4`: Retaining original features ensures that all information is captured.
- `f3 cube`: Provides non-linear transformation based on `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
- `f4 cube`: Additional cube transformation captures non-linear effects more robustly.
- `f0 f1 *`: Interaction between father's and son's occupation may capture significant effects.
- `f0 f4 *` and `f1 f4 *`: Multiply by `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` for scaling and interaction.
- `f2 square`: Squaring `family_structure` might help capture more significant effects of the category.
- `f3 f4 sqrt *`: Interaction with square root transformation, which can help in scaling and easing the interpretability of interaction.

These derived features aim to improve the classifier's ability to separate the classes by providing new perspectives on the relationships in the data.

2026-01-13 11:24:16,016 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and considering the downstream task of predicting the binary classes for sons' current occupation, we aim to generate a feature set that captures important non-linear interactions between the features, while also applying various transformations to normalize and standardize the data. Here's a new feature set that builds upon the provided examples:

```plaintext
[f2, f3, f4, f0 f4 *, f1 f4 *, f3 cube sigmoid, f0 f4 * sigmoid, f1 f4 * sigmoid, f0 tanh, f1 tanh, f4 log, f4 sqrt, f0 f4 * cube, f1 f4 * cube, f0 f4 * sqrt, f1 f4 * sqrt, f3 cube quan_trans, f2 cube, f0 f4 * reciprocal, f1 f4 * reciprocal, f3 f4 * tanh, f2 f4 * sqrt, f2 f0 /, f3 f1 *, f0 f1 +, f4 f0 f1 * *, f3 log, f2 tanh]
```

**Explanation and Rationale:**

1. **Retained Transformations:** We've retained powerful transformations like `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `reciprocal` which can help capture complex non-linear relationships.

2. **Interaction Terms:** The interaction terms like `f0 f4 *`, `f1 f4 *`, `f3 f4 *`, and combinations like `f0 f1 +` are crucial for understanding feature interactions that might be significant for the target variable.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction:** By using operations like `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, and normalized sigmoids, we can reduce dimensional complexity, making the feature set more amenable to training without losing significant information.

4. **Quantile Transformation:** Including `quan_trans` ensures that any skewness in the distributions is mitigated, which can improve model robustness.

5. **Balancing Features and Transformations:** The mix of raw, interaction, and transformed features provides a well-rounded dataset that can capture a range of patterns in the data.

This enhanced feature set should provide a good balance of complexity and efficiency, potentially improving the predictive performance of models tasked with classifying the counts for sons' current occupation.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f4 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler reciprocal ,f4 stand_scaler reciprocal reciprocal]
 
 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f4 sqrt]

2026-01-13 11:24:48,909 - INFO - llm output = A good approach to creating a new feature set is to consider transformations that capture non-linear relationships and variations in scale. Considering the given examples, I will create a new feature set that combines some transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f4 minmax_scaler, f4 log]
