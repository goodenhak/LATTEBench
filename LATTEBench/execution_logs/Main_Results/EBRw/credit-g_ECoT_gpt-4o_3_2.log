2026-01-12 10:51:37,099 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, it's important to leverage the transformations that can highlight meaningful patterns or relationships in the data while aiming for diversity in transformation types to capture nonlinearities. Here’s a proposed feature set based on the given examples:

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f5 ,f11 ,f12 ,f15 ,f17 ,f0 reciprocal ,f12 cos ,f4 stand_scaler ,f0 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f13 stand_scaler ,f14 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f17 stand_scaler ,f19 stand_scaler ,f12 cos stand_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f4 reciprocal minmax_scaler ,f0 sin ,f2 sin ,f11 sin ,f4 reciprocal sin ,f12 cos sin ,f0 stand_scaler sin ,f2 stand_scaler sin ,f7 stand_scaler sin ,f13 stand_scaler sin ,f17 stand_scaler sin ,f4 reciprocal stand_scaler sin ,f12 cos stand_scaler sin ,f8 f3 + cube ,f1 tanh]

### Explanation:
1. **Diverse Transformations**: The feature set includes a variety of transformations such as `cos`, `reciprocal`, `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `sin`, and `cube`. These transformations can capture different aspects of nonlinearity and data distributions, improving predictive modeling.

2. **Significant Base Features**: Features are selected that represent key aspects of financial data, such as `f0`, `f1`, `f4`, `f5`, `f11`, `f12`, `f15`, `f17` — likely corresponding to important attributes like checking account status, credit amount, savings status, etc.

3. **Combined Transformations**: The use of multiple transformation layers on certain features, like `f4 reciprocal minmax_scaler` and `f12 cos stand_scaler sin`, aims to uncover complex interactions that might provide additional insights for prediction tasks.

4. **Cube Transformation**: Using the cube transformation on `f8 f3 +` intends to enhance the magnitude effect of combined features, capturing a potential relationship between credit purpose and history.

2026-01-12 10:51:45,307 - INFO - llm output = To enhance feature engineering based on the examples provided and improve the predictions, we can generate a new feature set using a combination of transformations and interactions between features. The new feature set should aim to capture complex relationships and variations that are informative for the classification task.

Here's a better feature set considering the previous examples:

```

```

Explanation:
- I've retained the original features (f0 to f19) to ensure basic information is not lost.
- I included transformations like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `cube` to normalize and emphasize the non-linear relationships.
- New combinations using multiplication, addition, division, and mathematical function transformations (e.g., `cos`, `tanh`, `log`, and `sqrt`) to capture interactions between features more effectively. 
- The goal is to balance between maintaining feature integrity while exploring transformations that may uncover hidden patterns in the data relevant to credit approval prediction.

- I included `f1 square` to explore the non-linear relationship of the feature `f1`, which might exhibit quadratic behavior.
- The term `f13 f9 +` adds two feature values together, possibly capturing interactions or dependencies that might be overlooked individually.
- The term `f3 f15 *` multiplies two features, which could highlight nonlinear interactions between those features.

Additions to consider include enhanced interactions between features with `+` and transformations like `log`, `tanh`, and `stand_scaler` to increase non-linearity and standardization effects. Transformations like `log` and `tanh` maintain non-linearity and might assist in exposing relationships between predictors not captured linearly. Standard scaling helps normalize the feature space.

- `f4 log`: Using logarithmic transformation on f4 can manage skewness effectively and bring values to a smaller scale.
- `f4 minmax_scaler`: Scaling feature f4 between its minimum and maximum allows for easier comparison across features.
- `f12 reciprocal`: Applying a reciprocal can accentuate differences in smaller values of f12, which might be useful if it contains inverse relationships.
- `f1 log`: As logarithm transformation was applied to f1 in the first example, we're including it for managing potential skewness in this feature.

By combining transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, `minmax_scaler`, and `reciprocal`, this feature set offers a robust way to handle both linear and non-linear relationships, as well as normalize the range and distribution of numerical features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 10:52:07,275 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using postfix expressions for feature engineering, we can focus on creating meaningful features that might capture interactions and transformations more effectively.

Given the two examples, we can aim to refine the feature set by combining operations that capture non-linear transformations and interactions between features, potentially retaining and enhancing predictive power.

Here's an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f4 f4 *, f4 sqrt, f1 f2 *, f3 log, f5 f6 /, f10 f0 *, f8 f9 * tanh, f12 f13 +, f14 square]
```

This feature set includes:

- Basic original features.
- Existing feature f4 multiplied by itself to capture its quadratic effect.
- Square root transformation on the feature f4, which can sometimes help with capturing scale differences.
- Interaction (multiplication) between f1 and f2 to capture potential synergy.
- Log transformation on f3 to handle skewness and capture relative changes.
- Division interaction between f5 and f6 to assess relative importance.
- Interaction between f10 and f0.
- Multiplication followed by hyperbolic tangent transformation (tanh) between f8 and f9 to capture non-linearity.
- Addition of f12 and f13 for potential linear interaction.
- Square transformation on f14 to capture scale/non-linear effects. 

These transformations aim to improve model predictions by enhancing feature interactions and transformations that might be informative for the target task.

2026-01-12 10:52:25,633 - INFO - llm output = To provide an improved feature set according to the examples given, let's balance complexity with meaningful transformations. The second feature set example has many repetitive transformations, which may lead to redundancy and overfitting. Here is a new feature set that attempts to prioritize meaningful transformations while avoiding excessive repetition:

```text

f0 stand_scaler stand_scaler stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler stand_scaler stand_scaler,
f0 stand_scaler stand_scaler stand_scaler stand_scaler]
```

**Explanation:**

- Retain both original features and key transformations such as `stand_scaler` for normalization across multiple features (f0, f1, f2, etc.).
- Introduce `square` and `cube` transformations for select features to capture nonlinear relationships (f6, f8, f19 for `square` and f10, f11 for `cube`).
- Use the `tanh` function on select features (f2, f3, f5, f7, f13, f17) to account for potential saturation effects.
- Limit the quantity of higher-level chained transformations (e.g., `stand_scaler stand_scaler stand_scaler stand_scaler`) to control complexity.
This approach should enhance the predictive power of the feature set while maintaining concise transformations that capture essential data relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this new feature set:
- We've retained the original features and added both scaling and transformation techniques.
- Applied `minmax_scaler` to f0 for normalization of primary features.
- Combined square transformation, sigmoid, reciprocal followed by cube transformation on f1 for enhanced feature interaction.
- Applied `cube` transformation largely from the second example to capture possible polynomial relationships.
- Retained the original and transformed versions to provide a wide variety of features for modeling.

2026-01-12 10:52:39,665 - INFO - llm output = To enhance the feature set further, we can incorporate transformation techniques that may improve the predictive power of the model. Here is a refined feature set considering the previous two examples and aiming for more complex transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f4 reciprocal, f4 * f0 sigmoid, f0 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f9 reciprocal, f9 log, f1 cube, f12 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, f16 sin, f16 cos, f17 stand_scaler, f18 stand_scaler, f12 tanh, f19 tanh, f4 reciprocal quan_trans, f4 sigmoid quan_trans, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f12 stand_scaler, f11 sqrt, f10 square, f6 minmax_scaler]
```

This feature set introduces the following enhancements:
- **Combining transformations**: Applying reciprocal and sigmoid together (`f4 * f0 sigmoid`) to possibly capture non-linear interactions.
- **Cubic transformation on `f1`**: Exploring higher-order polynomial effects, which can be particularly useful for capturing non-linearities in features strongly associated with the target variable.
- **Additional transformations**: Introducing additional square and square root transformations, and min-max scaling on selected features (`f11 sqrt`, `f10 square`, `f6 minmax_scaler`) to normalize the range of numerical features or to adjust for variance.

These transformations are meant to extract novel, potentially intricate patterns in the data that could improve model generalization and predictive accuracy.

2026-01-12 10:52:44,017 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature engineering examples provided, the latter set of transformed features tends to include more of the original features in their raw form alongside a few strategically applied transformations. This balances introducing non-linearities through transformations with retaining valuable raw information, which can often aid in improving model predictions.

Given these observations, a better feature set could be constructed by incorporating more variations of transformations such as scaling, non-linear functions, and normalization techniques, ensuring it captures a variety of possible interactions or scales. Here is a proposed better feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f4 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f4 sigmoid ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f11 sqrt ,f8 tanh ,f17 log ,f4 reciprocal]
```

This set includes the original features, specific scaling for important features (f4 and f1), introduces transformations that might highlight unique distributions or handle skewness (log for f17, reciprocal for f4), and nonlinear transformations to introduce more complexity where appropriate (tanh for f8, sqrt for f11). This aims to capture different aspects and interaction nuances of the data, potentially improving prediction outcomes.

We'll introduce diversity in transformations and aim for depth and richness in feature derivations.

Here's an improved feature set:

```

Here's a breakdown of the transformations applied:

- Combined raw features with reciprocal and square transformations for enhanced non-linearity.
- Included min-max scaling and standard scaling to normalize features that vary widely in scale.
- Used sigmoid and tanh for their smoothing and saturation properties.
- Introduced logarithm and cube transformations for different types of non-linear transformations.

2026-01-12 10:53:02,612 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two provided examples, let's focus on incorporating transformations that capture non-linear relationships and interactions effectively, while reducing dimensionality where possible.

Given that both examples utilize a variety of transformations, we'll consolidate them by selecting a balanced range of operations that are likely to capture the necessary complexity of the underlying patterns, incorporating operations such as transformations, scaling, and interactions without excessive redundancy.

Here is the proposed improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f9, f10, f11, f14, f15, f17, f18, f4 reciprocal, f4 * f0 minmax_scaler, f5 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f9 reciprocal, f9 log, f1 cube, f10 square, f14 reciprocal, f16 sin, f16 cos, f17 stand_scaler, f12 tanh, f4 reciprocal quan_trans, f4 * f0 sigmoid, f4 tanh, f5 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f9 reciprocal sin, f1 quan_trans sin]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Reduction and Selection**: Retains the original feature set along with key non-linear transformations and interactions, balancing complexity and dimensionality.

2. **Transformations**: Maintains essential non-linear transformations using `reciprocal`, `cube`, `square`, `sin`, and `cos` to capture potential complex relationships.

3. **Scaling**: Uses `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` for features that can benefit from scaling, improving the efficiency of model convergence.

4. **Interactions**: Incorporates interactions such as `f4 * f0 minmax_scaler` and `f4 * f0 sigmoid` to capture complex patterns between important features.

5. **Tanh and Sigmoid**: Combines `tanh` and `sigmoid` functions on strategic features to capture non-linear relationships.

This proposed feature set provides a comprehensive foundation for building a robust predictive model by effectively utilizing transformations, scalings, and interactions.

To further improve upon this feature set while considering both capturing complex interactions and maintaining interpretability, a balanced approach using additional transformations can be implemented. Here is a suggested enhanced feature set:

```

```

This set introduces additional non-linear transformations such as `log`, `reciprocal`, and `tanh`, alongside compound transformations like `sigmoid cosine`, which can help in identifying different variations or patterns in the data that might not be captured with linear transformations alone.

Explanation:
- We include key variable transformations such as reciprocal, min-max scaling, and quantile transformation to enhance numerical stability and normalization.
- Trigonometric functions, sine and cosine, are applied to help capture periodicity or nonlinear relationships.
- Operations like `cos` and `reciprocal` on quantile-transformed features help balance feature scales and can contribute to identifying underlying patterns in bounded data.
- The new feature set capitalizes on both simple and complex feature interactions while keeping the number of features manageable, which improves interpretability and may contribute positively to model performance.

2026-01-12 10:53:23,641 - INFO - llm output = To create a feature set that is potentially better than the given examples, we can enhance the transformation pipeline by combining meaningful transformations and exploring more complex interactions between features. Here's a proposed set:

```

```

Explanation:
1. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Applied to multiple original features to handle skewness and give more importance to lower values.
2. **Sigmoid & Tanh**: Provides non-linear transformation, useful for normalizing values between 0 and 1, especially for probabilistic interpretations.
3. **Quadratic & Cube**: Enhances mappings for polynomial interactions between the features.
4. **Quantile Transformation**: Helps in dealing with non-Gaussian distributions and stabilizing variance.
5. **Logarithmic Transformation**: Applied to the same features as reciprocal to address heteroscedasticity in data, further enhancing interpretability.

This feature set leverages a range of transformations and interactions to extract more informative features from the existing dataset, which can improve the prediction model's performance.

**Explanation:**
- **Standard Scaling and Min-Max Scaling**: These are suitable for numerical features to give them a standard normal distribution or scale them to a specified range, making models that depend on feature scaling perform better.
- **Sigmoid Transformations**: Sigmoid might be used on features to squash them into a (0,1) range, useful for categorical features encoded as numerical.
- **Additional Transformations**: 
  - **Square, Reciprocal, Log, Cube, Sqrt**: Added these operations to generate non-linear transformations which could capture complex relationships. For instance, squaring can emphasize large values, reciprocal can magnify small values, log can help with skewed distributions, cube for further non-linearity, and sqrt to normalize larger value ranges.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 10:53:50,472 - INFO - llm output = To provide a better feature set based on the examples given, let's look at leveraging additional transformations and combining the features more effectively. We'll continue to utilize the transformations available while focusing on improving the representational capacity and differentiability of the features for the downstream prediction task.

Consider the following:

- Include transformations on numerical or ordinal features that might have nonlinear relationships, such as logarithmic transformations, reciprocal transformations, and scaling.
- Use transformations on categorical features to increase their numerical representation through quantile transformation and scaling.

Here is a proposed feature set:
```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19,

 f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans,
 f11 quan_trans, f12 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, f15 quan_trans,
 f16 quan_trans, f17 quan_trans, f18 quan_trans, f19 quan_trans,
 f4 reciprocal, f4 sigmoid, f4 reciprocal tanh, f4 sigmoid tanh, 
f4 log, f1 reciprocal sqrt, f3 reciprocal sqrt, f4 sqrt quan_trans, f18 reciprocal log, f2 sigmoid sqrt]
```

This feature set:
- Expands the quantile transformation to all features to capture nonlinearities.
- Adds additional transformed features like logarithmic and reciprocal that can help address skewness in data.
- Includes combined feature transformations that capture different nuances in the data, such as the `sqrt` and `log`.

Here's a suggested new feature set:

```

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Retained Features:**
   - All original features are retained (`f0` to `f19`).
   - Some transformations from example 1, such as `f4 reciprocal`, `f4 sigmoid`, `f12 quan_trans`, `f12 cube`, and `f1 reciprocal`, are retained as they might add useful information.

2. **New Transformations:**
   - `f1 log`: The logarithm of the duration could help emphasize differences in shorter durations.
   - `f7 tanh`: Applying hyperbolic tangent to `installment_commitment` might help scale this feature to a bounded range and emphasize differences when commitments are high.
   - `f8 stand_scaler`: Standardizing `personal_status` could potentially normalize this feature based on its distribution across the dataset for better predictive performance.

Combining these features aims to enhance the prediction model by capturing non-linear relationships and normalizing distributions, which might improve the prediction task.

- I've kept the existing transformed features that capture different scales and interactions, such as `reciprocal`, `cube`, `sigmoid`, and `quan_trans`.
- I've added `tanh` for `f3` which may help capture additional non-linear relationships while another transformation like `log` was added to `f5` to reduce skewness and handle large values more effectively.
- Redundant transformations on the same features were minimized considering diversity in representations.

2026-01-12 10:54:03,471 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, the focus is on generating new features through transformations and combinations of original features using various mathematical functions and scaling methods. To improve the feature set further, I'll incorporate more complex transformations that reduce dimensionality or capture meaningful interactions:

New feature set:
```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f4 reciprocal, f0 * f4 reciprocal tanh, f0 quan_trans, f2 cube, f3 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f9 reciprocal, f9 log, f1 cube, f12 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, f16 sin, f16 cos, f17 stand_scaler, f18 stand_scaler, f12 tanh, f19 tanh, f4 reciprocal minmax_scaler, f4 sigmoid minmax_scaler, f1 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f12 stand_scaler, f11 sqrt, f10 square, f6 minmax_scaler, f0 * f4 square, f1 / f4 square, sqrt(f8 * f17), f0 * f6 tanh, f11 reciprocal stand_scaler]
```

In this transformation:
- Added complex interactions: combinations of multiplication and scaling functions (e.g., `f0 * f4 reciprocal tanh`, `f0 * f6 tanh`).
- Used cube transformation for `f2` as well as division and square transformations to enhance variability and representation in the dataset.
- Utilized scaling methods like `minmax_scaler` in conjunction with other transformations for better feature distribution (e.g., `f4 sigmoid minmax_scaler`).
- Included nonlinear interaction features using square root (`sqrt(f8 * f17)`).
- These combinations and transformations aim to capture deeper relationships between features for better predictive power.

- More mathematical transformations like `sqrt`, `cube`, `reciprocal`, and `log` have been applied to capture non-linear relationships.
- The interaction feature `f6 * f17` combines two existing features to possibly capture their multiplicative interaction.
- The combined feature `f10 + f2` might capture additive interactions between these numeric features.
- `tanh` transformation on `f19` is added to deal with scale variations and potential saturation effects. 

These transformations aim to leverage various mathematical properties and feature interactions to provide a more comprehensive and potentially predictive feature set.

2026-01-12 10:54:24,822 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, the goal is to improve the transformation of features such that they can potentially lead to better predictions in a downstream task. The latter example showcases a range of transformations that cover scaling, non-linear transformations (like sigmoid and tanh), and feature modifications (like sqrt and reciprocal).

For an improved feature set, the algorithm should continue to leverage a comprehensive approach that combines scaling, normalization, and non-linear transformations to capture different aspects of the data distribution and interactions. Therefore, a better set would potentially include these diverse transformations while also being mindful of computational efficiency and interpretability.

Here's a new improved feature set inspired by the latter example:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19

,f11 sqrt ,f8 tanh ,f17 log ,f4 reciprocal 
,f3 square ,f6 cube ,f9 cos ,f12 reciprocal stand_scaler]
```

In this feature set:
- Scaling continues to be applied to multiple features, ensuring that inputs remain within a standard distribution for models that assume normality.
- Non-linear transformations like sigmoid and tanh are used to re-contextualize features for boundaries and smoothness, crucial in some machine learning models.
- Power transformations, like square and cube, explore polynomial relationships which could be helpful for algorithms capable of capturing non-linear patterns like decision trees.
- Additional feature interactions are encouraged by using trigonometric functions like cos, which might capture cyclical patterns or relationships.
- A combination of transformations on a single feature (such as reciprocal followed by standard scaling) could further enhance the insight drawn from that feature by normalizing the inverted distribution.

```

### Explanation
- **Standard and Min-Max Scaling**: I preserved and added scaling transformations (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) for features like `f3` to potentially center or scale features, aiding in linear modeling approaches.
- **Sigmoid and Tanh**: These transformations can be useful, especially for squishing values within a bounded range. `f2` with `tanh` encourages a continuous gradient.
- **Logarithmic and Reciprocal**: The `log` and `reciprocal` transformations are maintained and added to new features to deal with skewness and inverse relationships (`f12 reciprocal`), which can be useful for achieving linear separability.
- **Other Transformations**: Square or sqrt enhancements (`f9 square`, `f6 sqrt`) can give polynomial modeling access or can help with variance distribution handling.

These choices are made to ensure that transformations capture additional useful specifics about features, aiding downstream tasks such as credit prediction, which likely relies on derived insights captured from the feature interactions.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

2026-01-12 10:54:34,997 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and operations, the goal is to create a new feature set that potentially improves the predictive power of the model by incorporating transformations and combinations of original features.

Looking at the features and transformations applied in the two examples, one common strategy is leveraging transformations like reciprocal, sigmoid, quantile transformation, and scaling methods such as standard scaling to enhance linear relationships and normalize the input features. Here is a proposed enhancement by combining and optimizing the transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f4 reciprocal, f4 sigmoid, f12 cube, f2 quan_trans square, f3 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f1 reciprocal tanh, f0 sigmoid, f9 reciprocal log, f1 cube, f14 quan_trans, f15 sqrt, f16 sin cos, f17 stand_scaler, f18 stand_scaler, f13 quan_trans, f19 tanh reciprocal, f4 reciprocal quan_trans, f6 minmax_scaler, f11 sqrt, f10 square]
```

**Explanation:** 
- Features that had multiple transformations applied in the examples are continued here (e.g., `f4 reciprocal`, `f4 sigmoid`) as they can encapsulate non-linear relationships. 
- The addition of combined operations like `f2 quan_trans square` and `f19 tanh reciprocal` introduces interactions that might capture more intricate patterns.
- Standard scaling and min-max scaling are maintained for normalization purposes in features `f17 stand_scaler` and `f6 minmax_scaler`.
- Sums and logarithmic transformations (`f9 reciprocal log`) can aid in interpreting multiplicative or ratio-based relationships.

Remember, the efficacy of these transformations should be validated through model performance metrics and cross-validation on relevant datasets.

1. **Diversity**: The feature set includes various types of transformations like logarithms, squares, sigmoids, cubing, reciprocals, and others, providing a broad array of dimensional perspectives.
   
2. **Feature Interactions**: Including interactions such as `f0 * f4 log` and `f12 * f13 sin` can help capture complex relationships and dependencies between features.
   
3. **Scaling**: Using `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` ensures that feature values are normalized, which is often beneficial for algorithms sensitive to the scale of data.

4. **Combining Transformations**: Some feature transformations combine operations like `f9 reciprocal log`, which can extract different attributes of original features by dimensional reduction or expansion.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 10:54:53,792 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets examples, I'll provide a new, improved feature set by using combinations of transformations that might yield better predictive power for the task of determining if a person receives a credit. The advanced transformations such as `quan_trans` (quantile transformation) and `sin` can help normalize and introduce non-linear behavior to the features.

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f4, f4 reciprocal, f0 quan_trans, f3 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 quan_trans, f11 quan_trans, f12 log, f13 sqrt, f14 quan_trans, f17 minmax_scaler, f4 reciprocal quan_trans, f1 square log, f2 cube sin, f3 sin reciprocal, f4 reciprocal quan_trans tanh, f0 quan_trans log, f1 reciprocal tanh, f2 tanh cube, f5 minmax_scaler cube, f9 quan_trans minmax_scaler, f11 reciprocal sqrt, f14 quan_trans sin, f0 sqrt, f6 minmax_scaler, f14 reciprocal, f4 reciprocal minmax_scaler, f0 quan_trans cube, f5 sqrt minmax_scaler, f6 cube sin, f9 minmax_scaler sqrt, f10 reciprocal sin, f4 reciprocal quan_trans cube, f1 reciprocal minmax_scaler, f2 quan_trans tanh minmax_scaler, f4 reciprocal tanh, f5 minmax_scaler sin, f6 cube quan_trans sin, f4 reciprocal minmax_scaler tanh, f0 cube sqrt sin, f5 tanh sin reciprocal, f2 reciprocal sin minmax_scaler]
```

In this feature set, a diverse range of transformations are applied to bring out non-linear relationships and standardize data, potentially improving model predictions. Adjustments like `cube`, `log`, `sin`, `minmax_scaler`, and `reciprocal` are employed to process features into a form that might provide more information for the credit approval decision task.
