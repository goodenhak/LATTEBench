This suggests a focus on capturing intricate relationships between the target variable and other features.

Following these examples, here is a better feature set that builds on those ideas:

```

In this feature set:
- Logarithmic transformation on `f4` (`counts_for_sons_first_occupation`) can help in bringing the distribution closer to normal, especially since it might be right-skewed.
- Various feature interactions are done using `tanh`, a transformation that maps input between -1 and 1 and can capture non-linear relationships.
- `sin` is used to introduce periodicity, which can help capture oscillatory patterns.
- Using the reciprocal function on `f0` (`fathers_occupation` as encoded feature) combined with `f4` can explore inverse relationships.
- A scaled version of `f4` is included to ensure that the effects of `f4` are consistently captured across other transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This new set applies a mix of transformations, including sigmoid, square, minmax_scaler, and stand_scaler, in various compositions to potentially enhance the prediction capability of the model. Additionally, the use of both simple and complex transformations, such as sigmoid and cube, captures both linear and nonlinear relationships.

2026-01-13 11:26:23,507 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, a better feature set should aim to capture complex relationships between features while ensuring mathematical robustness and relevance to the predictive task. From the given examples, we can infer that transformations like `cube` and combined arithmetic operations are considered advantageous, likely due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

Here's a proposed better feature set:

```
[f2 f4 - cube ,f3 f4 - cube ,f2 f4 - f3 f4 - + cube ,f0 f4 - f1 f4 - + cube ,f2 f4 - f1 f4 - + cube ,f2 f4 - f3 f4 - + cube ,f3 f4 - f1 f4 - + cube ,f3 f4 - f3 f4 - + cube sqrt ,f3 f4 - cube f2 f4 - + sqrt ,f3 f4 - cube f3 f4 - + sqrt ]
```

**Explanation:**
1. Utilized the `cube` transformation, which helps in capturing non-linear relationships.
2. Combined interactions of different features using addition, further transformed using `cube` and `sqrt`, aiming to capture more complex patterns.
3. Ensured the inclusion of a variety of interactions, potentially improving model predictive power by encompassing different scales and distributions.

The feature set provided seems to use transformations like quantile transformation, sigmoid, cube, and trigonometric functions on combinations of features `f1` and `f4`. Let's propose a new set that enhances these transformations:

[f4 quan_trans ,f1 f4 sigmoid - ,f1 f4 quan_trans - ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin sigmoid ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin cube ,f4 sigmoid sigmoid cube ,f4 sigmoid cube sigmoid cube ,f4 quan_trans sigmoid cube ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin sigmoid cube ,f1 f4 sigmoid - cube ,f1 f4 quan_trans - cube ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin sinh ,f4 sigmoid tanh sigmoid cube]

Here, I've added:
- `f1 f4 sigmoid - sin sinh`: which adds an additional hyperbolic sine transformation for potential non-linear relationships.
- `f4 sigmoid tanh sigmoid cube`: which introduces a hyperbolic tangent after a sigmoid and before cubing, aiming to capture more complex patterns in the data.

These transformations might help uncover hidden interactions between features that could improve prediction power, especially given the complexity of classifying social mobility based on the given variables.

The goal is to utilize a mix of transformations that provide useful insights and potentially enhance model predictions. Here's how I would construct a new feature set:

- Start by integrating the sine transformations of `f0` and `f4` for capturing periodic patterns.
- Use cosine transformations of `f1` to explore complementary periodicity.
- Square transformations can highlight non-linear relationships, and I will include cube transformations to emphasize this further.
- Incorporate `quan_trans` and `stand_scaler` to handle different scales and distributions among the features.
- Utilize both min-max and standardized scalers to assist in handling skewness and dispersal effectively.

2026-01-13 11:27:24,708 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, the goal is to construct a better feature transformation that combines the strengths of the examples. Let's carefully examine how each transformation manipulates and scales the features. The aim is to capture important variations while potentially introducing normalization and non-linear transformations like the hyperbolic tangent, quantile transformation, or scaling.

Here's the improved feature set based on the provided examples:

```plaintext

```

### Key Changes Made:
- Introduced the `square` transformation in one of the representations aiming to capture non-linear relationships while maintaining normalization with `minmax_scaler`.
- Combined transformations `square` and `quan_trans` to leverage the potential of capturing distribution skewness and multi-modal data behavior.
- Avoid repeated sequences to improve the feature set by bringing variations that can capture a different spectrum of data behavior and transformations.

This new set aims to provide a good balance of scaling, normalization, and non-linear transformations to potentially yield better feature sets for prediction modeling purposes.

3. The feature `f1 square` is included to capture non-linear relationships.
4. Quantile transformation (`f1 square quan_trans`) and standard scaling (`f1 square stand_scaler`) of `f1 square` are maintained as these can help in normalizing the feature distribution.
5. A new interaction term `f2 f3 * log` is added, which first multiplies `f2` and `f3` and then applies the logarithm. Interaction terms can capture combined effects of features on the target variable.
6. Kept `f1 square f1 square -` and `f1 square cos` as they can further enhance the variability and complexity of the feature transformations.

1. **Consider non-linear transformations and scaling combined**:
   - Take advantage of combining trigonometric and scaling transformations to capture different non-linear patterns.

Here’s the new feature set:

[f4 tanh ,f4 f0 - minmax_scaler, f4 f4 - f1 * f3 + sqrt quan_trans]

Explanation:
- **f4 tanh**: Applying the hyperbolic tangent transformation to the feature f4, which helps in compressing values and emphasizes ambivalent features.
- **f4 f0 - minmax_scaler**: This transformation ensures the difference between f4 and f0 is scaled to a range [0, 1], enhancing linear separability.
- **f4 f4 - f1 * f3 + sqrt quan_trans**: Combines multiple operations to introduce complex interactions and distributions in the features. This expression includes:
  - Squaring the difference f4-f4 before adding the product of f1 and f3.
  - The `sqrt` and `quan_trans` (quantile transformation) help in normalizing and capturing higher-order relations in the data.

This new feature set should provide a more comprehensive interaction among the existing features, potentially improving predictive performance.

Explanation:
1. Retained `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` unchanged to maintain the categorical nature.
2. Used `sin` transformation on `f0`, `f2`, and `f3`, as involving such transformations could capture cyclic patterns and interactions between occupations and family structures effectively.
3. Used `cos` on `f4` as a variation of cyclic transformation.
4. Applied `square` transformation on `f0` to amplify the differences.
5. Used `cube` transformation on `f1` that can capture non-linear relationships more effectively than `square`.
6. Applied `tanh` on `f2` to squash values into the range `[-1,1]`, which can be helpful for models sensitive to scale.
7. Applied `minmax_scaler` on `f3` to ensure it falls between 0 and 1, which is beneficial in normalizing feature scales.
8. Used `log` transformation on `f4` to normalize positive skew by compressing large numbers.
9. Retained `stand_scaler` transformation on `f0` to standardize the data.
10. Added `sqrt` transformation on `f4` for further normalizing its range while maintaining numerical stability.
11. Added `reciprocal` transformation on `f0` to introduce non-linear, inverse relationships that could be potentially predictive.

This feature set aims to capture a mixture of base transformations and complex relationships, improving the downstream task's predictive accuracy.

Below is a transformed feature set example:

 f4 f2 - f4 f2 - f4 f3 - f4 f1 - f4 f1 - minmax_scaler - - - minmax_scaler - quan_trans stand_scaler, 
 f4 f2 - f4 f4 tanh - f4 f3 - f4 f1 - f4 f1 - minmax_scaler - - - minmax_scaler - quan_trans stand_scaler, 
 f4 f2 - f4 f4 f4 - - f4 f3 - f4 f1 - f4 f1 - minmax_scaler - - - minmax_scaler - quan_trans stand_scaler, 
 f4 f4 f4 - - f4 f4 tanh - f4 f2 - f4 f1 - f4 f1 - minmax_scaler - - - minmax_scaler - quan_trans stand_scaler]
```

In this feature set:
- A `stand_scaler` has been added, which standardizes the variable to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 after other transformations, potentially making features more robust to outliers and improving model performance.
- The transformations explore different derivations and scalings of the counts (f4), which is the critical feature to capturing meaningful predictions.

- I included `f0 sqrt` (from the first example) to incorporate non-linear transformations which may reveal new insights, particularly for the continuous `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
- Kept `f1 square`, `f2 square`, and `f3 square` (from the second example) to capture the non-linear relationships between features related to the father's and son's occupations and family structure.
- Preserved `f4 log` and `f4 reciprocal` (from the first example) for numerical stability and to address any skewness in distribution of `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
- Added `f0 f1 +`, `f0 f2 +`, and `f0 f3 +` (new additions) to explore the cumulative effects of combining the father's occupation with family structure, race, and son's occupation.

[f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f0 tanh ,f0 sin ,f2 cos ,f3 sin ,f4 cos ,f1 square tanh ,f0 square stand_scaler ,f1 cube minmax_scaler ,f2 log ,f3 reciprocal ,f4 stand_scaler ,f0 square f1 square + quan_trans ,f1 square f0 square cos *]
```

Explanation:
- `f0 tanh` and `f0 sin`: Applies non-linear transformation to the first feature for possible complex pattern capture.
- `f1 cube minmax_scaler`: Cubes the feature and scales using min-max, emphasizing both magnitude and distribution.
- `f3 reciprocal`: Inverses the third feature for potential importance.
- `f1 square tanh`: Combination of squaring and applying tanh for more complex non-linear transformation.
- `f0 square f1 square + quan_trans`: Summing squares of features, followed by quantile transformation, which handles outliers and normalizes.
- `f1 square f0 square cos *`: Combines features by squaring and using cosine function, capturing intricate relationships.

2. **cube**: Captures extreme values for counts to catch potentially meaningful outliers.
3. **sqrt multiplication**: Adding f0 sqrt enhances the representation of non-linear relationships when multiplied by f4.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The latter example (second) is considered better than the first due to more transformations applied and operations combined.

Here's a proposed enhancement feature set derived from the previous examples:

```

```

Explanation:
- The feature set keeps effective transformations like `cos`, `sin`, `square`, `log`, and combines them with arithmetic operations.
- Introduces complex interactions, such as `f4 log f4 sqrt *`, allowing for potentially higher-order feature extraction.
- Maintains scaling operations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to ensure features are comparable.
- Uses multiplicative interactions between transformed features, exemplified by `f1 square f1 square cos *`, which can uncover nonlinear relationships that are often beneficial in classification tasks.

2026-01-13 11:29:20,107 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, the latter is described as better because it uses the tanh function instead of just multiplying by sin. The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function is known for its useful properties in mapping input values to an output range between -1 and 1, which can often help in stabilizing training processes and improving model performance due to its non-linear transformation capabilities.

By analyzing these two, we can create a new feature set that incorporates the tanh transformation where applicable, to possibly enhance the feature set further. Here is the improved feature set:

```
[f4 quan_trans ,f1 f4 sigmoid - ,f1 f4 quan_trans - ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin sigmoid ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin tanh ,f4 quan_trans sigmoid cube ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin sigmoid cube ,f1 f4 sigmoid - tanh ,f1 f4 quan_trans - tanh ,f1 f4 sigmoid - f1 f4 sigmoid - sin tanh * ,f1 f4 quan_trans - f1 f4 sigmoid - sin tanh * ,f1 f4 sigmoid - sin tanh f1 f4 quan_trans - sigmoid *]
```

In this improved feature set, I've replaced the 'cube' operations with 'tanh' in relevant transformations to leverage the benefits of the tanh function as indicated by your preference for the second example. This new set aims to provide a more refined set of features potentially more advantageous for the downstream predictive task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:29:45,113 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples and understanding of feature engineering operations, I will provide a new feature set that attempts to improve upon the previous ones. The objective is to provide transformations that can potentially enhance the predictive performance of the model.

Here's the new feature set proposed:

- Feature 1: `[f4 f2 - f4 f4 tanh - f4 f3 - f4 f1 - f4 f1 - minmax_scaler - - - minmax_scaler - quan_trans]`
- Feature 2: `[f4 f4 f4 - - f4 f4 tanh - f4 f2 - f4 f1 - f4 f1 - minmax_scaler - - - minmax_scaler - square]`
- Feature 3: `[f4 f2 - f4 f4 f4 - - f4 f3 - f4 f1 - f4 f1 - minmax_scaler - - - minmax_scaler - quan_trans]`
- Feature 4: `[f4 f4 tanh - f4 f2 f2 * - f4 f1 - f4 f1 - minmax_scaler - - - minmax_scaler - reciprocal]`
- Feature 5: `[f4 f2 - f4 f4 f4 tanh - - f4 f3 - f4 f3 - minmax_scaler cube - - - minmax_scaler - square]`

These features aim to utilize a combination of transformations (like `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`, `square`, and `reciprocal`) to capture non-linear relationships and improve scaling. Using such diverse transformations can help in better capturing the intrinsic patterns in the data, which is crucial for effective prediction of son's current occupation categories.
