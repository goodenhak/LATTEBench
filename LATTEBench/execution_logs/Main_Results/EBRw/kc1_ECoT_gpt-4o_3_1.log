Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f11 cos ,f9 sigmoid]

2026-01-12 11:46:01,257 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the given examples, we'll consider data transformations that could enhance the predictive power of the model. Here's a new feature set combining and building upon the transformations from both examples:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 sqrt ,f5 tanh ,f9 quan_trans ,f4 square ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f9 cos ,f5 cube ,f11 cos ,f9 sigmoid ,f5 log ,f17 reciprocal]
```

In this new feature set, I decided to include:
- Transformations such as `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `cos` to capture non-linear relationships.
- Scalers like `minmax_scaler` for normalization to compare features on a similar scale.
- Adding `log` and `reciprocal` transformations for `f5` and `f17` respectively to explore different types of non-linear relationships.
- Retained `sigmoid`, `square`, `cube`, and `quan_trans` transformations for their distinctiveness in capturing different aspects of the feature distributions.
  
This set aims to provide a richer feature space that captures both linear and non-linear relationships, potentially contributing to better predictive performance in downstream tasks.

Here's a feature set combining useful elements from both examples and introducing slight variations to further explore complex interactions:

In this updated feature set:
- Cubing transformations are retained from the second example as they allow experimenting with polynomial feature spaces which might help capturing complexities in data.
- Trigonometric functions (sin and cos) and logarithmic transformations are introduced to explore non-linear relationships and provide a non-linear scaling of data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:46:10,914 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we can employ operations that are likely to increase the discriminatory power of our model for defect prediction. The examples include quantile transformation, scaling, trigonometric, and exponential transformations. While both transformations can be beneficial, the second example heavily relies on square root transformations which could be beneficial to handle skewed distributions but might not necessarily capture the non-linear relationships effectively as the first example potentially could with quantile transformations.

Therefore, we will attempt to combine ideas from both, with an emphasis on transforming features to increase their relevance for classification:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f5 sqrt, f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f12 sqrt, f14 sqrt, f16 sqrt, f17 sqrt, f18 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f5 tanh, f11 sin tanh, f9 cos, f8 recipocal, f9 sigmoid, f4 reciprocal, f6 minmax_scaler, f5 cube, f12 cube]
```

Here is the reasoning:
- Root transformations (sqrt) are applied to several features, a strategy often used to reduce skewness and stabilize variance.
- Tanh is used here as it can enhance the range and sensitivity for particular inputs, and combined with sin can capture more complex patterns.
- Reciprocal and cube offer unique nonlinear transformations to potentially highlight relationships missed by simpler transformations.
- Minmax scaling retains relative feature importance while normalizing the scales.
- Sigmoid can help interpret probabilities which might be useful for binary classification tasks.

```

### Explanation of Additions:

1. **f18 f0 log ***: This operation multiplies the logarithm of `f0` with `f18`, potentially capturing multiplicative scaling in the data.

2. **f17 f6 reciprocal /**: Using the reciprocal of `f6`, this operation divides `f17` by the reciprocal, potentially normalizing large swings in data.

3. **f9 f16 minmax_scaler +**: Adding features after scaling `f9` with min-max scaler can highlight relative variations between features captured during scaling.

4. **f11 f14 tanh +**: Applying hyperbolic functions such as tanh can automatically smooth outliers and lead to more stable features, with the addition providing combined value assessments. 

These manipulations aim to enrich the feature space, casting a wider net for identifying potential relationships between input features and the target variable (software defects).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:46:22,523 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, I will create a new enhanced feature set by combining elements from both examples, prioritizing feature diversity, application of suitable transformations, and the avoidance of repetitive operations for more effective feature engineering:

- Start by including a variety of original features to maintain a comprehensive baseline.
- Apply transformations such as sin, sigmoid, and other diverse nonlinear transformations to potentially capture complex relationships present in the dataset.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```python
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 sin]

,f0 sqrt ,f1 square ,f18 log ,f14 tanh ,f18 cube ,f20 reciprocal ,f17 stand_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f9 quan_trans ,f13 sigmoid]
```

In this feature set:

- The inclusion of original features (`f0` to `f20`) ensures coverage of raw data context.
- The application of sine (`sin`) transformation to multiple features may capture oscillatory patterns relevant to software defects.
- Nonlinear transformations (`sqrt`, `square`, `log`, `tanh`, `cube`, `reciprocal`) are applied to certain features to model complex relationships and interactions.
- Scaling transformations (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`) can facilitate the handling of varying feature ranges and distributions, potentially enhancing model performance.
- Sigmoid function ensures the conversion of feature values into a bounded range, which is often useful in models where normalized inputs are necessary.

This balanced and diverse approach aims to maximize the potential of feature transformations, thus aiding in more accurate defect predictions.

2026-01-12 11:46:28,974 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, the objective is to create a more effective feature set. The examples demonstrate transformations using operations such as arithmetic manipulations and various scaler and nonlinear transformations. Keeping in mind the potential for overfitting with overly complex feature combinations, I'll aim to simplify and optimize transformations while leveraging essential higher-order features:

```plaintext

```

This feature set includes a combination of:

- Complex interactions (`f0`, `f19`, `f6`, `cube`, `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`) to capture nonlinear relationships and potential multicollinearity effects.
- Logarithmic (`log`) and scaled transformations (`stand_scaler`) to adjust ranges and help stabilize variance, thus making models more robust to noise.
- Smooth transformations (`sigmoid`, `tanh`) to assist in delineating boundaries for classification tasks.
- Application of domain-expert recommended functions like quantitative transformation (`quan_trans`) to leverage statistical distribution adjustments. 

These transformed features should enhance model performance by improving generalization metrics, mitigating overfitting, and offering better predictions for software defect presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This approach aims to uncover complex non-linear relationships that could be indicative of defects.

```

Key transformations include:
- **Reciprocal and Stand Scaler**: Applied on features potentially capturing the inverse relationships and normalization.
- **Log Transformation**: Used on loc and other numerical-heavy metrics for scaling of skewed distributions.
- **Sigmoid and Sin**: Applied for capturing non-linear transformations.
- **Multiple Sine Transformations**: Explore deeper sinusoidal relationships which could expose periodic variations in defect occurrences.
- **Cosine Transformations**: Offers complementary periodic capture through cosine function.

These transformations aim to discern latent patterns and complex interactions between code characteristics, enhancing predictive capacity for software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:46:52,558 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set for the task of software defect prediction, we should aim to enhance the representation power of the features while keeping computational efficiency in mind. The recent examples show some transformations such as square and square roots applied multiple times to certain features. Let's leverage a combination of these transformations and introduce additional operations like scaling and non-linear transformations.

Here's a new feature set that might better capture the characteristics associated with software defects:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 sqrt ,f9 log ,f11 square ,f19 tanh ,f10 cube ,f15 reciprocal ,f4 quant_trans ,f6 square sqrt ,f5 sin ,f18 cos ,f7 sigmoid]
```

Explanation of the transformations:
- **Scaling** (Min-Max, Standard Scaler): Helps in normalizing the values of features to a common scale, improving convergence for certain models and capturing variance in smaller features.
- **Logarithmic and Square root transformations**: Reduce skewness and stabilize variance, especially for features with large ranges.
- **Square and Cube transformations**: Introduce non-linearity which could help models capture complex relationships.
- **Trigonometric and Hyperbolic functions (sin, cos, tanh)**: Add non-linearity and periodic patterns; sometimes useful for capturing cyclical variance.
- **Quantile transformation**: Makes feature distribution uniform without strong assumptions, can improve model performance in certain cases.

These transformations aim to enhance the diversity and representation of the features for the defect prediction model.

Explanation:
- Nonlinear transformations (square, square root, tanh, log, cube) explore complex relationships.
- Interaction terms (e.g., f4 + f5, f6 * f7, f2 / f3) potentially capture dependencies between features that influence the defect outcome.
- Scaling transformations (minmax_scaler, stand_scaler) normalize features, which can improve model performance.
- Choices for transformations are informed by both provided examples and common practices for enhancing predictor variables in models.

```

### Explanation

1. **Feature Transformations**:
   - Using `tanh` on `f11` (Halstead effort) captures how changes in cognitive load might smooth outcomes.
   - Applying transformations like `sigmoid`, `square`, and `cos` to `f9` (Halstead time estimator) to explore impact on defect prediction.
   - Operations like `reciprocal`, `stand_scaler`, and `log` allow normalization and handling of non-linear relationships and high variance features. These transformations are applied across multiple important features.

2. **Scalers**:
   - `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` allow standardizing and rescaling values which is beneficial for many algorithms, ensuring all features contribute meaningfully.

Overall, combining feature transformations with scaling ensures that the algorithm is better equipped to capture relationships between features and the target variable.

2026-01-12 11:47:22,377 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, the latter transformation offers an improvement by including a standardized version of feature `f9` (`f9 stand_scaler`), which can help in ensuring that features are on similar scales and thus potentially improve the prediction model's performance. An additional improvement could involve transforming other features to further refine the feature set and enhance prediction accuracy.

Here's a suggested transformation:

Explanation:
- `f9 stand_scaler`: Standardizing `f9` ensures that it is on the same scale across the dataset, which is useful for models sensitive to feature scaling.
- `f11 cube`: Keeping the cube transformation for `f11` could be helpful if its distribution benefits from nonlinear transformation.
- `f5 sin`: Applying the sine function to `f5` could capture periodic behavior or smooth variations in the data.
- `f4 log`: Applying a logarithmic transformation to `f4` can manage skewness and compress the scale for large values.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2026-01-12 11:47:28,719 - INFO - llm output = In the task of software defect prediction using feature engineering with transformed features expressed in postfix notation, the focus is on generating new features that could potentially improve prediction accuracy. 

Based on the examples provided, we can observe the extensive use of the sine function in transforming features, which suggests that non-linear transformations might be beneficial for this task. Both examples involve combinations of original features (such as f0, f1, f5, etc.) and a series of transformations involving the sine function applied multiple times. The second example further integrates operations like minmax scaling and quantile transformation.

In order to synthesize a better feature set, let's carefully combine diverse transformations that balance complexity with potential predictive power:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f10 ,f12 ,f14 ,f18 ,f20 ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 quan_trans ,f10 sin ,f18 sin ,f20 sin ,f0 sin sin ,f7 sin sin ,f10 sin sin ,f6 sin sin sin ,f10 sin sin sin ,f1 sin sin ,f5 sin sin sin ,f0 sin sin sin sin sin ,f10 sin sin sin sin ,f20 sin sin sin sin ,f0 minmax_scaler sin ,f5 stand_scaler sin ,f6 quan_trans sin ,f7 sin sin sin ,f0 sin sin sin sin ,f1 sin sin sin ,f14 sin sin sin ,f17 sin sin ,f6 cube ,f10 log ,f18 cube ]
```

**Explanation**:

1. Keep a mix of essential features (e.g., f0, f1, f5, etc.) to preserve the baseline information.
2. Apply `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans` to various features to normalize or transform distributions; this can help manage different scales and ranges.
3. Use `sin` extensively for non-linear transformations, allowing for complex patterns to be captured, but do not overuse it on a single feature as it may lead to diminishing returns.
4. Introduce `cube` and `log` transformations as alternatives for some features (f6, f10, f18). These can capture different aspects of the distribution or underlying patterns not captured by sine alone.
5. Ensure a diverse set of transformations is applied across different features, maintaining breadth and depth without excessive redundancy.

This approach integrates a variety of transformations to maximize captured variability and potential predictive power while managing computational complexity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This improved feature set includes:

- `f3 tanh`: Tanh can handle both negative and positive inputs, potentially providing a smooth gradient transformation that is especially useful for cyclic complexity measures.
- `f8 log`: Applying a logarithm transformation can help to handle skewness and bring values into a more interpretable range, especially relevant for intelligence measures which may not be linear.
- `f12 reciprocal`: The reciprocal transformation can be useful for measures that increase exponentially, giving more sensitivity to lower values.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

This feature set retains all original features and combines several transformations:
- Using `f9 log` adds a non-linear transformation that can highlight multiplicative relationships or manage large values.
- `f9 sqrt` further explores f9 with root transformation for smoothing.
- Applying `f11 cos` and `f5 tanh` introduces non-linear cyclic and saturation transformations which can capture variations in these features.
- Including `f9 quan_trans` adds quantile transformation for improved normalization. 

This transformed feature set should offer improved discriminative power for prediction tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:48:02,474 - INFO - llm output = To build a better feature set using the given examples, we can combine the transformations in a meaningful way to capture more complex relationships within the data. Here's a new feature set considering both standard scaling and non-linear transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

 f4 sqrt stand_scaler, f8 tanh quant_trans]
```

In this feature set:
- We retain the original features for completeness.
- We include both transformations from the previous examples (e.g., `f9 sqrt`, `f9 quan_trans`, `f11 tanh` for non-linear transformations), as these capture non-linearity which can be informative.
- We perform standard scaling on selected features to normalize them for better performance in learning algorithms.
- We add some additional non-linear transformations that did not appear in the examples (`f5 log`, `f7 reciprocal`, `f3 cube`) to explore different aspects of the data.
- We combine scaling with some non-linear transformations (e.g., `f4 sqrt stand_scaler`, `f8 tanh quant_trans`) to ensure different scales and distributions are effectively managed.

This approach aims to capture complexity while ensuring the features remain interpretable and useful for prediction.

Additions and Modifications:
- **`f1 log`**: Taking the logarithm of cyclomatic complexity may enhance features related to the complexity of the code, highlighting non-linear relationships.
- **`f3 reciprocal`**: Using the reciprocal of design complexity to potentially model relationships where lower complexity has higher relevance.
- **`f5 sigmoid`**: Combining Halstead volume with a sigmoid transformation to squeeze values into a bounded range, which might help in capturing non-linear effects with bounded emphasis. 

These additions aim to better capture non-linear relationships and interactions that might be relevant for predicting software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:48:10,611 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, it is apparent that the use of the sine transformation is heavily favored, with nested sine operations. To improve upon this approach while maintaining the format, it is beneficial to explore combinations of different transformations alongside sine operations, which can introduce non-linear complexities useful for defect prediction.

Here's a better feature set leveraging combinations of operations:

[f0 ,f1 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f10 ,f11 ,f14 ,f18 ,f6 sin ,f7 sin ,f10 sin ,f17 sin ,f20 sin ,f0 sin sin ,f1 log ,f3 tanh ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sin tanh ,f6 cos sin ,f7 sin sin sin ,f10 sin sin sin ,f12 sin ,f8 reciprocal ,f12 square ,f13 tanh sin ,f0 square sin ,f6 log ,f14 reciprocal sin ,f10 sin sin sin sin ,f20 tanh ,f19 cube ,f1 sin sin sin ,f18 log ,f12 sin sin sin sin ,f17 sqrt ,f16 sin cube ,f11 reciprocal sin ,f3 log ,f9 sin sin ,f15 sin ,f20 cos]

This set combines sine transformations with log, tanh, square, reciprocal, cos, and cube operations to create a variety of complex features derived from the original data, potentially enhancing predictive performance by capturing more nuanced patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:48:20,107 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, it seems that feature engineering can benefit from both transformations using mathematical functions and scaling methods. The latter example showcases extensive use of standard scaling, which is often beneficial for models sensitive to feature scales, such as linear models or neural networks. The second example also applies `tanh` to an existing feature before scaling. 

To create a better feature set, I will combine transformations that can help linearly separate data or enhance model performance:

- Mix foundational transformations with nonlinear ones to potentially capture complex relationships.
- Use scaling judiciously to improve model convergence and response.
  
Here is an improved new feature set based on the given examples:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f11 tanh, f9 sigmoid, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f7 tanh, f8 cube, f5 reciprocal, f10 minmax_scaler, f13 minmax_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f15 tanh, f16 square, f17 cube, f11 log, f12 reciprocal stand_scaler, f9 sin stand_scaler]

This feature set combines different transformations including `sin`, `cube`, `tanh`, and scaling methods such as `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`, aiming to improve the feature representation while accommodating the complexity of the relationships between features and the target variable.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 sqrt ,f9 quan_trans ,f5 tanh ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f4 square ,f9 cos ,f5 cube ,f4 tanh ,f11 tanh]

2026-01-12 11:48:31,331 - INFO - llm output = Sure, based on the given feature set examples, I will provide a new and potentially better feature set using the available transformations. The new feature set should aim to capture useful information with transformations that are generally effective for data preprocessing in predictive modeling.

Given Feature Set Examples:
1. `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 sqrt, f9 quan_trans, f5 tanh, f11 minmax_scaler, f4 square, f9 cos, f5 cube, f4 tanh, f11 tanh]`
2. `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f11 cos, f9 sigmoid, f9 square, f5 cos, f9 cos, f4 cos]`

New, Improved Feature Set:
```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f4 log, f5 tanh, f9 sigmoid, f11 minmax_scaler, f4 square, f5 cube, f9 reciprocal, f11 stand_scaler, f3 sqrt]
```

Explanation:
- `f4 log`: Log transformation applied to `f4` can help stabilize variance and make data more normally distributed.
- `f5 tanh`: Tanh is effective for squashing values to a range between -1 and 1, useful for normalization.
- `f9 sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation applied to `f9` provides non-linearity and ensures values are between 0 and 1, similar to probability estimation.
- `f11 minmax_scaler`: A transformation that scales `f11` to a range between 0 and 1, making it suitable for algorithms that require normalized inputs.
- `f4 square`: Squaring `f4` might help highlight non-linear relationships.
- `f5 cube`: Cubing `f5` can enhance feature importance by accentuating large values.
- `f9 reciprocal`: Takes the reciprocal of `f9`, potentially providing insight into inverse relationships in the data.
- `f11 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling applied to `f11`, centering the data around zero and scaling it to unit variance.
- `f3 sqrt`: Square root applied to `f3` reduces the range of the data, potentially highlighting subtle patterns.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:48:44,245 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided examples of new feature sets, we can generate another improved feature set by considering useful transformations that can potentially enhance predictive capability. Here's a new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 square ,f9 sigmoid ,f11 cos ,f5 tanh ,f4 log]
```

In this improved feature set:
- `f9 square` retains the feature from Example 2 that might capture non-linear relationships in a more expressive manner.
- `f9 sigmoid` is also retained from Example 2 to leverage the normalization-like effect of sigmoid in terms of scaling values between 0 and 1.
- `f11 cos` is kept from Example 2, as the cosine function can introduce periodicity or interactions between features that may be meaningful.
- `f5 tanh` helps manage any extreme values and can introduce smooth non-linear relationships.
- `f4 log` introduces a log transformation that can be particularly useful for features with a wide range or skewed distributions, offering better scaling and interpretability.

This set expands the transformations with carefully chosen combinations to enrich the feature representation and potentially improve model performance with non-linear and normalized transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a new feature set construction:

```

```

This set includes:

1. Standard scaling of relevant features to normalize their distributions for better model performance.
2. Non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `sin`, `sqrt`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` to capture complex patterns.
3. Utilizing `log` transformation for features potentially spanning several orders of magnitude, helping to reduce skewness.
4. `minmax_scaler` for feature normalization when the range is critical.
5. Chaining transformations (like `f11 tanh stand_scaler` and `f11 tanh sigmoid`) to enhance model learning with complex interactions. 

This set aims to balance between normalizing feature scales and introducing non-linear complexities to improve defect prediction models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Explanation:
- The new feature set includes transformations like `cube`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `log`, and `sigmoid`, which can enhance the richness of the dataset's features for modeling.
- The reciprocal and cube transformations applied to `f1` introduce non-linear characteristics that might correlate with defect presence, given the nature of the software metrics.
- `f19 sigmoid` can help in normalizing the branch count metric, potentially highlighting critical thresholds that relate to defect rates.
- The original features `f0, f1, ..., f20` are preserved for their potential raw predictive power.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Retained Features**: Most of the original features (`f0` to `f20`) are retained for contextual completeness.
2. **Combined Transformations**:
   - **Overlap**: Combined the `cos` and `sigmoid` applications on `f9`.
   - **New Transformations**:
     - Added `f9 reciprocal` for potential proportional effects.
     - Added `f6 log` to potentially linearize exponential relationships.
     - Combined `f4 f7 /` to examine the ratio between features `f4` and `f7`.
     - Added `f10 f19 *` to explore interactions between `f10` and `f19`.
     - Added `f3 f5 -` to explore differences between `f3` and `f5`.

These new combinations aim to capture more complex interactions and potentially informative transformations to help improve defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:49:22,248 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided and the task of improving predictions, the latter example uses standardized scaling extensively which can be useful for maintaining uniformity and improving performance in models sensitive to feature scales, such as those involving gradient descent. Additionally, applying `tanh` followed by `stand_scaler` to `f11` suggests a consideration of non-linear transformations and further scaling for improved model predictions. Considering these practices, here is a refined feature set incorporating similar transformations:

```plaintext

In this new feature set:
- The use of `stand_scaler` after various transformation functions (`minmax_scaler`, `square`, `tanh`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `sigmoid`, `cos`) should help in stabilizing the ranges of transformed features and enhance prediction accuracy.
- A variety of transformation functions are applied in post-processing to capture potential non-linear relationships, providing a richer feature space for model training.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Features**: We retain a subset of original features to ensure that essential raw data is preserved.
2. **Sine Transformation**: Apply multiple depths of sine transformations for non-linear characteristic capture from various features.
3. **Sigmoid**: Use sigmoid on `f8` to get a bounded transformation, adapting it to the broader scale.
4. **MinMax Scaler and Quantile Transformation**: Apply scaling and quantile transformations to `f9` to capture distribution changes.
5. **Complex Transformations**: Utilize cube, reciprocal, sqrt, and logarithmic transformations to introduce non-linearity and capture variation across different features.
6. **Stand Scaler**: Standard scaling is used to iterate over features to negate the effects of different ranges.

These transformations should help in capturing complex relationships and interactions in the dataset, potentially improving prediction performance in the downstream task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:49:36,715 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, it's evident that new feature transformations can potentially enhance the predictive power for software defect prediction by capturing nonlinear relationships, scaling effects, or incorporating domain-specific knowledge through mathematical operations. To create a better feature set, consider combining effective transformations from both examples while aligning them for predictive significance. Here's the improved feature set:

This feature set includes:
- Use of minmax scaler on f9 for maintaining scale consistency.
- Use of cosine on f11 and f5 to capture periodic behavior or domain-specific scaling.
- Reciprocal transformations on f9 and f12 to investigate inverse relationships.
- Log transformations on f4 and f8 to handle skewed distributions and highlight multiplicative relationships.
- Tanh transformation on f3 for smooth saturation effects, useful in capturing interactions between cyclomatic complexity and defect presence.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f11 tanh ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f13 stand_scaler ,f14 stand_scaler ,f15 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f17 stand_scaler ,f18 stand_scaler ,f19 stand_scaler ,f20 stand_scaler ,f11 tanh stand_scaler , f11 tanh sigmoid, f6 sqrt, f0 cube, f7 reciprocal, f4 log, f14 minmax_scaler, f8 sin]

2026-01-12 11:49:41,918 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, it seems the second example uses a larger number of transformations (like stand_scaler and tanh) compared to unique transformations like sigmoid, sqrt, cube, reciprocal, log, minmax_scaler, and sin in the first example. The diversity of transformations in the first example can potentially offer more complex nonlinear relationships, which might be beneficial in defect prediction.

Here’s an improved feature set combining elements from both examples for potentially better predictive performance:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f13 stand_scaler ,f14 stand_scaler ,f15 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f17 stand_scaler ,f18 stand_scaler ,f19 stand_scaler ,f20 stand_scaler ,f11 tanh ,f11 tanh stand_scaler ,f11 tanh sigmoid, f6 sqrt, f0 cube, f7 reciprocal, f4 log, f14 minmax_scaler, f8 sin, f5 cos]
```

Key Changes:
- Include diverse transformations like `sqrt`, `cube`, `reciprocal`, `log`, `minmax_scaler`, and `sin`, which are present in the first example.
- Add `cos` for additional nonlinear transformation.
- Retain transformations like `stand_scaler` and `tanh` which are consistently applied across features, ensuring normalization and potential non-linear benefits.

### Explanation:
- I've kept operational transformations that capture essential non-linear relationships for the selected features, like `sqrt`, `square`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid`.
- Utilizing `log` transformation for f1 can help in stabilizing variance while addressing skewness, which is often useful in enhancing linear models.
- I introduced `stand_scaler` for f7 to improve feature scaling uniformity, which can be beneficial for models sensitive to feature distribution.
- Added `tanh` transformation to f8, as it'll help in controlling the effect of outliers by compressing the ranges and maximizing sensitivity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f10 ,f11 ,f14 ,f18 ,f6 sin ,f7 sin ,f10 sin ,f17 sin ,f20 sin ,f0 sin sin ,f7 sin sin ,f10 sin sin ,f6 sin sin sin ,f10 sin sin sin ,f12 sin ,f0 sin sin sin sin ,f10 sin sin sin sin ,f12 sin sin sin sin ,f14 sin sin sin sin ,f17 sin sin sin sin ,f8 sin sin sin ,f9 sin sin sin ,f10 sin sin sin sin sin ,f6 sin sin sin sin ,f0 sin sin sin ,f1 sin sin ,f14 sin ,f0 sin sin sin sin sin sin ,f10 sin sin sin sin sin sin ,f14 sin sin sin sin sin sin ,f8 sin sin sin sin sin ,f9 sin sin sin sin sin ,f1 sin sin sin ,f12 sin sin sin ,f14 sin sin ,f17 sin sin ,f20 sin sin ,f1 sin]

2026-01-12 11:49:52,257 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, we can identify several transformations and operations that are being applied to the original features. The examples indicate a potential benefit from applying trigonometric transformations, scaling techniques, and quantization. To improve upon the previous examples while maintaining the given format, I would suggest a feature set that incorporates a balanced mixture of these transformations.

Here's an optimized feature set leveraging the insights from both examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f5 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f0 square ,f9 quan_trans ,f10 sqrt ,f0 sin ,f6 sin ,f7 sin ,f10 sin ,f12 sin ,f16 sin ,f17 sin ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f9 sin sin ,f10 sin sin ,f7 sin sin ,f0 reciprocal ,f9 reciprocal ,f6 sin sin ,f11 sin sin ,f17 sin sin ,f14 sin sin ,f0 sin sin ,f9 sin ,f10 sin sin sin ,f11 sin sin sin ,f16 sin sin sin ,f20 sin sin sin ,f0 sin sin sin ,f14 sin cube]
```

**Key Additions and Changes:**

1. **Scaling and Quantization:** Use `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` on selected features to standardize the data.
2. **Trigonometric Transformations:** Increased emphasis on `sin`, which seems prevalent in promoting nonlinear relationships.
3. **Squared and Square Root Transformations:** Applied to one primary feature for emphasizing power form relationships.
4. **Reciprocal Transformation:** Aimed at capturing inverse relationships within key features.
5. **Cube Transformation:** Added to one feature to reflect possible interactions or higher order non-linear effects.

This balanced approach captures the complexity of interactions while improving feature distributions.
