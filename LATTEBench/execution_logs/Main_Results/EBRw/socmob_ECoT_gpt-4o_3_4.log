2026-01-13 11:35:45,711 - INFO - llm output = To generate a more informative feature set based on the given postfix expressions, we can extract and combine feature transformation techniques that enhance data variability and capture complex relationships. Let's carefully combine these transformations, ensuring a balance between complexity and interpretability:

Starting from the examples:

1. **Feature Set 1**:
   - f3: Original feature (counts for son's first occupation).
   - f4: Another categorical feature or transformed numerical feature.
   - f3 sqrt: Applying square root can reduce skewness in data.
   - f3 sqrt sqrt: Further reduces skewness.
   - f3 sqrt sqrt sqrt: Continuation but risk of diminishing returns.
   - f4 f4 +: Adding f4 to itself may increase variance.
   - f3 sin: Sin transformation captures periodic patterns.
   - f3 sqrt sqrt sin: Combines feature reduction with periodic capture.
   - f4 f4 + sin: Combines higher variance with periodic capture.
   - f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sin sin: Double sin capture on transformed data.

2. **Feature Set 2**:
   - f3: Original feature (counts for son's first occupation).
   - f4: Another categorical feature or transformed numerical feature.
   - f3 sin: Captures periodic patterns.
   - f3 sin sin: Further periodic capture, risk of noise.
   - f4 sqrt: Feature reduction for variance control.
   - f3 sqrt: Original variance reduction.
   - f3 sin sqrt: Combines periodic capture with variance control.
   - f4 sqrt sqrt: Continued variance control.

**New Feature Set** (optimized and better based on previous sets):

- f3
- f4
- f3 sqrt
- f4 sqrt
- f3 sin
- f3 sqrt sqrt sin: Combines square root transforms with sin for robust transformation, leveraging both variance reduction and periodic capture.
- f4 sqrt sqrt sin: Similar combination leveraging variance reduction and periodic effects.
- f3 sin sqrt: Ensures capture of periodicity with controlled variance.
- f3 tanh: Introduces hyperbolic tangent for sigmoid-like transformation, enhancing feature robustness against outliers.
- f4 quan_trans: Using quantile transformation for non-linear distillation of feature variance.

This new feature set efficiently combines transformations to ensure both the capture of complex patterns and robust data handling, which is often beneficial for improving model predictions, especially in classification tasks.

The goal is to create features that might offer better predictive value for the target class while ensuring diverse transformations are utilized:

1. Use transformations like `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `cube`, and `square` to capture non-linear relationships.
2. Apply scaling techniques such as `stand_scaler` (standard scaling) to normalize data and improve model performance.

In this set:
- Features `f2`, `f4 sin`, and `f1 sin square` are included for linear and non-linear interactions.
- `f3 sigmoid cube` applies both non-linear transformation (`sigmoid`) and polynomial expansion (`cube`) to potentially capture complex patterns in the data.
- `f0 tanh` and `f0 stand_scaler` introduce normalization effects that can help models perform better with feature scaling.
- `f3 f2 /` captures interactions between features using division, which can highlight ratios or proportions unaddressed in simple transformations.
- Composite transformations like `f4 cube tanh` and `f4 f3 cube *` explore combinations that can delve into deeper relationships of features.

- Introduced the interaction term `f3 * log(f4 + 1)`, which captures joint distribution characteristics between `f3` and `f4`.
- Retained the `cube` transformation for `f4`.
- Applied `cube sqrt` transformation to `f2` to explore combination effects further.
- Used `minmax_scaler cube` for `f4` to blend scaling and non-linear effects.
- Introduced `stand_scaler sqrt` transformation to standardize and reduce skew for `f3`.
- Added `quan_trans` to transform `f4`, potentially making it more Gaussian-like.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Farm_Laborer, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsman-Construction, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Proprietor, Service_Worker, Operative-Manufacturing, Manager, Professional_Self-Employed, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Clerk, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional-Salaried, Craftsman-Construction, Farm_Laborer, Salesman-Retail]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.5, Mean = 17.2574, Std = 46.5042

Data Examples:
fathers_occupation is Clerk. sons_occupation is Professional-Salaried. family_structure is nonintact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 40.5.
Answer: 0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Considering the examples you've provided, here's a new feature set you might consider:

```
[f4 sigmoid tanh ,f4 sigmoid tanh stand_scaler ,f4 tanh log ,f4 tanh square stand_scaler ,f4 sigmoid cos stand_scaler ,f3 sqrt f4 - f4 * stand_scaler ,f2 f4 - f4 * f0 f4 - f4 * * stand_scaler ,f3 f4 - f4 * f0 f4 - f4 * * cos ,f2 sqrt f4 - f3 sqrt f4 - f4 * * reciprocal ,f1 f4 - f4 * f3 f4 - f4 * * cos]
```

Explanation:
- This set combines non-linear transformations and feature interactions with scaling to capture complex relationships better.
- The use of operations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cos` introduces non-linearity, potentially improving prediction performance for classification tasks with non-linear boundaries.
- The scaling and standardizing operations like `stand_scaler` ensure that these transformed features are on comparable scales, which can help many machine learning algorithms converge faster and perform better.

2026-01-13 11:36:46,395 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we'll aim to create features that capture complex interactions and transformations that might help improve predictive performance. Here is a feature set created by combining and transforming the existing ones:

Explanation:
1. **f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler**: This combines `sigmoid`, `log`, and `stand_scaler`, which should normalize the transformed data. This is a typical preprocessing for numerical stability and improved learning.
  
2. **f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans**: Extends the transformation of `f4` with `quan_trans`, which is often used to tackle non-normal distributions, potentially benefiting models sensitive to normality.
  
3. **f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans +**: This feature involves a complex interaction, starting with `f1 square` and combining with `f3 cos log - f4 transformed`, which adds the previously created advanced transformation. This leverages both complex mathematical transformations and potential normalization.

4. **f0 f3 - tanh**: The difference between `f0` and `f3`, followed by `tanh`, which can handle distributions heavily affected by outliers or boundaries, enhancing model robustness.

5. **f1 f3 - tanh**: Similarly applies `tanh` to the difference between `f1` and `f3` to control for any extreme values and nonlinearities.

6. **f2 f4 sqrt /**: Featured as a division of `f2` by `f4 sqrt`, introducing interaction terms that may be more optimally handled by models sensitive to hierarchical or proportional relationships.

7. **f3 f0 - cube**: The difference between `f3` and `f0`, raised to the cube, which could capture non-linear interaction effects and strengthen predictive performance by accounting for deeper multiplication relationships.

These transformations and interactions are created to better capture underlying patterns within the data that could be pivotal in predicting the target variable effectively.

2026-01-13 11:36:57,880 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions for the given dataset, we need to utilize feature engineering effectively. Based on the provided feature sets `[f1, f3, f4, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f2 tanh sqrt, f3 tanh sqrt, f4 sqrt sqrt]` and `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 sin, f1 sin, f2 sin, f3 sin, f4 sqrt]`, I will suggest a new feature set incorporating transformations that could potentially capture more complex patterns and relationships.

Here is a proposed feature set, taking into account the benefits of both previous examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 sin, f1 tanh, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt sqrt, f4 cube, f1 sin sqrt, f2 tanh sqrt, f3 tanh, f4 sqrt]
```

Explanation:
- `f0 sin` is retained to capture periodic patterns associated with the father's occupation.
- `f1 tanh` introduces non-linearity, which can be useful for capturing subtle variations in son's occupation.
- `f2 sqrt` can assist in reducing skewness and stabilizing variance, beneficial for race feature.
- `f3 sqrt sqrt` is a further transformation of family structure, potentially capturing intricate distributions.
- `f4 cube` allows exploring more extreme transformations to enhance prediction power for weighted counts.
- `f1 sin sqrt`, `f2 tanh sqrt`, and `f3 tanh` utilize combinations of trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations to exploit complex inter-feature relationships.
- `f4 sqrt` continues to stabilize distributions for counts. 

These transformations are devised to leverage non-linear and periodic relationships, improve data distribution, and potentially increase the feature space dimensionality intelligently.

[f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler ,f4 sigmoid log quan_trans ,f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log + ,f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid stand_scaler + ,f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans ,f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler + ,f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log quan_trans + ,f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans + ,f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler * ,f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log quan_trans *]
```

In this feature set, I've maintained the use of various transformations (including logistic sigmoid, log, and scaling transformations) and combinations of features, which seem to improve the predictive power. Additionally, I've introduced multiplication operations after some transformations to further enhance the feature interactions.

### Explanation:
- **f0, f1, f2, f3, f4**: Including original features to retain the foundational data.
- **f0 f4 ***: Captures interaction between father’s occupation and the weighted counts of the son’s first occupation, potentially revealing correlations in continuity or deviation.
- **f1 f2 -**: Subtract son's occupation from family structure. This can highlight differences in occupational outcomes based on family backgrounds.
- **f3 f4 /**: Divides race by the weighted counts, potentially highlighting racial disparities in occupational outcomes at different levels of occupational counts.
- **f0 f2 /**: Ratio of father's occupation to family structure, which might capture socio-economic stress or harmony relating to family maintenance.
- **f4 tanh**: Maintained from your second example as it's a useful transformation for normalizing especially disparate weighted counts.

These transformations aim to enhance the predictive power of the features. 

Let's construct a new feature set that builds upon these ideas:

1. Start with transforming `f4` using complex combined transformations to capture non-linearities, and enhance its representation power with advanced scaling techniques.
2. Enhance interactions between `f1`, `f3`, and `f4` using a combination of mathematical operations and scaling techniques.

Here is the new postfix expression-based feature set:

```
[f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans sqrt ,f4 sigmoid sin minmax_scaler ,f1 square f3 cos log reciprocal + f4 sigmoid stand_scaler minmax_scaler + ,f1 square f3 cos log reciprocal + f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans sqrt + ,f1 square f3 cos log reciprocal + f4 sigmoid tanh stand_scaler + ,f1 square f3 cos log reciprocal + f4 sigmoid cube log stand_scaler + ,f1 square f3 cos log reciprocal + f4 sigmoid sin stand_scaler minmax_scaler tanh + ,f1 square f3 cos log reciprocal + f4 sigmoid sin log stand_scaler quan_trans sqrt +]
```

2026-01-13 11:38:10,420 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature examples provided, we can observe a few key points in generating transformed features:

1. **Combination and Transformation:** Both examples involve various operations on different features to generate new features. Operations include mathematical transformations (square, log, cos, etc.) and scaling/normalization transformations (stand_scaler, quan_trans).

2. **Complex Transformations:** The second example introduces more complex transformations by combining multiple operations on a single feature (e.g., square followed by tanh).

3. **Transformation Diversity:** There is a mix of simple transformations (e.g., cos, square) alongside more complex transformations (e.g., log after cos, square followed by tanh).

Considering these observations, a better feature set can be constructed by integrating additional transformation complexity, while offering scalability and potential increase in predictive power. Here’s a suggested transformed feature set based on your examples:

```

### Explanation of the New Features:
- **Square Root Transformations:** Applying `sqrt` and combining it with scaling can help stabilize variance and normalize the feature, suitable for highly skewed data.
- **Scaling Transformations:** Applying `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` after transformations to ensure the features are in a comparable range.
- **Complex Combinations:** Operations like `cos square`, `log cube`, and their subsequent scalings to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Diverse Non-linear Transforms:** Use of `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and `sin`, which can be particularly useful in models that benefit from non-linear interactions.
- **Feature Mixing:** Mixing the influence of different transformations can give insights into the interaction effects (e.g., log followed by cube).

2. Applying the `sigmoid` transformation to `f1`, and further scaling using `minmax_scaler`, capturing non-linear relationships between values in `f1`.
3. `f2` undergoes a `cube` transformation to amplify differences among values and then a `sqrt` to reduce the scale and spread.
4. The seamless integration of `minmax_scaler` after `tanh` transformation on `f4` will contrast extreme values effectively within a bounded scale.
5. Ensuring `f3` is scaled to [0, 1] with `minmax_scaler` and integrated with `sqrt` to maintain spread and ensure skewness is reduced.

This combination aims to leverage non-linear relationships and scale features efficiently for improved prediction capabilities.

2. Added a logarithmic transformation to `f2` (`f2 log`) to reduce skewness and stabilize variance.
3. Applied a square root transformation to `f4` (`f4 sqrt`) as it can help in normalizing the distribution of `f4` if it is skewed.
4. Retained standardized and scaled features (`f0 stand_scaler`, `f1 minmax_scaler`) for consistency and possibly improving model convergence.

Explanation of some chosen transformations:

- **stand_scaler**: Standard scaling for mean centering and variance normalization.
- **log** and **reciprocal**: Logarithm and reciprocal transformations can help manage skewness and non-linear relationships.
- **sigmoid, tanh**: Non-linear transformations to capture complex patterns.
- **quan_trans**: Quantile transformation is useful to map values to a normal distribution.
- **minmax_scaler** and **square, sqrt**: Combined these operations to help in scaling and polynomial transformations.

The second example simplifies scaling and transformations, which can be effective for ensuring features are within a similar range. The first example applies more complex transformations like logarithm and hyperbolic functions, which can help in non-linear modeling contexts.

Considering the complexity and useful transformations from both examples, here's a new feature set that combines the strengths with a focus on non-linear transformations and scaling:

- The transformations aim to capture non-linearities by incorporating functions like `cube`, `tanh`, and `sin`.
- Scaling operations like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are used to ensure consistency in feature ranges.
- A combination of complex mathematical transformations to handle various distributions is included.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:39:19,467 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and the operations allowed, let's construct a new feature set that combines transformations in a way that could potentially improve the prediction task. We'll consider using operations that standardize, reduce skewness, and emphasize interactions between features.

Here's a new generated feature set based on the given examples:

```
[f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans + ,f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans ,f3 cos log ,f1 square * f0 cos tanh ,f2 cos log stand_scaler ,f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler ,f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log + f2 cos *]
```

Explanation:
1. I selected `f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans +` because it combines multiple levels of feature transformation, including scaling and quantile transformation, which can help with normalizing and stabilizing variance.
2. I retained `f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler quan_trans` for its comprehensive transformation that could make the `f4` distribution more normal-like. 
3. `f3 cos log` provides a simple transformation that can sometimes linearize relationships.
4. I included a combination `f1 square * f0 cos tanh` as a complex inter-feature relationship.
5. `f2 cos log stand_scaler` adds a standardized simple transformation, making `f2` easier to handle.
6. Finally, `f1 square f3 cos log - f4 sigmoid log + f2 cos *` integrates various transformations into a composite feature.

Each of these features was selected for its potential to contribute valuable transformations that address distribution, scale, and interaction effects, which are crucial in predictive modeling, especially in cases where multicollinearity is a concern.
