```

This new feature set introduces:
- Interactions between `f0` and `f8` through addition.
- Multiplicative interactions involving `f11` to capture more complex relationships.
- A combination of multiple transformations on different features, such as logarithm of the product `f10 * f11`, multiplication, division, and non-linear transformations.
- The use of square root on interactions to assess any hidden nonlinear relationships.

The goal here is to explore a wider range of potential interactions and transformations, which may capture complex patterns in the data that individual features do not express. By doing so, you might be able to improve the predictive accuracy of models trained on these features.

Here is a new feature set leveraging various transformations and interactions:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:
1. **Interaction Terms:**
   - Using products like `f8 f9 *`, `f8 f10 *`, and `f9 f10 *` to capture interactions between key variables (e.g., temperature and humidity).
   - Introducing `f8 f9 sqrt *` to explore non-linear interactions.

2. **Non-linear Transformations:**
   - Apply logarithmic transformations (`f8 log`, `f9 log`, `f10 log`) to reduce skewness and potentially highlight multiplicative relationships.
   - Use square roots as a moderate transformation to deal with skewness and enhance variation (`f9 f9 sqrt`, `f8 sqrt`, `f9 sqrt`, `f10 sqrt`, `f11 sqrt`).

3. **Scaling and Normalization:**
   - Implement min-max scaling (`f8 minmax_scaler`, `f9 minmax_scaler`, `f10 minmax_scaler`) to bring features to a similar scale.
   - Leverage combinations with min-max (`f8 f9 + minmax_scaler`) to deal with interactions effectively.

4. **Trigonometric Transformations:**
   - Using `f8 sin`, `f9 cos` can be beneficial when dealing with periodic cycles (e.g., hourly or seasonal patterns).
   - Introducing `f9 tanh` for smooth, bounded transformations that can stabilize variability. 

This comprehensive approach ensures we are capturing a range of potential relationships within the data that could be beneficial for enhancing predictive modeling.

This feature set incorporates interactions between various features using multiplication, applies non-linear transformations like `square`, `log`, `cube`, and `cos`, and uses scaling techniques such as `stand_scaler` and normalization methods like `sigmoid`. By combining these operations creatively, we better capture underlying patterns in the data for improved predictions of total rental bike counts.

This set includes nonlinear transformations that attempt to capture complex relationships from the original features, particularly those that might help in modeling seasonal variations, time-of-day effects, or weather dependencies, which are all relevant for bike rental counts. Additionally, scaling and combining these transformed features might help in better differentiating between nuanced patterns in the input data.

### Explanation:
- **Original features (f0 to f11)**: Keep the original features for baseline modeling.
- **`f11 log`**: Log transformation of windspeed might normalize its distribution.
- **`f0 sin`, `f1 tanh`, `f2 cos`**: Apply trigonometric functions to seasonal cycles (season, year, and month), potentially capturing cyclical patterns.
- **`f3 cube`**: Captures higher-order effects for the hour feature, which can be vital for representing time-based peaks in bike rentals.
- **`f7 sqrt`**: Square root of temperature reduces the variance impact of higher temperature values.
- **`f8 stand_scaler`**: Standard scaling of humidity to center around zero.
- **`f9 minmax_scaler`**: Normalizes feel temperature values between 0 and 1.
- **`f10 reciprocal`**: Applies reciprocal transformation to see if inverse relationships exist regarding wind speed.
- **`f9 + f10`, `f8 * f10`, `f7 / f11`**: Create interaction features between temperature-related variables, humidity, and wind speed to capture interactions.
- **`f11 f11 *`**: Quadratic term of windspeed to capture potential nonlinear effects.
- **`f0 sigmoid`, `f7 sigmoid`**: Sigmoid transformation of seasonal pattern and temperature. This can reduce the effect of outlier seasonal patterns and temperatures.
- **`f9 tanh`**: Applies hyperbolic tangent on feel temperature for smooth transitions, capturing nonlinear relationships.

```

In this enhanced feature set:
- Non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `square`, `log`, and `reciprocal` are applied to capture complex relationships.
- Feature interaction terms are given further depth with operations like `cube`, `*`, `/`, and `+`.
- Scalers like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` are used to normalize the features effectively. 
- Emphasis is placed on leveraging combinations that might capture interactions between the `feeling temperature`, `humidity`, `windspeed`, and hourly patterns, which are intuitive factors influencing bike rentals.

This set attempts to balance complexity with potential predictive power, offering diverse transformations to capture underlying patterns in the data.

2026-01-13 14:50:51,903 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions, it's important to experiment with various feature transformations and derive engineered features that capture underlying patterns in the data effectively. Based on the given examples, I've noticed a recurring use of operations like `quan_trans`, `tanh`, and `cos`. The transformations seem to focus on the `hour` feature (f3), likely due to its periodic nature and potential impact on bike rentals.

Here is an improved feature set following the format and concept:

[f3, f3 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans tanh, f3 quan_trans cos,  f3 cos, f3 tanh, f3 tanh cos, f3 tanh cos tanh, f3 quan_trans tanh cos, f3 quan_trans tanh cos tanh, f3 quan_trans tanh cos tanh quan_trans, f9 square quan_trans, f9 square tanh, f9 square, f8 tanh, f9 tanh cos, f8 cos, f9 cos, f5 minmax_scaler, f5 tanh, f11 sin quan_trans, f11 * f10 quan_trans, f3 * f7, f3 * f5, f3/f7, f8*f3/f9]

In this feature set:
- Continued use of `quan_trans`, `cos`, and `tanh` transformations for capturing nonlinear relationships.
- Introduced interactions and combinations with `season` (f5) and `temp` (f8), `humidity` (f9), and `windspeed` (f11) to explore potential interactions effects.
- Included operations like `minmax_scaler` on the `season` feature (f5) to normalize its impact.
- Enhanced the effect of interactions between features by combining them via multiplication and division, potentially capturing interactions between environmental conditions and time-specific behaviors.

This combination is exploratory and aims to extract more nuanced features that reflect potential interactions and nonlinear relationships affecting bike rental counts, while maintaining the structure and depth of transformations as seen in the examples provided.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Features [f2, f3, f8, f9, f10]:** Start with a selection of the original continuous features (e.g., temperature, feel_temp, etc.).

2. **Transformations:**
   - **Reciprocal, Tanh, Sigmoid:** Useful for normalizing values and exploring nonlinear transformations.
   - **Standard Scaling and Quantile Transformation:** Capture distributional properties and make features more Gaussian-like.
   - **Combination Transformations:** Use combinations of operations to capture complex relationships, such as `f8 stand_scaler quan_trans sigmoid`.

3. **Chaining Transformations:** Using a stack of transformations like `f2 reciprocal tanh sigmoid sigmoid` helps model intricate relationships while controlling for fluctuating ranges in data.

This set combines nonlinear transformations and scale adjustments to help capture complex patterns in the data, effectively preparing it for the prediction task.

2026-01-13 14:51:31,031 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples and their operations, we aim to generate a more effective feature set for predicting bike rentals using feature engineering techniques. Observing the previous transformations that utilize operations such as cube, sqrt, log, and tanh, it seems beneficial to expand those to additional features and incorporate others such as standard scaling or min-max scaling for normalization.

Here's a new feature set example building upon the previous ones:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f2 log ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh , f0 square , f5 reciprocal , f11 minmax_scaler , f3 stand_scaler , f6 cube , f7 quan_trans , f10 sqrt , f4 sigmoid]
```

Explanation and reasoning behind feature selection:

1. **f0 square**: Squaring might capture nonlinear season effects on bike rentals.
   
2. **f5 reciprocal**: Reciprocal of weekday helps to emphasize the impact of weekend days.
   
3. **f11 minmax_scaler**: Normalizes windspeed which is essential for improving model convergence.

4. **f3 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling on hour could be important for capturing usage patterns throughout the day more effectively.

5. **f6 cube**: Cubing working day might help emphasize differences across working and non-working days.

6. **f7 quan_trans**: Applying quantile transformation to weather could better distinguish between fine weather conditions.

7. **f10 sqrt**: Reducing feature range for humidity may help stabilize its contribution.

8. **f4 sigmoid**: Smooths holiday impact on bike rentals and emphasizes its extremities.

This feature set potentially enhances model predictions by incorporating non-linear transformations, normalizations, and scale adjustments in ways tuned to the nuances of the dataset.

2026-01-13 14:51:56,511 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature transformation sets, the latter set is considered better. It is more compact and removes unnecessary transformations, providing a strong starting point for model improvements while remaining computationally efficient. 

Building on this foundation and considering common feature engineering practices, we can create a new and potentially more effective feature set by adding a few important transformations, such as standard scaling and logarithmic transformations for skewed distributions. Here is an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler, f10 log, f3 sqrt, f4 square]
```

### Rationale:
- **`f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler`:** Applying standard scaling to some features (e.g., temperature, feel temperature, wind speed) can help improve model convergence and performance, especially for models sensitive to feature scaling, such as linear regression or neural networks.
- **`f10 log`:** Logarithmic transformation often helps stabilize the variance of a feature that is skewed, such as humidity, enhancing linearity in methods like regression.
- **`f3 sqrt`:** Square root transformation can help stabilize variances and improve normality for features such as hour, which can help certain models.
- **`f4 square`:** Squaring the `holiday` feature can help capture any potential nonlinear effects, even if we initially consider the categorically encoded features.
- **`f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11`:** Keeping the original features ensures that we maintain all initial information content, as changes may lose nuanced patterns that are crucial to accurate prediction.

These transformations were chosen to balance complexity with potential improvements in prediction accuracy, considering model requirements and common data preprocessing practices.

These operations are selected to potentially capture non-linear relationships and normalize the data for better model performance.

Here's a new feature set example:

```

**Explanation of Transformations:**

1. **f3 sin**: Evaluating the sine transformation of the hour feature could capture cyclical patterns associated with daily bike rentals.
   
2. **f8 minmax_scaler**: Normalizing the temperature feature between 0 and 1 may help in stabilizing the model training.

3. **f10 reciprocal**: Taking the reciprocal of humidity might help model its inverse relationship with bike rentals (e.g., drier days may have higher rentals).

4. **f11 stand_scaler**: Standardizing windspeed to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 can make this feature more interpretable in linear models.

5. **f0 square**: Squaring the season feature might capture quadratic effects related to the number of bike rentals.

6. **f7 log**: Applying a log transformation on weather could handle skewness and highlight differences in bike rentals due to changing weather conditions.

7. **f5 tanh**: Using hyperbolic tangent on weekday could help in smooth transitions highlighting the differences between weekdays and weekends.

8. **f9 sigmoid**: Applying sigmoid on feel_temp helps in handling this feature's impact smoothly, making extreme values less influential but more relevant in a probabilistic sense.

These transformations are selected to optimize pattern recognition and improve the predictive capability of the model.

The feature sets presented differ in complexity, with the latter being simpler and the assumption that more complex transformations (if chosen thoughtfully) could enrich the feature representation which can, in turn, improve prediction performance. Here's a proposal for a new feature set:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation of Transformations:
- **Rescaled Features**: Using `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` normalizes the data and could help certain algorithms perform better.
  
- **Quantile Transformation**: `quan_trans` is applied to bring data into a more Gaussian-like distribution, which can benefit algorithms sensitive to non-normal features.

- **Square Root, Logarithm and Reciprocal**: These transformations can reduce skewness and handle variability differently. Applying them can sometimes reveal hidden patterns.

- **Cube Transformation**: Expanding the feature space with higher-degree terms can capture more complex relationships between variables.

- **Tanh and Sigmoid**: These non-linear transformations are often useful when capturing complex patterns by introducing non-linearity.

By including simple rescaling, non-linear transformations, and higher-order transformations, this enhances the feature space diversity, giving a model more opportunity to learn complex relationships in the data. It’s essential, though, that the performance is validated on a separate validation set because complex features can sometimes lead to overfitting.

Explanation:
- `f0 stand_scaler`: Standardizing the 'season' feature may help reduce differences between categorical values, providing more uniform input for modeling.
- `f1 square`: Squaring the 'year' feature could help capture potential quadratic trends over the two recorded years.
- `f2 tanh`: Applying the tanh transformation to 'month' could help capture cyclical patterns typically associated with months.
- `f8 cube`: Cubing the 'temp' feature might capture complex interactions or nonlinear relationships related to temperature effects.
- `f9 minmax_scaler`: Scaling 'feel_temp' allows better integration with other scaled features.
- `f3 sqrt`: Taking the square root of 'hour' might help capture less linear effects during different times of the day.
- `f5 log`: The log transformation on 'workingday' may highlight differences more clearly when combined with other continuous features.
- `f6 reciprocal`: Applying the reciprocal transformation to 'weather' could help capture inverse relationships between weather severity and bike rentals.
- `f11 quan_trans`: Quantile transformation of 'windspeed' might offer a way to normalize high variability and handle skewed distributions.
- `f4 sqrt`: The square root of 'holiday' might provide more nuanced separation between holidays and ordinary days.
- `f7 sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation of 'weekday' could help handle non-linear effects related to the day of the week.
- `f10 tanh`: Applying tanh on 'humidity', often non-linearly impacting bike rental, might improve prediction accuracy. 

These transformed features aim to enhance model predictions by incorporating non-linear relationships and adjusted scaling where beneficial.

The goal is to extract features that might capture more complex patterns or regularities in the data, which might not be apparent through basic transformations.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:

1. **Logarithm of f0**: Can help normalize skewed data.
2. **Cubic Transformation of f1**: Captures potential nonlinear patterns.
3. **Ratio of f8 to f9**: A new interaction feature to capture relative effects of these variables.
4. **Standard Scaling of f10**: Normalizes the distribution to have mean zero and standard deviation of 1.
5. **Sigmoid of f11**: Compresses the values between 0 and 1.
6. **Square root transformations on f0, f3, f6 and f1**: Helps manage skewed data.
7. **Square of f2 and f7**: These transformations can capture non-linear relationships.
8. **TanH of f4 and f5**: This transformation saturates values between -1 and 1 and is useful for compressing outliers.
9. **Min-Max Scaling of f8**: Rescales to the [0, 1] range.
10. **Logarithm of f8 and f9**: This transformation is useful for reducing skewness and stabilizing variance.

This feature engineering set is designed to capture non-linearities and interactions among features while normalizing them to potentially enhance model performance.

Given the two examples, I'll suggest an improved feature set that builds upon them by including more transformations that might capture additional useful patterns:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f0 cube, f1 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f10 cube, f11 sqrt, f11 cube, f8 square, f9 square, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler]
```

In this feature set, I've retained the original features and transformations from the latter example while adding some potential new transformations:

1. Included \( f8 \) and \( f9 \) squared to capture potential quadratic relationships for temperature and feel_temp.
2. Applied `minmax_scaler` to \( f8 \) and \( f9 \) to normalize temperature-related features, potentially helpful for models sensitive to feature scale. 

These enhancements may help the predictive model learn more complex relationships in the data, especially related to temperature and its effect on bike rental counts.

2026-01-13 14:54:37,693 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, we can see an evolution in feature engineering techniques moving from scaling to more complex transformations including square roots and min-max scaling. To further improve the feature set for predicting bike rental counts, let's introduce some additional transformations that could capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. Here's a suggested feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11

 f3 sin ,f3 cos ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh 
 f8 * f9 ,f10 * f11 ,f3 * f8
 f3 reciprocal ,f7 reciprocal]
```

Key considerations and transformations:
- **Time-based features (`f3`, `hour`)**: Applied `sin` and `cos` transformations to capture cyclical patterns in hourly data, which can be significant in daily bike rental patterns.
- **Non-linear transformations (`f8`, `temp`, and `f9`, `feel_temp`)**: `tanh` transformation captures saturation effects that temperature and feel temperature might imply in usage patterns.
- **Interaction terms**: Introduced combinations like `f8 * f9` and `f10 * f11` to capture potential interactions between temperature-related and scaled weather/humidity-related features.
- **Reciprocal transformation**: Applied to `f3` (`hour`) and `f7` (`weather`) to capture inverse relationships, which might be valuable in understanding peak times and adverse weather conditions.

These adjustments aim at capturing more complex relationships and interactions within the dataset, which could potentially enhance prediction accuracy.

```

### Explanation:
- **Transformation and Scaling:** 
  - Use `quan_trans`, `minmax_scaler`, and `stand_scaler` to normalize and scale features, which helps models learn more effectively.
  
- **Interaction Features:**
  - Calculate interactions between pairs of features (e.g., `f0 * f3`, `f8 * f9`).
  
- **Non-linear Transformations:**
  - Use `cube`, `sigmoid`, `log`, and `tanh` transformations to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
  
These transformations can potentially improve the predictive power by allowing the model to capture more complex patterns and relationships in the data.

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Transformations (sqrt, square, log):** Applying these transformations helps in normalizing the variance and introducing non-linearity. For instance, square transformations for positively skewed variables may improve model performance.

2. **Normalization and Scaling (minmax_scaler, stand_scaler):** These techniques are crucial, especially when features have different units or scales. 

3. **Interaction Terms and Ratios (*, /):** Interaction terms like `f0 * f3` capture the effect of two features together, and the division such as `f3 / f5` helps model proportional relationships.

4. **Non-linear Functions (tanh, sin, cos, sigmoid):** Non-linear transformations can map linear dependencies into non-linear space, providing more nuanced interpretations especially for cyclical features like `hour`.

5. **Advanced Transformations (reciprocal, cube, quan_trans):** These help address the skewness and provide Box-Cox-like transformations for normally distributed data.

This combination should offer a rich set of features for the downstream task of predicting bike rentals, accounting for both the inherent non-linear nature of environmental and temporal factors and maintaining a robust interpretation within the machine learning model's context.

- `f8 minmax_scaler`: Scaling humidity to a 0-1 range using min-max scaling to ensure it contributes significantly and comparably to other features like feel_temp (`f9`), year (`f1`), or temp (`f8`).
- `f9 sqrt`: Applying the square root to feel_temp to potentially capture certain distributions or highlight smaller differences in temperatures, which might be impactful for bike rentals.

Data Examples:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

```

Here are the highlights of the added transformations:

1. `f8 / (f9 + 0.001)`: This feature assesses the ratio of temperature to feeling temperature, adding a small constant to prevent division by zero.

2. `f7 * f10`: Interaction between weather and humidity can capture joint effects.

3. `f0 minmax_scaler`, `f1 minmax_scaler`: Scaling year and month to the [0, 1] range for consistent impact across models.

4. `(f5 + f6) / 2`: Average of weekday and working day can give a blended measure of regular working patterns.

5. `f8 * f9 * f10`: Captures interaction among temperature, feeling temperature, and humidity, addressing non-linear thermal comfort effects.

6. `f11 log`: Log transformation can stabilize variance and reduce skewness for windspeed.

7. `f3 * f10 tanh`: Interaction between hour and humidity passed through the hyperbolic tangent to capture non-linear effects of timing and moisture.

8. `f4 / (f11 + 1) sqrt`: Normalizes holiday by windspeed, reduced skew by transformation using square root.

These transformations aim to capture intricate relationship dynamics and enhance the predictive power of the model.

### Explanation:

1. **Retained useful transformations**: 
   - The cube transformation was applied heavily in the latter example and helps capture potential non-linear relationships.
   - The tanh transformation was used multiple times; it's useful for non-linear modeling.
   - The minmax_scaler and square transformations were common and typically aid in standardizing inputs and emphasizing quadratic relationships.

2. **Incorporated new transformations**:
   - **Sqrt and reciprocal** for exploring different representations of non-linear relationships in temporal features like `hour`.
   - **Sigmoid** transformation applied to `f2` (month) and `f11` (windspeed) to capture potential seasonal patterns and wind effect in a non-linear scalable manner.

3. **Diversity**: Ensuring a variety of transformations helps generalize patterns that linear models might miss while avoiding redundancy.

In this improved version:

- Non-linear transformations (`sin`, `cos`, `tanh`) are applied to transform the temperature and humidity features, which may reveal hidden periodic patterns.
- Quantile transformation followed by squaring is applied to `temp` and `feel_temp` to enhance normal distribution and then amplify differences.
- `reciprocal` is applied to `season`, `year`, and `month` to potentially stabilize variance and improve prediction sensitivity.
- Log transformation is applied to `weekday` and `hour` for variance stabilization.
- Cube transformation is retained for `windspeed` and `humidity` to enhance outlier management and model interaction effects.

- **log transformation**: Added for `f0` to handle data with exponential growth or skewness.
- **minmax_scaler**: Continued for `f8` to bring values between 0 to 1, which may be useful for models sensitive to input scale.
- **sigmoid transformation**: For `f11` (windspeed), to represent the bounded effect winds might have on bike rentals.
- **stand_scaler**: Added for `f9` (humidity), standardization could improve model convergence.

I excluded redundant transformations and introduced diversity to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

2026-01-13 14:58:27,098 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, we can incorporate a range of transformations to enhance the predictive power of the dataset. We can apply transformations that have been left out in the previous examples, maintain a focus on combinations of original features, and consider transformations that capture nonlinear relationships.

Here's an improved feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:

- **f3 sqrt:** Square root of hour, which helps to capture less linear relationships between the hour of the day and rental bikes.
- **f4 tanh:** Tanh transformation on the binary holiday feature, which helps in scenarios where sigmoid-like transformations are useful.
- **f10 sigmoid:** Applies a sigmoid transformation to the windspeed to smooth out extreme values.
- **f11 minmax_scaler:** Normalizes humidity to a 0–1 range, improving linear model performance.
- **f6 * f8:** Interaction term between working day and temperature which might reveal dependency on weekday work pattern with temperature.
- **f7 * f9:** Interaction term between weather and feel temp to capture potential compound effects affecting rental numbers.
- **f0 + f6:** Considering an additive interaction between season and working day, as part of seasonal patterns might reflect more during work days.
- **f1 - f11:** Capturing a simple interaction indicating how the year impacts different levels of humidity.

By blending these transformations and interactions, this feature set aimsto capture potential nonlinear relationships and interactions in the data, potentially improving the predictive accuracy for the total rental bikes.

To propose an enhanced feature set, I will incorporate transformations focusing on potential non-linear relationships and further techniques to stabilize variance and handle non-normal distributions.

Here's a proposed improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

This set includes:

1. **Quantile Transformation** on most initial features (`f0` to `f10`) to reduce the impact of outliers and stabilize distributions.
2. **Log Transformation** on `f0` and `f1` to manage potential skewness.
3. **Cube Transformation** on several features (`f2` to `f7`) to capture non-linear relationships.
4. **Reciprocal Transformation** on selected features (`f8`, `f9`, and `f11`) to handle features with high variance.
5. **TanH Activation** on features (`f8`, `f9`, and `f11`) to compress and normalize feature values.
6. Combination Windows:
   - **Cube and Square Root**: Applied on `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to explore higher-order non-linear interactions.
   - **Log and Square Root**: Applied on `f0` and `f1` to further standardize skewed distributions.
   - Maintains **Cube Transformations of Quantile Transformed Features** (`f8` and `f9`) to capture complex trends.

These transformations are implemented to extract more intricate patterns and interactions tuned for predicting bike rental counts, given the likely non-linear nature and complex dependencies within the input data set.

**New Feature Set:**

### Explanation of the New Features:

1. **Transformation Variety**: 
   - Used different types of transformation (e.g., cube, log, sqrt, tanh) on various features to capture nonlinear relationships.

2. **Reciprocal Transformation**: 
   - Applied to `f6` and `f10` to handle inversely proportional relationships.

3. **Sigmoid Transformation**: 
   - Helps in binning outputs to categorize transformations into a pseudo-probability.

4. **Standardization and Scaling**:
   - Min-max scaling and standard scaling can normalize distributions, making models less sensitive to outliers and improving convergence in gradient-based models.

5. **Feature Interaction**: 
   - Using functions like cube, square, and sqrt can help identify interaction effects and polynomials within the features, capturing complex underlying relationships.

The new set should help the machine learning model learn richer representations of the data and identify complex relationships, thereby potentially improving predictive performance on the task.

2026-01-13 15:00:06,575 - INFO - llm output = Based on the features and transformations provided, it's useful to focus on generating new features that can offer a more nuanced interpretation of the original data set. Here, I'll combine some transformations with the suggestions in your examples for potentially improved feature engineering:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f8 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid]

Here are a few reasons why these transformations might be beneficial:

1. **Tanh and Sigmoid transformations on humidity and windspeed**: These transformations are often helpful for normalizing features, especially when dealing with features that can impact rental decisions non-linearly, such as humidity and wind speed.

2. **Square root transformations**: These help to reduce skewness in distributions, which might be present in features like season, year, etc.

3. **Min-max scaling**: It is effective for keeping numerical features within a certain range, specifically when you have machine learning models that are sensitive to feature scales.

4. **Quantile transformation**: This transformation maps data to a normal distribution, making it useful for handling non-Gaussian distributions in features, which can improve many machine learning models.

This combination uses variations of scaling and non-linear transformation to address potential irregularities and dependencies in the data, hoping to improve model accuracy and robustness.

2026-01-13 15:00:37,127 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and the task to improve predictions for the count of total rental bikes, I will suggest a new set of feature transformations that can capture potential non-linear relationships and interactions. The goal is to create a feature set that could enhance the modeling performance when predicting bike rentals.

Here's a new feature set, enhancing the transformations by incorporating more interactions and complex transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11,

 f8 quan_trans * f11, f9 quan_trans * f10, f2 log, f10 tanh]
```

### Explanation:

- **Non-linear transformations**: Cubic and logarithmic transformations are applied to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Scaling**: Standard scaler, min-max scaler, and quantile transformations are used to normalize and equalize the distribution of the features, which could help some models perform better.
- **Sigmoid and Tanh Transformations**: These transformations can help compress the range of certain features and handle extreme values effectively.
- **Interactions**: Interaction terms like `f0 * f3`, `f8 * f9`, and new interactions such as `f8 quan_trans * f11`, `f9 quan_trans * f10` are added to capture synergistic effects between features.
- **Feature Combos**: Adding sums and product interactions to capture more complex relationships between features.
  
This combination of transformations and interactions is designed to expand the feature space, giving a machine learning model a better foundation to discern underlying patterns and improve predictions.

### Explanation:
- **`f9 sqrt`**: Continuing with the transformation of the `f9` feature using the square root, which can handle skewness in data.
- **`f8 stand_scaler * f10`**: Standard scaling of `f8` (temperature) and then multiplying it by `f10` (humidity). This could capture interactions between temperature and humidity that affect bike usage.
- **`f11 log + f10`**: Taking the logarithm of the wind speed (`f11`) and adding it to `f10` (humidity). This might better capture the relationship of conditions affecting bikers.
- **`f1 * f7`**: Multiplying `f1` (year) by `f7` (weather condition). This can capture any potential temporal change in weather effects over different years.

Each of these transformations is designed to explore potentially complex interactions or redistributions in the data that might better inform the underlying prediction model.

I'll also try to introduce a new transformation in the same spirit as the given examples. 

Here is a new proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f0 cube, f1 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f10 cube, f8 quan_trans cube, f9 quan_trans cube, f11 sigmoid, f10 sqrt, f9 log]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Existing Features:** Retain the original features and already established transformations (e.g., quantile transformations, cube).

2. **New Transformation - `f10 sqrt`:** Square root transformation of `f10` (windspeed). Wind speed is often skewed, and a square root transformation can help to normalize this feature distribution, which might improve the model's ability to learn from this variable.

3. **New Transformation - `f9 log`:** Log transformation of `f9` (humidity). Logarithmic transformation is useful for compressing the range of variables, especially when the feature can have values spanning multiple magnitudes. This can be particularly helpful if the effect of humidity on bike rentals diminishes as humidity rises.

**Explanations of some transformations:**

1. **Square Root** was used to handle potential skewness or reduce variance for numerical features.
2. **Min-Max Scaling** and **Quantile Transformation** were used to normalize the distribution of `temp` and `feel_temp` which might make any non-linear relationships more linear.
3. **Sigmoid** is applied to normalize features into a specific range which may be useful for algorithms sensitive to the scale.
4. **Reciprocal** and **Log** transformations help in reducing skewness in `windspeed` since wind speeds can vary a lot.
5. **Average of `temp` and `feel_temp`:** Combining both features highlights overall comfort.
6. **Standard Scaler** was used on categorical-numeric features like `season` and `year` to assess their scaled impact. 
7. **Interaction Terms** create new features to capture the combined effect of `month` and `windspeed`.
8. **Cube** on some features like month and hour is combined to capture periodicity and non-linear trends in bike usage closely.

This transformed set provides a comprehensive approach to capturing potential complex interactions and non-linear patterns within the data, all of which might improve model performance.

2026-01-13 15:03:57,471 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by utilizing feature engineering transformations, let’s consider expanding on the trend in the examples you’ve provided. We’ll incorporate a mix of transformations such as scaling, transformation, and non-linear functions to capture potential non-linear relationships and interactions between different features. Here’s a proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f9 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f11 stand_scaler ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f4 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f7 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f11 tanh ,(f0 minmax_scaler * f8 minmax_scaler) ,(f9 log + f10 log) ,f1/f3 ,f7*sin(f4)]
```

**Explanation of Transformations Applied:**

1. **Standard Scaler (`stand_scaler`)**: This transformation will standardize each feature by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This can be particularly useful for the numerical features to ensure that each feature contributes equally in distance calculations.

2. **Hyperbolic Tangent (`tanh`)**: This is a non-linear transformation that maps values into the range of -1 to 1, which might help in normalizing the effect of high magnitude features.

3. **Interaction Terms**:
   - Combine the scaled `f0` and `f8` features with multiplication as `(f0 minmax_scaler * f8 minmax_scaler)`, capturing the interaction which might reveal underlying relationships.
   - Sum the logarithmic transformations `f9 log` and `f10 log` to potentially capture synergy between these features.
   - The division of `f1/f3` to express the relationship between year and hour, which might capture trends varying by hour across years.
   - Use `f7*sin(f4)` to capture patterns in bike rental influenced by the trigonometric component of `season` and `temp`.

These additional engineered features aim to enrich the dataset by cleverly using mathematical and scaling transformations to potentially uncover hidden patterns, nonlinear relationships, and interactions that are present in the data relating to bike rentals.

2026-01-13 15:04:02,857 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by building on the examples provided, it's ideal to combine transformations that capture non-linear relationships, normalize the data, and enhance interpretability. Here's a proposed feature set:

\[ 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f0 cube, f1 square, f2 log, f3 sin, f4 cos, f5 tanh, f6 minmax\_scaler, f7 stand\_scaler, f8 tanh, f9 sqrt, f10 cube, f11 sigmoid, f0 f1 *, f2 f3 /, f8 f9 +, f10 f11 -] 
\]

Here are the considerations for this feature set:
- Different transformations are used to capture unique aspects of each feature, such as trigonometric functions for cyclical features (e.g., hour) and non-linear transformations like cube and square.
- Scaling transformations (e.g., minmax_scaler, stand_scaler) help normalize features, facilitating model convergence and performance.
- Combined features (products, sums, and differences) can reveal interactions between original features.
- Using a mix of basic statistical transformations (log, sqrt) enhances capturing skewness in data distribution.

```

**Additions and Modifications Explained:**

1. **Square Roots:** Added square roots of important features such as `f8`, `f9`, and `f11` to capture potential non-linear scaling.

2. **Interactions:**
   - Added interaction terms like `f8 * f11` to explore relationships between temperature, humidity, and wind speed/all-features that might influence bike rentals.
   - Combined multiple features: `f1 + f4 + f7` to capture possible seasonal interactions.
   - Included cube-tanh interaction: `f3 cube * f10 tanh`, where complex interactions with the hour of the day could capture peaks, like rush hours.

3. **Complex Ratios and Products:**
   - Enhanced complex transformations by adding more feature products, such as `(f0 / f3) sqrt` to potentially capture temporal dynamics.
   - And another feature interaction term `f2 * f5 * f6` to explore compounded effects of weekday and working day.

These transformations and interactions offer a good mix of non-linear transformations and combinations that can capture complex patterns related to bike rentals.

### Explanation of Additional Feature Transformations:
- **`f3 minmax_scaler`**: Scale `hour` because of its linear and critical relationship with time-based patterns for bike rentals.
- **`f4 cube`**: Cube transformation for `holiday` to introduce non-linearity, potentially capturing complex holiday effects.
- **`f9 sigmoid`**: Apply sigmoid to `windspeed` for potential non-linear patterns.
- **`(f10 + f11) /`**: Dividing `humidity` by `windspeed` can offer insights into how these interact, affecting perceived conditions.
- **`f0 * f4`**: Interaction between `season` and `holiday`, possibly capturing seasonal holiday effects.
- **`f9 sqrt`**: Square root of `windspeed`, another transformation to model the windspeed effect differently.
- **`f5 + f6`**: Summation of `weekday` and `workingday` to explore their combined effect.
- **`f7 tanh`**: `weather` condition's non-linear transformation to capture varying weather effects.
- **`f2 sin`**: Sine transformation on `month` to capture periodic seasonal effects. 

These transformations are chosen to balance complexity and interpretability, aiming to improve model performance by potentially uncovering hidden relationships in the data.

For a better feature set, we will leverage a combination of nonlinear transformations, scaling, and normalization techniques to capture more complex relationships. 

Here's a new feature set:

```

### Explanation of Choices:
1. **Quantile Transformations:** Applied to all original features to handle potential skewness in distributions and make the data more Gaussian-like.

2. **Reciprocal Transformations:** Applied to features where making very small values more prominent might help capture inverse relationships. 

3. **Log Transformations:** Applied to all features to reduce skewness and manage large ranges, making feature distributions more symmetric.

4. **Standard Scaling:** Applied to `f10` and `f11` to center and scale these features for normal distribution, potentially improving model performance if these features have high variance.

5. **Cube and Square Root Combination:** Used to capture non-linear relationships and variabilities, combining cube transformations with square roots to enhance normalization on larger scales.

6. **Sigmoid and Tanh Transformations:** Applied to `f8`, `f9`, and `f11` to squash features into a constant range and emphasize values near the mean.

These transformations are based on common transformations that can enhance the learning capacity of models and potentially improve predictive performance by diversifying the feature set representation.

We'll aim to create transformations that exploit non-linear relationships, scale the features appropriately, and provide diverse transformations that could be beneficial.

Here is a new feature set, considering the operations and combinations that could yield useful patterns and non-linear transformations in the data:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f0 log, f1 tanh, f2 sqrt, f3 cube, f4 sin, f5 cos, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 reciprocal, f9 log, f10 sigmoid, f11 /]
```

Explanation of Additional Features:
- `f0 log`: Log transformation of `f0` could help stabilize variance in data with exponential growth.
- `f1 tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent of `f1` can help compress values to a smaller bounded scale.
- `f2 sqrt`: Square root transformation of `f2`, which is `month`, can address non-linear relationships.
- `f3 cube`: Cubic transformation of `f3`, emphasizing larger discrepancies in `hour` effects.
- `f4 sin` and `f5 cos`: Sine and cosine transformations on `f4` and `f5`, which can model cyclic/periodic behavior like seasonality and hours.
- `f6 minmax_scaler`: Scaling `weekday` using minmax scaling to standardize between 0 and 1.
- `f7 stand_scaler`: Standardizing `weather` to have zero mean and unit variance, potentially useful for categorical-to-numerical conversion.
- `f8 reciprocal`: Reciprocal transformation of `temp` to handle skewness; also handles zeros naturally.
- `f9 log`: Log transformation of `feel_temp` for stabilizing variance potentially skewed towards higher 'feeling' temperatures.
- `f10 sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation of `humidity`, compressing into [0, 1] range, possibly addressing outliers.
- `f11 /`: Just included as a regular feature to check performance against transformed features.

This feature engineering aims to capture non-linear patterns, ensure numerical stability, and provide variety in how raw input correlations can manifest in predictions.

The second example seems to emphasize transformations such as quantile transformation, cube, and sigmoid. Let's propose a new feature set that balances complexity and potential relevance to the bike rental counts:

Proposed Feature Set:
```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f0 cube, f1 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f10 cube, f8 quan_trans cube, f9 quan_trans cube, f11 sigmoid, f11 log, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f0 * f3, f8 * f9, f5 * f10, f3 / f11, f8 + f9, f2 log, f10 tanh, f4 square, f1 / f5, f6 - f7, f2 sqrt, f0 cos, f9 * f10]
```

**Explanation of Additions:**

1. **Basic Mathematical Operations**:
   - Added `f4 square` to capture the non-linear influence of `season` on the bike rental counts, especially if certain seasons have significantly higher or lower rentals.
   
2. **Interaction Terms**:
   - `f1 / f5` introduces the ratio of `year` and `weekday`, which may help capture different trends throughout the weekdays across years.
   - `f6 - f7` captures differences between working days and weather conditions (`workingday` and `weather`), potentially highlighting how different weather impacts working vs. non-working days.
   
3. **Transformations**:
   - `f2 sqrt` brings a transformation on `month`, which might reveal cyclical patterns more acutely. 
   - `f0 cos` applies a cosine transformation to `season`, allowing cyclical or periodic effects observed over seasons to be represented more effectively.
  
4. **Polynomial Feature**:
   - `f9 * f10` introduces another polynomial interaction term to capture any joint variation and joint effect of `humidity` and `windspeed`.

It seems like combining various transformation techniques (quantile transformations, scaling, trigonometric, logarithmic, and sigmoid) and interaction terms (products and sums) has been utilized to enhance predictive capability. I will propose a new feature set incorporating these ideas:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f0 cube, f1 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f11 sigmoid, f11 log, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f0 * f3, f8 * f9, f5 * f10, f3 / f11, f8 + f9, f8 quan_trans * f11, f9 quan_trans * f10, f2 log, f10 tanh, f6 * f7, f5 + f10, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f11 sin, f3 sigmoid * f4, f4 reciprocal, f2 / f5, f0 minmax_scaler * f1]

I've included:
- Additional interaction terms like f6 * f7 (weekday and weather conditions), which could capture seasonal effects.
- f5 + f10 (working day and wind speed), which might reflect busier cycling days.
- Square root transformations for f8, f9, and f10 to potentially capture non-linearity in their relationships.
- A reciprocal transformation for f4 (holiday), which contextualizes how rare holiday days might uniquely impact bike rental counts.
- Trigonometric transformation using sin on f11 (windspeed) to capture cyclical effects.
- Interaction using a sigmoid and reciprocal transformation with cube features.
- Consideration of feature scaling through minmax_scaler before interaction.

These transformations and interactions aim to uncover complex relationships and non-linear patterns that might exist within the data, potentially improving model predictions.

2026-01-13 15:08:01,196 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set for predicting the count of total rental bikes, we can incorporate various transformations and interactions among the existing features. The goal is to create features that might capture non-linear relationships, trend patterns, and other insights that could aid in prediction.

Based on the given examples, I'll generate a new feature set by considering diverse transformations and removing redundant or less informative transformations from previous sets:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f2 log ,f8 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f0 cube ,f1 cube ,f2 cube ,f3 cube ,f4 cube ,f5 cube ,f6 cube ,f7 cube ,f10 cube ,f11 sqrt ,f9 square ,f10 stand_scaler ,f11 reciprocal ,f2 f7 * ,f8 f9 + ]
```

### Explanation of New Additions:
1. **`f2 f7 *`**: Multiply month (f2) by day of the week (f7), which can capture any cyclic interaction between the month and weekdays.
   
2. **`f8 f9 +`**: Add temperature (f8) and humidity (f9) together as jointly they might have a compounded effect on the bike-sharing demand.

3. **`f10 stand_scaler`**: Apply standard scaling to windspeed (f10) to bring it into a standardized scale which could make the learning algorithm more efficient.

4. **`f11 reciprocal`**: Apply the reciprocal transformation to windspeed (f11) to handle non-linearities or outliers.

These new transformations are aimed at capturing interactions and scaling effects that could enhance the predictive power of the features.

In this feature set:
- We include basic transformations such as `sqrt`, `log`, and `cube` to model potential non-linearity.
- We incorporate normalization techniques like `quan_trans`, `minmax_scaler`, and `stand_scaler` to ensure features are on compatible scales and distributions.
- We use `reciprocal` and `tanh` transformations to capture inverse and bounded relationships.
- We add `sigmoid` transformation for capturing non-linear relationships in a bounded range.

Data Examples:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f2 log ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt] 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f0 cube ,f1 cube ,f2 cube ,f3 cube ,f4 cube ,f5 cube ,f6 cube ,f7 cube ,f10 cube ,f11 sqrt]

2026-01-13 15:09:39,028 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, the aim is to improve feature engineering for better predictive performance. The second set appears to involve various transformations, especially focusing on cube transformations, which can help capture non-linear patterns in the data. However, the inclusion of many cube terms can potentially lead to overfitting and increased computational complexity.

I'll propose a new feature set that balances non-linear transformations and ensures the features are appropriate for enhancing prediction while avoiding overfitting:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f2 log ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt, f8 * f9, f3 cos, f5 sin, f10 tanh, f11 log, f9 reciprocal, f4 minmax_scaler]
```

**Explanation:**
1. **f8 minmax_scaler** and **f4 minmax_scaler**: These scalars normalize the temperature and wind speed, which can help them fit well with gradient-based algorithms.

2. **f9 sqrt** and **f11 sqrt**: The square root transformation can help stabilize the variance.

3. **f2 log** and **f11 log**: The log transformation can be quite useful for skewed distributions and helps in handling outliers.

4. **f0 cube**, **f1 cube**, **f2 cube**, etc., from the previous set are removed due to potential overfitting. Instead, focus on targeted transformations.

5. **f8 \* f9**: Interaction term between temperature and feel_temp, capturing any synergistic effect.

6. **f3 cos**: Cosine transformation potentially adding a cyclic component for the hour of the day.

7. **f5 sin**: Sine transformation potentially exploiting cyclic patterns for weekdays.

8. **f10 tanh**: The hyperbolic tangent is useful for squashing the data within a range, which can help in certain ML algorithms.

9. **f9 reciprocal**: Adds non-linearity and can help capture inversely proportional relationships.

This set aims to capture more complex relationships beyond linear and polynomial by using trigonometric and logarithmic transformations, interactions, and scaling to build a more robust predictive model.
