2026-01-13 10:57:03,467 - INFO - llm output = To improve feature engineering in the context of predicting heart disease, the goal is to transform existing features into new ones that might capture more complex patterns and interactions. Based on the two given examples of feature transformations, here is a proposed better feature set:

```
[f0 stand_scaler ,f2 tanh ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 quant_trans ,f9 quant_trans ,f10 quant_trans ,f8 sqrt cube tanh ,f9 sqrt cube tanh ,f10 sqrt cube tanh ,f8 tanh tanh ,f9 tanh tanh ,f10 tanh tanh ,f4 log reciprocal ,f0 f2 cube * ,f8 f2 sqrt * ,f9 f2 sqrt * ,f10 f2 sqrt * ,f7 stand_scaler f2 sqrt * ,f7 stand_scaler sqrt tanh * ,f0 quant_trans sqrt tanh * ,f2 cube f9 tanh tanh * ,f2 cube f10 tanh tanh * ,f2 stand_scaler sigmoid cube * ,f8 tanh cube * ,f9 tanh cube * ,f10 tanh cube * ,f7 stand_scaler sigmoid cube * ,f7 square f9 cos * ,f7 square f10 cos * ,f2 cube f9 sqrt cube tanh tanh * ,f2 cube f10 sqrt cube tanh tanh * ,f8 square tanh * f9 tanh tanh * ,f10 square tanh * f8 tanh tanh * ,f8 square tanh * f9 sqrt cube tanh tanh * ,f9 square tanh * f2 sqrt cube *]
```

In this proposed feature set, operations like `quant_trans`, `stand_scaler`, and `cube` are used for their ability to handle outliers and scale the data, which might help algorithms learn better relationships. The addition of functions like `tanh`, `cos`, and `reciprocal` can capture nonlinear and cyclic relationships. Moreover, interaction terms created by multiplying and transforming different features together (e.g., `f8 sqrt cube tanh`) are designed to explore combinations that might have predictive power for heart disease.

2026-01-13 10:57:28,175 - INFO - llm output = Given the two examples of transformed feature sets, let's create a new feature set focusing on combining transformation techniques that might improve interpretability and predictive power.

We'll try to balance complexity with interpretability and predictive usefulness by choosing transformations that could capture non-linear relationships or normalize data without losing too much information.

Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f8, f9, f10, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f8 sqrt tanh, f9 sqrt tanh, f10 sqrt tanh, f8 cube tanh, f9 cube tanh, f10 cube tanh, f2 cube tanh, f8 sqrt cube, f9 sqrt cube, f2 sqrt cube, f10 sqrt cube, f2 sqrt cube tanh, f9 sqrt cube tanh, f2 sqrt tanh tanh, f9 sqrt tanh tanh, f2 cube tanh tanh, f10 cube tanh tanh]
```

This feature set maintains some of the key transformations from the previous examples (e.g., cube and tanh), while focusing on potentially impactful interactions between features in non-linear spaces. The transformations like `sqrt cube tanh` and `cube tanh tanh` are used to capture higher-level interactions and approximations that might be relevant for the heart disease prediction task.

2026-01-13 10:57:34,693 - INFO - llm output = Based on the previous two feature sets, here is an improved feature set combining some transformations from both examples while creating potentially more informative ones:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f0 f4 - cube, f9 f7 -, f10 f7 -, f12 f7 -, f3 f4 *, f7 f4 *, f4 reciprocal, f0 sqrt, f2 sin, f8 sin, f3 f0 - f4 - cube quan_trans, f3 f0 - f4 - cube quan_trans sin, f0 f4 - cube stand_scaler, f0 f4 - cube stand_scaler f7 - f0 - f4 - cube]
```

Here's a breakdown of the logic behind this feature set:
1. Retain the original features (`f0` to `f6`) as they directly represent important existing variables.
2. Include non-linear transformations (cube, reciprocal) and statistical scalers (quantile transformation, standard scaler) to account for non-linearities and varying distributions.
3. Incorporate interaction terms such as `f3 f4 *` and `f7 f4 *` to capture potential multiplicative influences between features that can indicate complex relationships.
4. Use trigonometric transformations (sin) on selected features for exploration of periodic or cyclic patterns.
5. Create features that combine multiple transformations to explore their joint influence in a potentially complex relationship, such as `f3 f0 - f4 - cube quan_trans` or `f0 f4 - cube stand_scaler`. 

These transformations should help in capturing both linear and non-linear relationships, potentially improving model accuracy and robustness.

2026-01-13 10:57:39,454 - INFO - llm output = Here's a new feature set improved from the two given feature sets, leveraging both mathematical transformations and scaling techniques for more nuanced transformations:

```
[f8 f7 - , f8 f3 - f10 f3 - * , f10 cos f2 cos - , f2 f10 cos cos - sigmoid, f10 f7 - minmax_scaler, f2 f10 cos cos sigmoid, f8 cos f2 - , f9 f3 - f10 f3 - * quan_trans, f10 f7 - minmax_scaler quan_trans, f8 cos cos cos f2 cos cos - , f9 f3 - f8 f7 - * , f10 cos cos cos f2 - sigmoid, f10 f3 - f8 f3 - * quan_trans, f2 cos cos cos f10 cos cos cos - sigmoid, f8 cos cos cos f2 - ]
```

Key Points:
1. The chosen features blend both feature differences/subtractions and trigonometric-based transformations (like `cos`), which can help capture cyclical patterns and interactions among features.
2. Scale transformations such as `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` improve the spread of certain extracted features.
3. The use of the `sigmoid` function introduces non-linearity, which helps in capturing non-linear relationships.

This feature set should offer a richer representation to potentially enhance the model's prediction capability regarding the presence of heart disease.

```

This feature set combines original variables with transformations using various mathematical operations like square root, sigmoid, reciprocal, tanh, and logarithm. By incorporating both additive and multiplicative interactions of features, we aim to improve the model's ability to capture underlying patterns related to heart disease prediction. Additionally, operations like `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `log` are applied to achieve a non-linear transformation, potentially enhancing the performance of machine learning algorithms in this context.

2026-01-13 10:57:53,507 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, we can enhance feature engineering by combining ideas from both sets and ensuring transformations are meaningful, potentially capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between feature pairs while trying to reduce noise and improve interpretability. The focus should be on maintaining diversity in transformations and combining operations that may highlight significant features for heart disease prediction.

Here's a suggestion for a better feature set:

```
[f2 f0 * sqrt ,f8 f7 sqrt * ,f2 f9 - cube ,f10 f1 - tanh ,f1 f9 * sigmoid ,f5 f10 * sigmoid ,f8 f1 * tanh ,f9 f7 sin - sigmoid ,f10 f3 quan_trans - tanh ,f7 sqrt f8 * ,f2 f0 * f2 f8 * sqrt * ,f8 f11 - cos ,f7 sin f9 - cube stand_scaler ,f7 sin f9 - cube cube ,f7 sin f9 - cube f1 f10 - cube * sigmoid ,f10 f10 * sigmoid ,f10 f3 sqrt * sigmoid ,f2 f8 * sqrt f2 f8 * sqrt *]
```

**Explanation:**
- We combine operations like `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `cos`, and `cube` on meaningful interactions and differences to capture potential non-linearities and hidden patterns.
- We use a mix of scalable transformations (e.g., `stand_scaler`, `cube`) on selected interactions to normalize and focus on significant variances.
- We include essential interactions (`f2`, `f0`, `f8`) and transformations (`sqrt`, `sigmoid`) to maintain predictive power and enhance feature diversity.

- Start by including potentially important base features as observed in both provided examples.
- Use subtraction operations extensively as demonstrated, which seems to be important.
- Apply non-linear transformations that might capture complex relationships in data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Given the two sets you provided, here is a new feature set that combines ideas from both, focusing on interaction terms and transformations that could capture complex relationships:

In this set:

- We retain some basic transformations like `f8`, as it might be useful alone.
- Interaction terms such as `f1 f9 *`, `f5 f10 *`, `f2 f0 *` capture interactions between different features.
- Transformations such as `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh` are used to capture non-linear relationships.
- Combining power operations and element-wise operations like multiplication along with non-linear transformations adds depth.
- Complex interactions like `f7 sin f9 - cube` and the introduction of transformation interactions `f1 f10 - tanh` could add meaningful features for the model.

This set reflects an attempt to harness interactions, feature scales, and non-linear transformations to improve prediction performance effectively.

The original features are f0 to f12. Hence, the operation will be applied across these derived features. The goal is to create transformations that capture interactions, non-linear relationships, or scale adjustments which might be useful for prediction, while considering insights from given examples.

Here's a refined feature set:

Explanation:
- `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are used on subtractions (such as `f3 f4 -` and `f7 f4 -`) to standardize the differences, potentially enhancing model performance on scaled data.
- `quan_trans` is included to capture potential non-linear transformations of the differences, which may reveal different distributions in the relationship.
- Applying `log`, `sqrt`, `cube`, and `sigmoid` on the same subtractions introduces non-linear transformations, potentially capturing unique relationships that a linear transformation might miss.

This set incorporates both scaling techniques and various mathematical transformations suggested for improving predictive power while balancing complexity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 10:58:36,413 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, it appears that they both aim to create additional features by calculating differences between some of the original features and a particular feature (f4 in the second set). This type of transformation can help capture relationships or patterns that are not immediately obvious from the original features.

In the second example, differences are calculated using f4 as a reference, which could be valuable if f4 is of particular interest or importance in predicting the target variable.

To improve the feature set, one could include more diverse transformations that could capture nonlinear relationships or interactions between variables. An enhanced feature set might look like this:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, 
 f0 f4 -, f1 f4 -, f2 f4 -, f5 f4 -, f6 f4 -, f8 f4 -, f9 f4 -, f10 f4 -, f11 f4 -, f12 f4 -, 
 f0 f1 *, f2 f3 *, f4 f5 *, f6 f7 *, 
 log f4, sqrt f3, square f7, cube f8, 
 stand_scaler f2, minmax_scaler f9]
```

In this enhanced feature set:
- Cross-product features like `f0 f1 *` capture interaction effects between `f0` and `f1`.
- Various transformations such as `log`, `sqrt`, `square`, and `cube` are used to model potential nonlinear relationships.
- Standard scaling and min-max scaling are applied to specific features to normalize their ranges, which can help linear models to perform better.

The derivation should consider complexity, potential significance, and variety of transformations that can capture non-linear relationships or interactions among the features. Here's an improved feature set:

### Breakdown:
1. Transformed several differences using `tanh`, `cos`, `sigmoid` to capture non-linear relationships.
2. Utilized a combination of `cube`, `sqrt`, and `sigmoid` to introduce non-linearity and interactions.
3. The mixture of basic mathematical operations (like * or -) aims to increase the number of interactive and complex features within the set.
4. Retained some components from the initial feature sets and extended upon them with additional transformations distributing complexity across the features.

This combination ensures varied non-linear transformations and interactions to potentially improve the downstream task of predicting heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 10:59:07,777 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, let's aim to enhance the discriminative power and complexity of the combinations, while ensuring a robust handling of potential non-linear relationships:

- Use non-linear transformations and combinations to capture more complex interactions.
- Apply scaling and transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `cube`, `stand_scaler` to provide better normalization and highlight patterns.
- Consider interactions among multiple features to generate a richer feature set.

Here's a proposed feature set:

``` 
[f8 f10 + ,f0 f10 * tanh ,f1 f9 * tanh ,f1 f10 * tanh ,f2 f8 * tanh ,f2 f9 * tanh ,f5 f10 * tanh ,f6 f2 * tanh ,f6 f8 * tanh ,f6 f9 * tanh ,f8 f10 * tanh ,f8 f7 sqrt * tanh ,f7 sqrt f8 * tanh ,f0 f9 * tanh ,f9 f8 * stand_scaler ,f9 f10 * stand_scaler ,f10 f0 * sigmoid ,f10 f10 * sigmoid ,f8 f3 sqrt * cube ,f9 f7 sqrt * cube ,f3 sqrt f9 * cube ,f10 f10 * cube ,f7 sin f8 * cube],
```

The key ideas here include leveraging non-linear transformations (like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cube`) alongside feature interactions to capture hidden aspects of the data and scaling to improve model convergence and performance. This should ideally increase the prediction capability for the presence of heart disease.

Explanation:
- This set uses a combination of feature interactions, basic arithmetic, logarithmic transformations, and duplication of potentially informative numeric features.
- Interactions between features such as f8 and f1, f3 and f4, f5 and f7 potentially capture non-linear relationships.
- Transformations like logarithms (f7 log f2 +) are used to diminish the impact of extreme-valued features and spread out the values of originally skewed distributions.
- Adding more complex interaction terms, such as multiplication (f3 f7 log *), helps capture non-linear effects between features.
- Finally, creating combinations (e.g., f3 f4 + and adding more transformations) in the context of medical or domain knowledge can add predictive value.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 10:59:20,184 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, the goal is to create a new set of transformed features that enhance the model's ability to predict the presence of heart disease. We should consider transformations that capture interactions and normalizations beneficial for prediction tasks.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, 
 f0 f4 -, 
 f4 f0 /,

 tanh f6,
 log f4, 
 f3 reciprocal, 
 f8 f10 +, 
 f11 f12 *,
 f1 f5 +,
 f0 f2 log *,
 sigmoid f3]
```

Explanation:
1. **Interaction Terms**: Interaction terms like `f0 f4 -` and `f1 f2 *` capture relationships between features.
2. **Normalization**: Applying `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` helps scale the features appropriately.
3. **Transformations**: Using transformations like `cube`, `square`, `tanh`, `log`, and `reciprocal` can help in capturing non-linear relationships and thus improve predictions.
4. **Additional Interaction and Scaling**: Combining log and multiplication like `f0 f2 log *` may provide significant insights into the relationships between features.

```plaintext

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Tanh Transformation:** Retained `f8 f1 * tanh` since it introduces non-linearity and can help capture complex relationships.
2. **Cosine Transformation:** Added `f7 sqrt f10 * cos`. Applying a trigonometric function like cosine can help capture oscillatory patterns that might relate to heart rate variability or pressure metrics on admission.
3. **Logarithmic Transformation and Addition:** Added `f3 f7 log +`. Logarithms can effectively model multiplicative factors and stabilize variance, especially for blood pressure and cholesterol measurements. Adding them can introduce an interaction term capturing joint effects.

1. Utilize interactions between features that are often relevant for heart disease predictions, like age and cholesterol.
2. Consider transforming features using various operations to capture nonlinear relationships.
3. Apply scaling or normalization to maintain numerical stability, particularly for features with higher variability.

Here's a new feature set:

```

In this new feature set:
- Interaction between `f3` (blood pressure) and `f7` (heart rate) can highlight how heart function might be affected under stress.
- `tanh f6` captures potential nonlinear effects of electrocardiographic results.
- `f0 f6 /` captures the interaction between age and electrocardiographic abnormalities, potentially highlighting age-related heart stress.
- `sigmoid f8` for transforming exercise-induced conditions into a bounded output.
- `f4 f11 +` assesses combined effects of cholesterol levels and exercise-related depression.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 10:59:50,118 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set and make it more useful for predicting the presence of heart disease, we can combine elements from the latter examples with additional transformations for enhanced feature representation. Here is a proposed better feature set:

```
[f2 f0 * f2 f8 * sqrt * , f8 f1 * tanh , f2 f8 * sqrt f2 f0 * sqrt * , f7 sqrt f8 * tanh , f10 f3 sqrt * sigmoid , f8 f10 * cosine , f1 f9 * logarithm , f0 f10 * sigmoid , f5 f10 * reciprocal , f2 f8 * f2 f0 * * , f10 f10 * cube , f8 f3 sqrt * tanh , f8 f7 sqrt * sigmoid , f9 f7 sqrt * cosine , f8 f1 * sigmoid , f2 f0 * sqrt f2 f0 * * ]
```

Explanation:
1. **f2 f0 * f2 f8 * sqrt *:** Retained from previous examples; combines features to potentially capture non-linear interactions.
2. **f8 f1 * tanh:** Added tanh transformation to capture non-linear effects in combination between these features.
3. **f2 f8 * sqrt f2 f0 * sqrt *:** Combines two sqrt-transformed products for interaction capture.
4. **f7 sqrt f8 * tanh:** Applies tanh to enhance non-linear interactions post sqrt.
5. **f10 f3 sqrt * sigmoid:** Sigmoid to scale transformed feature between (0,1).
6. **f8 f10 * cosine:** Alternative trig function applied for variation in non-linear interactions.
7. **f1 f9 * logarithm:** Logarithmic transformation for better scaling and feature representation.
8. **f0 f10 * sigmoid:** Applies sigmoid to feature combination, scaling interaction.
9. **f5 f10 * reciprocal:** Incorporates reciprocal transformation for diverse representation.
10. **f2 f8 * f2 f0 * *:** Retained powerful combination for interaction modeling.
11. **f10 f10 * cube:** Cube transformation for strong non-linear effect capture.
12. **f8 f3 sqrt * tanh:** Combines sqrt and tanh for refined feature interaction modeling.
13. **f8 f7 sqrt * sigmoid:** Injects sigmoid to remodel interaction behavior in reduced scale.
14. **f9 f7 sqrt * cosine:** Cosine function adds variation in feature representation.
15. **f8 f1 * sigmoid:** Sigmoid for smooth scaling between intense feature combination.
16. **f2 f0 * sqrt f2 f0 * *:** Maintained to capture key interactions and dynamics effectively.

This set integrates various transformations suitable to account for the complexity of the prediction task while evaluating different types of feature interactions and representations.

Incorporating these enhances the ability to capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships that might aid in better prediction of heart disease.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

- Basic transformations (e.g., subtraction from `f4`), which can be useful for recognizing differences relative to the `chol` feature.
- Multiplicative interactions, which may capture complex relationships.
- Non-linear transformations like logarithm, square root, and hyperbolic tangent to explore potential non-linear patterns in the data.

By exploring mathematical transformations and interactions between features, we aim to improve predictive power and reduce multicollinearity.

Key Enhancements:
1. **Added cube and reciprocal transformations**: These transformations capture nonlinear interactions and distributions that may better delineate between presence and absence of heart disease.

2. **Incorporated scaling methods (minmax_scaler)**: Normalizing complex transformed features enhances robustness to numerical variance and aids convergence in learning algorithms.

3. **Utilized log and sigmoid transformations**: Access the exponential relationships often present in medical datasets related to biological processes.

This new feature set combines linear, quadratic, exponential, and normalization techniques to improve feature richness and potentially boost model performance on the heart disease prediction task.

```

### Explanation:
- **Preserved Features:**
  - **Basic transformations & combinations:** These provide insights into feature interactions and distributions, such as `f1 f9 *`, `f8 f7 sqrt *`, and `f8 f3 sqrt *`.
  - **Use of activation functions:** `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `sqrt` help normalize the data, giving a potential edge in differentiating outliers or uncommon patterns.
- **Added Features:**
  - **Interaction Terms:** Terms like `f2 f8 * sqrt f2 f0 * *` capture interactions between different feature pairs in a non-linear way.
  - **Standardization & Scaling:** `f7 sin f9 - cube stand_scaler` applies multiple layers of transformation to better prepare features for models sensitive to scale. 
- **Removed Redundancies:** Certain repeated transformations or complex operations offering limited additional utility were not included to avoid overfitting due to model complexity.

[f0, f1, f2, f4, f7, f8, f9, f10, f0 f4 -, f1 f4 -, f2 f4 -, f5 f4 -, f8 f4 -, f3 f1 f4 - -, f3 f2 f4 - -, f3 f6 f4 - -, f3 f11 f4 - -, f3 f12 f4 - -, f7 f1 f4 - -, f7 f2 f4 - -, f7 f5 f4 - -, f7 f8 f4 - -, f7 f9 f4 - -, f7 f11 f4 - -, f7 f10 f4 - -, f1 f4 - sigmoid, f8 f4 - sigmoid, f3 f11 f4 - * cube, f0 f7 + sqrt, f10 f8 * log, f3 f9 tanh, f0 f1 / reciprocal] 

Explanation of additional transformations:
- **f10 f8 * log**: Introduces an interaction between two features (f10 and f8) and applies a logarithmic transformation, which is useful for capturing multiplicative relationships and non-linear effects.
- **f3 f9 tanh**: Applies a hyperbolic tangent function on the interaction between two features (f3 and f9), which can capture complex, smooth transitions and non-linear patterns that could relate to heart disease presence.
- **f0 f1 / reciprocal**: Combines f0 and f1 using division and then applies a reciprocal transformation, which might highlight inverse relationships or interactions between these features.

These suggested transformations aim to exploit potential nonlinear relationships and complex feature interactions that could improve the predictability of heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-13 11:01:14,243 - INFO - llm output = Given the two examples of new feature sets, our task is to create an improved set that provides better predictive power for the presence of heart disease. This should utilize the given operations and features effectively.

Here's the new feature set:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f3 f4 +, f7 f4 +, f2 sqrt, f6 cube, f9 f11 /, f2 log, f9 f4 * f8 +, f5 f7 minmax_scaler, f7 f10 f8 * -]

Explanation:

1. **f2 sqrt**: Square root transformation can help in reducing skewness, especially for features with a wide range of values.

2. **f6 cube**: Cubing can introduce non-linearity that might capture interactions not directly apparent from linear transformations.

3. **f9 f11 /**: Interaction between oldpeak (f9) and thal (f11) could unveil relational insights, hence their division.

4. **f2 log**: Log transformation is another way to handle skewness, particularly effective when dealing with right-skewed distributions.

5. **f9 f4 * f8 +**: This interaction combines oldpeak (f9) and chol (f4) with thalach (f8), potentially capturing cardiovascular risks in relation to cholesterol levels and exercise-induced changes.

6. **f5 f7 minmax_scaler**: Scaling fbs (f5) and thalach (f7) ensures features are within comparable ranges; Min-max scaling preserves relationships and helps normalize disparities among different features.

7. **f7 f10 f8 * -**: Interaction between thalach (f7), exang (f10), and f8 helps in understanding the exercise impact on heart rate, potentially crucial for heart disease predictions.

By using a combination of feature combinations, transformations, and interactions, the derived feature set aims to better capture non-linear relationships and interactions among original features that are significant to heart disease prediction.
