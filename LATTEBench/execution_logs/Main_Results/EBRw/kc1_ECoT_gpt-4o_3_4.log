you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Selection**: Combined important features from both examples (e.g., `f0`, `f5`, `f7`, `f10`, etc.).
2. **Transformation Type Diversity**: Incorporated various transformation methods: `tanh`, `sqrt`, `stand_scaler` to capture different aspects of the underlying data.
3. **Composite Features**: Enhanced composite features using combinations like `f11 f5 * tanh sqrt` to capture interactions between features.
4. **Scaling**: Used `stand_scaler` to normalize feature ranges, improving model performance and stability.
5. **Outcome**: A diverse new feature list aiming to enhance predictive capability by considering nonlinear interactions and normalizing effects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:02:50,643 - INFO - llm output = Building upon the two provided feature sets, I'll suggest a new feature set that aims to leverage transformations and combinations to potentially enhance the predictive power. Here’s the improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f3 ,f4 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f11 ,f12 ,f14 ,f20 ,f0 quan_trans ,f1 quan_trans ,f3 quan_trans ,f6 quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans ,f12 quan_trans ,f14 quan_trans ,f16 quan_trans ,f18 quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans ,f9 cos quan_trans ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt quan_trans ,f2 square ,f5 cos quan_trans ,f9 cube quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans log ,f8 quan_trans reciprocal ,f9 stand_scaler cos ,f5 minmax_scaler quan_trans cube ,f9 cube reciprocal cos ,f9 cos stand_scaler]
```

Explanation:

1. **Transformation Variety**: The new feature set incorporates a mix of transformations such as square, cube, reciprocal, and combinations of transformations (e.g., `cos quan_trans`). These help in capturing non-linear relationships.
   
2. **Complex Features**: Used second order transformations like `quan_trans quan_trans`, which can help in fine scaling and modifications during quantile transformations for non-normal distributions.

3. **Statistical Scaling**: Stand_scaler was used in combination with `cos` to ensure that features are adjusted for mean and variance, which may help models understand the data better in standardized form.

4. **Advanced Feature Selection**: Retained more advanced transformations like those involving `cos` and `cube` to capture the periodic or cyclic relationships and polynomial intricacies that can relate to defect prediction.

5. **Feature Interaction**: Enhanced interaction between features (like `f5 minmax_scaler quan_trans cube`) can reveal insights from different scaling and transformation techniques interplaying, potentially leading to better predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 12:03:08,055 - INFO - llm output = To come up with a better feature set by integrating ideas from the given examples, we can focus on:

1. Utilizing transformations that can capture non-linear relationships, such as squares and trigonometric functions.
2. Implementing data normalization and transformation techniques effectively like `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and `sigmoid`.
3. Experimenting with combinations of features through simple arithmetic operations to observe interactions.

Let's design a feature set integrating these principles:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f9, f10, f11, f14, f15, 
 f0 square, f3 square, f6 square, f9 square, f14 square, f16 square,

 f5 sin, f4 sin, f18 sin, 
 f7 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, 
 f2 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f19 quan_trans, f17 quan_trans, 
 f4 sqrt, f14 sqrt, f5 sqrt,

 f0 f6 quan_trans +, f0 f19 quan_trans +, 
 f0 f10 sigmoid +, f0 f12 sigmoid +
 f19 f7 f11 +, 
 f7 f5 f19 * tanh]
```

Here, I blend a mixture of squaring, scaling, nonlinear transformations (e.g., `tanh`, `sigmoid`), arithmetic combinations, and simple derivatives from the original dataset to capture complex relationships and interactions among features that might be useful for defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Key improvements:

1. Incorporation of trigonometric transformations with existing features to possibly capture periodic patterns.
2. Additional multiplication and summation operations to help uncover interaction effects between features.
3. Removal of repetitive features that didn't add unique value.
4. Maintaining complex feature transformations for non-linear effects with increased depth.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:03:30,439 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature engineering examples, we can create a new feature set that further transforms the features for improved predictions. Here is a possible transformation:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f3 ,f6 ,f7 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f3 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f7 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f10 tanh ,f11 tanh ,f12 tanh ,f13 tanh ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f16 minmax_scaler ,f17 minmax_scaler ,f20 minmax_scaler ,f9 log ,f11 log ,f0 cube ,f6 cube ,f7 cube ,f9 cube ,f10 cube ,f12 cube ,f19 cube ,f20 cube ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f7 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f0 tanh sqrt ,f1 tanh sqrt ,f3 tanh sqrt ,f6 tanh sqrt ,f7 tanh sqrt ,f9 tanh sqrt ,f10 tanh sqrt ,f11 tanh sqrt ,f12 tanh sqrt ,f13 tanh sqrt ,f5 log reciprocal ,f4 log cube minmax_scaler ]
```

This transformation includes:
- Logarithmic scaling to reduce the impact of large values and spread out smaller values for features like `f9` and `f11`.
- `tanh` transformation applied after `sqrt` transform to reduce non-linear effects in features with high variance.
- Cube transformation to capture interactions in features that exhibit multiplicative effects.
- Combination of `log`, `cube`, and `minmax_scaler` to normalize and further transform a feature for better representativeness.
  
These transformations aim to capture non-linear relationships, reduce the effect of extreme values, and boost the discriminative power of the features in predicting software defects.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f14 ,f20 ,f0 quan_trans ,f1 quan_trans ,f4 quan_trans ,f6 quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f12 quan_trans ,f14 quan_trans ,f16 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans ,f9 cos quan_trans ,f9 cube ,f5 cos quan_trans quan_trans ,f9 cos quan_trans quan_trans ,f0 quan_trans quan_trans ,f3 quan_trans quan_trans ,f4 quan_trans quan_trans ,f4 cos quan_trans ,f5 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f6 quan_trans quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans quan_trans ,f9 cube quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans quan_trans ,f16 quan_trans quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans quan_trans ,f18 quan_trans quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans quan_trans ,f9 stand_scaler ,f9 cos]

2026-01-12 12:03:43,985 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, the latter set has retained all the original features (f0, f1, ... f20) and performed additional transformations using trigonometric functions on a couple of features. To improve upon both examples and create a more comprehensive feature set, we should consider incorporating both the raw features and a diverse set of transformations that have shown success in previous studies for defect prediction. We'll include diverse transformations to capture different functional relationships, including scaling, non-linear transformations, and statistical normalization.

Here is a proposed improved feature set, combining the strengths of the given examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,   f0 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f1 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f0 log, f1 log, f8 log, f10 log, f14 log, f7 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f3 sin, f5 cos, f12 tanh,   f9 cube, f9 reciprocal, f4 sigmoid,   f0 f1 *, f2 f3 +, f7 f8 -, f9 f10 /]
```

This new feature set includes the following:

1. **Original Features**: All raw features (f0 to f20) to maintain original data dimensions.
2. **Scaling**: Min-max scaling (`minmax_scaler`) and standard scaling (`stand_scaler`) are applied to capture relative feature magnitudes and variability.
3. **Quantile Transformation**: Used on selected features (f1, f4, f6, f9) to address non-normal distributions.
4. **Log Transformation**: Applied to positively skewed features (f0, f1, f8, f10, f14) to stabilize variance and normalize.
5. **Square Root and Other Mathematical Transformations**: Applied (e.g., `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `cube`, `reciprocal`, `sigmoid`) to capture non-linear relationships and periodic patterns.
6. **Feature Combinations**: Interactions between features can capture more complex relationships (e.g., `f0 * f1`, `f2 + f3`, `f7 - f8`, `f9 / f10`).

This diverse set of transformations and interactions offers a comprehensive way to capture complex patterns that could improve predictive performance.

```

**Explanation of Additions:**

1. **f1 stand_scaler tanh**: Applying standard scaling followed by hyperbolic tangent can help normalize and non-linearly transform `f1`, often useful for neural networks.

2. **f10 reciprocal**: Reciprocal can highlight the inverse relationship, potentially adding signal to detect unique patterns in `f10`.

3. **f5 square**: Squaring `f5` captures the nonlinear interactions involving the Halstead 'volume' metric, which may be influential in defect prediction.

4. **f20 log**: Applying logarithm to a feature can often reduce skew and handle heavy-tailed distributions, improving model sensitivity for `f20`. 

These operations are aimed at capturing intricate relationships through nonlinear transformations, which might improve the predictive power for software defect identification.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this improved set:

- I applied `square` on `f6` and `f8` to capture quadratic relationships.
- I applied `cube` on `f18` and `f19` to capture cubic relationships.
- I introduced `sigmoid` transformations on `f1` and `f7` to explore the sigmoid curve behavior in feature space.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Combining the operations from the given examples with some additional transformations can enhance the feature set. Below is a feature set that builds on the previous examples and incorporates additional derived features to potentially improve the prediction model:

```

```

### Explanation:
- **Original Features**: Include all the original features to maintain the base data integrity.
- **Squared Terms**: `f5 square`, `f2 square` captures potential quadratic relationships.
- **Reciprocal**: `f1 reciprocal`, `f15 reciprocal` to capture inverse relationships.
- **Log Transformation**: `f9 log`, `f0 log` captures potential multiplicative effects on scale.
- **Non-linear Transformations**:
  - `f4 tanh`, `f8 quan_trans`, `f12 sin`, `f18 cos` capture cyclical patterns or non-linear interactions.
  - `f7 minmax_scaler` normalizes for comparison.
- **Square Root and Cube**: `f3 sqrt`, `f5 sqrt`, `f10 cube` for capturing intermediate rates of change.
- **Combinations & Interactions**:
  - `f0 f5 *`, `f6 f7 *`, `f11 f5 *` capture the interaction effects between features which might be predictive.

This feature set attempts to balance retaining the useful information in the raw data while also transforming it to expose underlying patterns for better defect prediction.

```

In this feature set:

- I retained most base features as they seem important.
- Applied various scaling techniques like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`.
- Added logarithmic and reciprocal transformations, which can help stabilize variance and make the model more robust.
- Introduced interactions and combined transformations such as `f9 f20 * sqrt` and `f3 f17 - sqrt`.
- Applied non-linear transformations such as `sin`, `cosine`, `tanh` to add non-linearity.

This approach enhances the feature space by considering potential interactions and transformations that may capture complex relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:04:29,782 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we can focus on including a combination of original, transformed, and interaction features. Additionally, more complex transformations or interactions, if they provide higher predictive power, should be considered. I'll incorporate some of these concepts to propose an enhanced feature set:

```markdown
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 cos, f9 square, f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f12 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, f16 quan_trans, f17 quan_trans, f18 quan_trans, f19 quan_trans, f20 quan_trans, f9 cos quan_trans, f9 square quan_trans, f4 sin, f11 cos, f11 f18 -, f10 f5 /, f3 f2 * quan_trans, f0 f1 f7 + / sqrt, f6 log]
```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Feature Transformations**: Starting from the foundational transformations like `quan_trans`, `cos`, `square`, and `sin` that have been shown useful.
- **Interaction Features**: Including combinations like `f11 f18 -`, `f3 f2 *` to capture interactions that might be relevant.
- **Complex Transformations**:
  - `f10 f5 /`: Creating a derived feature by performing division, which could highlight ratio-based importance.
  - `f3 f2 * quan_trans`: An interaction feature followed by a transformation to capture non-linear relationships.
  - `f0 f1 f7 + / sqrt`: Combining and scaling features before applying a more complex transformation.
- **Logarithmic Transformation**: Applying `log` to `f6` to compress presumably skewed data, which could expose underlying trends more clearly.

By using a mix of these strategies, the expectation is to enhance predictive performance by uncovering hidden patterns and relationships in the data.

Here's an improved feature set that combines some transformations and interactions:

In this feature set:
1. Interactions like `f0 f5 *` and `f9 f18 *` might capture multiplicative relationships between features.
2. The addition operation `f11 f4 square +` could help combine non-linear effects usefully.
3. Division operation `f6 f7 tanh /` explores ratios influenced by hyperbolic tangent.
4. The cube operation `f19 f11 cube` increases the non-linear transformations.
5. The multiplication of squares `f4 f1 square *` might capture joint quadratic relationships.
6. The reciprocal interaction `f0 f6 reciprocal *` offers a way to explore inverse relationships.

These transformations and interactions aim to extract more complex patterns that could be predictive while being mindful of the risk of overfitting.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:04:46,987 - INFO - llm output = To improve the existing feature sets based on feature transformation operations, let's aim to introduce additional transformations that could capture non-linear relationships or interactions better. The goal is to generate more informative features while leveraging the existing transformations.

Here's a new feature set example:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f17 quan_trans, f18 quan_trans, f19 quan_trans, f20 quan_trans, f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f12 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f0 quan_trans sqrt, f1 quan_trans sqrt, f4 quan_trans sqrt, f6 quan_trans sqrt, f7 quan_trans sqrt, f8 quan_trans sqrt, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f0 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f9 minmax_scaler quan_trans sqrt, f11 log, f12 log, f14 log, f9 cube, f6 cube, f5 sigmoid, f8 tanh quan_trans]

### Improvements:
1. **Tanh and Sigmoid** transformations are being utilized on crucial features (e.g., `f9`, `f8`) which can help capture non-linearity especially when these features are related to software complexity where saturation and smooth transitions matter.
2. **Logarithmic** transformations are being applied to features (e.g., `f11`, `f12`, `f14`) potentially characterized by skewness or wide ranges, helping to scale them down and stabilize variances.
3. **Cube and Reciprocal** transformations for `f9` and `f6` are introduced to capture potential cubic relationships and reciprocal effects, which can assist in identifying multiplicative inverses or more nuanced interactions in complexity calculations.
4. Continued leveraging of **Quantile-based transformations** to make features more robust to outliers and preserve distributional properties, in combination with **Sqrt** transformations for variance reduction.

This new feature transformation captures a broader set of mathematical operations aimed at making the data more interpretable and predictive by harnessing non-linear relationships and statistical properties beneficial for defect prediction.

```

### Explanations:
1. **Feature Interactions**: We created new features by multiplying and adding certain features together. For example, `f0 f5 *` and `f6 f7 * sqrt`, capturing interactions between various features.

2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Introduced new dimensions such as `f4 f8 log`, using the logarithm to handle cases with exponential growth, and `f11 f12 / cube`, to capture inverse cube relationships.

3. **Scaling and Normalizing**: Continued to employ techniques like standard scaling and quantile transformation on new derived features, e.g., `f7 f8 + f15 stand_scaler *`, to ensure that features on different scales don't negatively affect the model's learning.

4.**Complex Combinations**: Added combinations like `f18 f19 + sqrt` to capture potential non-linear relationships in data that are not directly captured by the linear relationships. 

This improved set builds upon the given examples, striving to uncover deeper insights and patterns within the data through advanced feature engineering techniques.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this improved feature set:

- I retained the best transformations from the previous examples.
- Added `tanh` and `sigmoid` transformations to capture nonlinearities that might be useful for predicting software defects.
- Combined transformations such as `sqrt`, `quan_trans`, and `sigmoid` to ensure capturing different aspects of feature scaling and transformation.
- Focused on features `f0`, `f6`, `f7`, and `f8` which seem to be frequently transformed in previous setups.

2026-01-12 12:05:07,821 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! Based on the feature sets provided, let's create a new, improved feature set:

1. Include the original and several transformed features:
   - Retain a good selection of raw features and their transformations.
   - Ensure that effective transformations from the previous examples are included and built upon.

2. Balance complexity and informativeness:
   - Maintain diverse transformations to capture complex patterns.
   - Avoid excessive complexity that doesn't provide additional insight.

3. Utilize meaningful transformations:
   - For instance, use scaling and non-linear transformations on features likely to benefit from these, based on variance and distribution.

Here is the suggested new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 stand_scaler ,f9 quan_trans ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f7 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f13 sqrt ,f14 sqrt ,f15 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f9 f9 - sqrt ,f9 quan_trans sqrt ,f9 sigmoid ,f11 sqrt ,f4 square ,f5 log ,f7 cube ,f3 f4 * sqrt]
```

**Explanation:**
- Retained essential features and their sqrt transformations, ensuring non-linear relationships are captured.
- Included log and cube transformations for specific features (e.g., `f5 log`, `f7 cube`) to handle skewness and highlight polynomial interactions.
- Incorporated additional transformations from example 2 (`f3 f4 * sqrt`), capturing interactions between features.
- Emphasized scalable transformations (e.g., `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`) to harmonize feature scales and distributions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

This feature set includes:

- Interaction terms such as division and multiplication between original features (e.g., `f0 f1 /`, `f4 f5 *`), capturing relative magnitudes and joint effects.
- Advanced transformations using logarithm, cube, and reciprocal handling nonlinear relationships (`f8 log`, `f19 cube`, `f20 reciprocal`).
- Nonlinear scaling and transformation methods like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `stand_scaler` for potentially improving model robustness and handling skewed data.
- Square root transformations of various new interaction features to ensure capturing square and root relations (`f9 f10 * sqrt`).

These transformations aim to leverage complex interactions and scaling operations to extract more meaningful patterns from the data for defect prediction.

2026-01-12 12:05:33,595 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and operations used, the goal is to improve the prediction quality by using a combination of feature transformations that capture more meaningful information or dynamics in the data.

The first feature set employs quantile transformation and standard scaler on the ninth feature (f9), which might aid in normalizing and standardizing the data. It also uses various mathematical transformations like square root, square, and sigmoid which potentially improve the modeling of non-linear relationships in the data. 

The second feature set utilizes a min-max scaler transformation on the fifth feature (f5), which may help in scaling this particular feature, along with a sigmoid transformation on f9.

Considering these approaches and aiming for a balance between normalization/shaping and capturing non-linear relationships, here is a proposed improvement on the feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f5 minmax_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f9 sigmoid, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f9 reciprocal, f10 sqrt, f2 cube]
```

This feature set updates the previous transformation to include both normalization approaches on different features (f5 and f9), providing a mix of transformations to capture both distribution scaling and potential non-linear dynamics. It also incorporates reciprocal and cube transformations for variance, leveraging mathematical operations to capture complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 12:05:40,512 - INFO - llm output = Designing a better feature set entails creating new transformations of the original features that can capture more complex patterns or interactions among them. By using a combination of mathematical operations and scaling, we can potentially enhance the prediction model's performance. Given your examples, I'll construct a new feature set that leverages deeper transformations and combinations.

Here's the new feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:
- **Square Transformations**: Features like `f1`, `f2`, `f6`, `f7`, `f9`, `f11`, `f12`, and `f18` are squared to capture any non-linear effects they might have on the target variable.
- **Reciprocal and Log Transformations**: These are applied to reduce the distribution skew for features such as `f0`, `f3`, and `f10`, and refine sensitivity for features `f8`, `f12`, and `f19`.
- **Sine and Sigmoid**: Applied on `f2` and `f6` respectively, providing beneficial periodic transformations and non-linear squashing.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Used on `f9` and `f15` to normalize these features.
- **Hyperbolic Tangent and Quantile Transformation**: Applied on `f11` and `f13` for smooth and non-linear transformations.
- **Square Root and Multiplicative Interaction**: Utilizing square roots (`f17`) and multiplication (`f17 * f6`) help capture interaction effects.
- **Additive and Subtractive Interactions**: Operations `f0 + f1` and `f0 - f1` capture two-way variable interactions, useful for capturing simple linear relationships.

These transformations and interactions could reveal insights and patterns within the data that weren't readily apparent from the raw features.

The latter example employs a comprehensive range of transformations, including squares, reciprocals, scalers, and trigonometric functions, which can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively. Let's construct a new, improved feature set by combining these techniques:

In this new feature set:
- I included the base features (`f0` to `f20`).
- Maintained squares of several base features to capture polynomial relationships.
- Retained reciprocal transformations for non-linear scaling.
- Incorporated trigonometric (`sin`) and hyperbolic (`tanh`) transformations for non-linear pattern recognition.
- Kept `log` transformations which are particularly useful when dealing with multiplicative relationships.
- Introduced `cube` transformation to explore cubic relationships, providing another layer of non-linearity.
- Added a multiplicative combination of summed features (`f0 f1 f5 + *`) to explore interactions between features which can be significant predictors of defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:05:56,109 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and operations, we need to enhance the feature set to potentially improve the prediction task by leveraging additional feature transformations. Here's a new feature set example that combines the transformations from the latter example and introduces a few more operations to enrich the feature space:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 f9 - ,f9 stand_scaler ,f9 quan_trans ,f4 cube ,f5 sqrt ,f6 log ,f7 reciprocal ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f19 tanh ,f20 sigmoid]
```

Explanation:
1. `f4 cube`: Cubing the feature `f4`, which represents Halstead total operators + operands, could highlight exponential growth patterns associated with complexity and defects.
2. `f5 sqrt`: Square root transformation on feature `f5` reduces skewness and could make volume measures more interpretable.
3. `f6 log`: Log transformation can handle wide ranges and make program length measurements more linear.
4. `f7 reciprocal`: This transformation is helpful for difficulty measures that might be inversely related to defect occurrence.
5. `f8 minmax_scaler`: Normalizing intelligence measures between 0 and 1 can standardize effects across modules.
6. `f19 tanh`: Applying tanh to branch count can smooth extreme values and edge cases.
7. `f20 sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation on `f20` (flow graph) could highlight significant structural changes impacting defect likelihood.

These transformations all aim to provide additional insights into predictive patterns for software defects by summarizing key structural and complexity measures in various scales and forms.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, I've added transformations like multiplying and adding combinations of features, applying cube, logarithm, tanh, and reciprocal transformations, which could help capture nonlinear relationships and interactions in the data. These transformations aim to provide more discriminative features that could enhance the defect prediction outcomes.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The feature set could combine scaling, transformation, and arithmetic operations, especially focusing on leveraging interactions between features and nonlinear transformations. Here's a more refined feature set:

```

In this set:
- We incorporate basic arithmetic interactions between features, creating new composite features such as `f0 f1 + reciprocal`.
- Apply logarithmic and square root transformations to products of features, such as `f2 f3 * log` and `f4 f5 * sqrt`, to introduce non-linearity.
- Utilize trigonometric functions (tanh and cos) for individual and combined features, such as `f6 tanh` and `f7 f8 * cos`, potentially useful for pattern detection in periodic data.
- Use scaling techniques (quantile transformation, min-max scaling) for composite features like `f13 f14 * minmax_scaler`, which can help align the data for better model compatibility.
- Implement complex transformations like cubic and squared adjustments for features, `f17 cube` and `f18 square`, to allow adjustments that can capture non-linear relationships.
- Integrate feature interactions followed by transformations, `f19 f20 * sqrt`, potentially capturing synergies between features that single transformations might miss.

This approach aims for a comprehensive exploration of interactions and diverse transformations to potentially enhance prediction quality.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

- Combined transformations such as `minmax_scaler` followed by `quan_trans` to standardize and reshape feature distributions.
- Nonlinear transformations such as `tanh`, `log`, and `reciprocal` applied after scaling, enhancing feature expressiveness.
- Multi-step transformations focusing on compound transformations that might extract even more useful patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation of additions:

- `f8 cube`: Cubing the volume (or whichever feature `f8` represents) to capture extreme variability, which might help in distinguishing between modules with and without defects.
- `f5 sqrt`: Taking the square root of the program length (or whichever feature `f5` represents) could help in normalizing the scale and reduce skewness in the data.
- `f7 f6 +`: Summing up different features (here, possibly 'difficulty' and 'intelligence') to create a new composite feature that might correlate differently with defects.
- `f3 f2 * sqrt`: Multiplying two features (essential and cyclomatic complexity) and then taking the square root could help capture non-linear relationships between these complexities and defects.

2026-01-12 12:06:41,774 - INFO - llm output = To improve the predictions, we'll focus on transforming the features to create a set that captures more nuanced relationships. Here's a new feature set proposal that leverages transformations to uncover potential patterns that might be more indicative of defect presence:

- [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f5 sqrt, f9 sigmoid, f4 reciprocal, f11 tanh, f7 cube, f10 log, f8 minmax_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f3 sin, f9 f5 /, f6 f8 *, f7 f10 +, f2 f4 -, f12 f3 f1 *, f13 sin quan_trans, f14 cos stand_scaler, f15 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f16 log sqrt, f17 cube reciprocal, f18 sigmoid sqrt, f19 tanh cube, f20 reciprocal minmax_scaler]

In this proposal:
- Combining features (e.g., `f6 f8 *` and `f12 f3 f1 *`) can help capture interactions between different aspects of the data.
- Applying functions like `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `cube`, `sqrt`, and `reciprocal` to combinations or transformations aids in extracting potentially non-linear relationships or scale differences.
- Utilizing `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and other transformations tailors distributions towards either normalization or capturing specific behavioral responses within data.

This mix of transformations aims to provide a richer, more complex representation of features that could lead to enhanced predictive capability by reflecting hidden patterns linked to software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's the transformed feature set:

```

```

Features transformation approach here:
1. Multiplication (`f5 f11 *`): combines two features to potentially highlight interactions.
2. Trigonometric transformation (`f9 sin`, `f17 f18 cos`): captures cyclical patterns.
3. Ratio (`f6 f13 /`): compares two features, capturing proportionality.
4. Reciprocal (`f3 f10 reciprocal`): transforms features with a diminishing returns pattern.
5. Square root (`f14 sqrt`): reduces large values and enhances smaller ones.
6. Hyperbolic tangent (`f2 f19 tanh`): provides smoothing and bounds transformations.
7. Standard scaling (`f5 f15 stand_scaler`): normalizes data to enhance model learning.
8. Cube transformation (`f12 f8 cube`): accentuates variability and feature interaction.
9. Logarithmic transformation (`f1 f16 log`): compresses the range, useful for skewed distributions.

This set combines basic normalization and complex mathematical transformations to potentially improve model learning and defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:06:52,875 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, let's construct a new feature set that incorporates useful transformations and additional engineered features for improved predictions in the given defect prediction task:

1. Both original feature sets include the raw features (f0 through f20), which should be retained as they represent the base information.
2. From the first feature set, the minmax_scaler transformation on f5 can help with normalization and is good to include for certain models.
3. The sigmoid transformation on f9 from the first feature set can be useful to bring the feature values within a bound range of (0, 1).
4. From the second feature set, the difference between f9 and itself (f9 f9 -) effectively results in zero, which isn't useful, but it indicates an intent to explore interactions or differences, which can be useful if applied to other features.
5. We can experiment with combining features through simple arithmetic operations to capture potential interactions between features.

Here's the proposed new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f9 sigmoid ,f3 f8 + ,f1 f9 * ,f4 reciprocal]
```

### Explanation:
- **f5 minmax_scaler**: Normalization can help models where scale matters.
- **f9 sigmoid**: Transformation for any potential non-linear modeling.
- **f3 f8 +**: Example of a simple interaction term capturing potential cumulative impact from essential complexity and Halstead intelligence.
- **f1 f9 \***: Interaction capturing the relationship between McCabe's cyclomatic complexity and Halstead's effort.
- **f4 reciprocal**: A transformation that might help capture any non-linear effects with respect to design complexity.

By using these transformations and interactions, we aim to capture both underlying and emerging patterns that may influence software defect predictions.
