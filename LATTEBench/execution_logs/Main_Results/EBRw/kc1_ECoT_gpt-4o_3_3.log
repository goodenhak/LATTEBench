you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's a new feature set that builds upon the examples given:

```

```

### Explanation:
1. **Log Transformation:** Helps in reducing the skewness of the features, making them closer to a normal distribution, which is beneficial for many machine learning models.
   
2. **Sqrt Transformation:** Features are less extreme and potentially less skewed, which helps if the distribution of errors in the model is a concern.

3. **Standardization:** The `f9 stand_scaler` transformation converts features to a standard scale (mean = 0, stddev = 1), improving model performance due to better convergence properties.

4. **Reciprocal Transformation:** Helps in handling large ranges in data, which is particularly useful when some feature values might be very large.

5. **Feature Interaction:** 
   - Multiplying features like `f7 f8 *` and `f9 f10 *` can capture interactions between variables that are not obvious, leading to better patterns for prediction.
   - Adding features like `f6 f10 +` can capture cumulative effects.

6. **Additional Transformations:** Using these basic operations, we interact features before applying certain transformations like square root, which can capture non-linearities.

This approach tries to balance transforming variables for normality, creating interactions, and simplifying model complexity for better predication of software defects.

2026-01-12 11:56:29,826 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that leverages the transformations from both provided examples, we will focus on combining operations that encapsulate essential feature interactions while reducing complexity. Here's a proposed feature set:

```

Here's the rationale behind the proposed feature set:
- Retain core features and some higher-order interactions such as multiplication which capture multiplicative relationships.
- Use square transformations to enhance the visibility of non-linear relationships.
- Incorporate sinusoidal transformations for cyclic pattern capturing.
- Apply reciprocal transformations for feature inversion and balance
- Include quantile transformation and square root quantile transformation to deal with skewness.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

```
### Changes and Additions:
1. **Interaction Terms:**
   - `f4 f9 *`: This new interaction captures the multiplication between features that might not be directly correlated but could provide insights into their interaction.
   - `f7 f10 +`: This addition provides a new perspective by summing these features, capturing potential co-relations.
  
2. **Complex Transformation:**
   - `f6 f9 + cube`: Combining and cubing these features can capture high-order interactions and complex patterns.

3. **Non-linear Transformation:**
   - `f11 log f5 *`: Log transformation of feature 11 and its product with feature 5 to mitigate skewness and multicollinearity.

4. **Non-linear transformation with activation functions:**
   - `f9 tanh`: Apply a hyperbolic tangent to feature 9 to normalize and capture saturation effects. 

These transformations should help in exploring and adding a richer set of interactions to the dataset, potentially leading to better prediction performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

In this set, I have maintained the comprehensive reciprocal transformations from the second set, while adding new transformations like the logarithm, tangent, and cube for additional features. These transformations can help in capturing nonlinear relationships and interactions between features, which could potentially lead to improved predictive performance. Additionally, some combined transformations using basic arithmetic operations and scaling are included to add more diverse interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

Here's a proposed feature set based on the provided examples:

```
[f0, f1, f3, f5, f8, f9, f9 stand_scaler, f4 square, f9 square, f6 square, f8 cube, f9 stand_scaler reciprocal, f16 sigmoid, f9 stand_scaler sin, f17 square square sin, f9 square sigmoid, f6 square square sin, f8 square sigmoid sin, f9 stand_scaler reciprocal sin, f8 minmax_scaler reciprocal sin, f9 square reciprocal sigmoid, f9 stand_scaler square sin, f11 sin sigmoid sin, f8 square square sigmoid sin]
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Direct Features**: Retain base features like `f0`, `f1`, `f3`, `f5`, `f8`, and `f9` to maintain access to core information.
2. **Standard Scaled Feature**: Use `f9 stand_scaler` to address scaling and normalization.
3. **Square and Cube**: Apply square and cube transformations for non-linearity — e.g., `f4 square`, `f9 square`, `f6 square`, `f8 cube`.
4. **Reciprocal and Sigmoid**: Utilize reciprocal and sigmoid transformations to capture inverses and probabilistic interpretations — e.g., `f9 stand_scaler reciprocal`, `f16 sigmoid`.
5. **Trigonometric and Composite Features**: Incorporate complex transformations combining sigmoid and sinusoidal functions — e.g., `f9 stand_scaler sin`, `f17 square square sin`, `f6 square square sin`, `f8 square sigmoid sin`, `f9 stand_scaler reciprocal sin`, `f8 minmax_scaler reciprocal sin`.
6. **Composite Transforms**: Combine different transformations to explore complex interactions and feature engineering — e.g., `f11 sin sigmoid sin`, `f8 square square sigmoid sin`.

This feature set attempts to balance maintaining original features, common scaling and polynomial transformations, and more complex feature engineering techniques that might better capture the nuances in the data for software defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:57:06,375 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new and better feature set, we'll combine useful transformations from the previous examples and incorporate a few additional transformations that may capture important patterns for the defect prediction task. Since the latter example is given as better, we'll enhance based on it by adding some non-linear transformations as well as interactions, while avoiding overly complex or redundant transformations like cubes and high-degree polynomials which may lead to overfitting. Here's the improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f12 sqrt, f13 sqrt, f14 sqrt, f15 sqrt, f16 sqrt, f17 sqrt, f18 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f20 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f0 f5 *, f1 f5 *, f2 f5 *, f3 f5 *, f6 f5 *, f7 f5 *, f8 f5 *, f10 f5 *, f17 f5 *, f19 f5 *, f0 log, f1 log, f5 log, f0 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f0 f1 /, f5 f6 +, f3 f8 +]
```

In this set:
- I've retained features already mentioned in the latter example because they incorporate basic, interpretable transformations like sqrt (square root) that help in normalizing the feature space.
- Multiplicative interactions (`f0 f5 *`, etc.) are used to capture potential interactions between base features.
- Added logarithmic (`log`) and reciprocal transformations to handle skewness and create non-linear effects.
- Retained raw features and their basic transformations to ensure that the model can also capture simple linear relationships.
  
This approach enhances interpretability and balances the need for non-linearity without introducing excessive complexity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Given the two sets of transformed features, I'll create a new, potentially improved feature set utilizing transformations that build on your examples. The focus will be on leveraging a combination of transforms and keeping the structure aligned with the postfix notation you've provided:

In this new set, I included a mix of stand_scaler and reciprocal transformations along with some cube and square root transformations to explore different feature interactions. I kept some elements from both examples to ensure consistency with your original format while aiming to enhance predictive capabilities.

```

### Improvements:
1. **New Combination Features**: Combined features like `f0 f8 +` and `f0 f10 f11 + *` aim to capture interactions between multiple metrics that might be influential together.
   
2. **Scaler and Transformation Application**: Applying `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and transformations like `log` and `reciprocal` on selected features helps adjust their scale and distribution, which can enhance model performance and interpretability.

3. **Applying New Non-linear Transformations**: Using `tanh` on `f9 f14` could provide insights into non-linear relationships, capturing more complex variations in the data.

These transformations and feature selections are made to improve the model's ability to distinguish between modules with and without defects by capturing various patterns and interactions in the dataset using diverse approaches.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's an enhanced feature set based on the given examples:

```

### Explanation of Additional Features:
1. **Interaction Terms (`f0 * f6`, `f8 * f9`, `f7 / f16`, `f12 / f7`, `f0 / f11`):**
   - Captures multiplicative and ratio relationships between features that might be indicative of higher complexity or interaction in the code base, relating different metrics for lines of code, complexity, volume, and efforts.

2. **Normalized Features (`f0 minmax_scaler`, `f17 minmax_scaler`, `f7 stand_scaler`):**
   - Min-max and standard scaling help in normalizing the data, making the model more robust to features with different magnitudes.

3. **Non-linear Transformations (`f5 tanh`, `f8 reciprocal`):**
   - Applying hyperbolic tangent and reciprocal transformations can capture non-linear patterns and reduce the impact of skewness.

4. **Basic Statistical Transformations (`f4 square`):**
   - Squaring captures the impact of large values, which might reveal the significance of the total number of operators and operands.

These additional transformations and interactions are meant to help capture various patterns and relationships in the data that direct transformations might not reveal, thus improving the predictive power of models built using this feature set.

This expanded feature set includes:
- Application of `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and `sqrt` functions to select features to capture potential nonlinearities and varying scales in the data.
- Addition of interaction terms and combinations, e.g., division and multiplication to explore relationships between features.
- Use of scaling techniques like `minmax_scaler` and `standard_scaler` to potentially improve the stability and convergence of machine learning algorithms.
- Inclusion of more complex transformations to uncover hidden patterns in the data that may not be apparent in original features.

We'll take into consideration both transformed features and the standardized versions to ensure downstream models can perform well. Below is a combined and extended feature set that aims to improve on the previous examples:

**Explanation:**

- The new feature set retains most of the original features, ensuring the model has access to the raw data.
- The `f5 log` and `f14 reciprocal` transformations capture non-linear relationships.
- The `f7 cubic` and `f4 sqrt` provide alternative representations that capture different scales of variation.
- The `f19 tanh` transformation could be useful for handling bounded cyclical patterns or saturation effects.
- Composite features like `f5 f9 + sqrt` and `f0 f1 *` introduce interactions between features, potentially capturing joint effects on the target.
- Standard scaling and other scaling techniques such as `minmax_scaler` are applied where appropriate to normalize feature distributions, which can enhance model convergence and prediction stability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:57:48,257 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, I will generate a better feature set for improved predictions:

1. Keep all the existing raw features, since they contain the original information.
2. Maintain transformations like cube, sqrt, and log, as they help model non-linear relationships.
3. Remove redundant transformations or those that don't fundamentally add new insights if already represented in other forms.
4. Retain features employing scalers and advanced transformations like sigmoid, since these can help in feature normalization and non-linear transformation.
5. Use mathematical and statistical operations that enhance feature interactions and improve model interpretability.

Here is the improved feature set:

We'll evaluate which transformations seem useful and build upon them to create a more potent feature set.

1. We'll utilize some non-linear transformations such as `sqrt` and `sin`, which often help in capturing non-linear relationships.
2. We'll use operations like multiplication and addition to create interaction features between several components.
3. Let's also incorporate feature scaling to maintain the balance and enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.

Here is the improved feature set created based on the provided examples:

```

In this feature set:

- Added interactions emphasized by `*` which could highlight complex patterns.
- Leveraged `sqrt` and `sin` due to their presence in both examples, aiding in capturing variance.
- Incorporated `quan_trans` and `sigmoid` as they facilitate transformations that can be beneficial for the classification task.
- Advanced combinations like `f0 f10 * f17 *` and `f6 f12 + sqrt` aim to retain relevant patterns and relationships between original features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 11:58:01,588 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set by incorporating transformations that may capture more predictive information, we can consider additional features derived from combinations of existing ones, as well as novel transformations. Here is a new and better feature set incorporating the given transformations:

```

```

In this improved feature set, additional composite features have been added, involving multiplication and division of selected features, in order to capture interactions that might be predictive. The transformations include:

- `f0 f8 *`: Product of features f0 and f8, potentially capturing an interaction effect.
- `f7 f9 /`: Division of features f7 by f9, which might highlight proportional relationships.
- `f10 f11 +`: Sum of features f10 and f11, potentially capturing additive relationships.
- `f8 f9 -`: Difference between features f8 and f9, capturing contrasting relationships.
- `f12 cube sqrt log`: A combination of cube, square root, and logarithm applied to f12, potentially capturing non-linear relations.
- `f6 sqrt log`: Combination of square root and logarithm applied to f6, providing a different transformation capturing logarithmic scaling post square root.

This set of features aims to enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships and variabilities in the data, potentially benefiting the downstream predictive task.

2026-01-12 11:58:23,284 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, we can focus on strategies that enhance interpretability, condition the data for improved learning, and explore interactions that could highlight relevant patterns. Here’s a proposed feature set:

[f0, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f16, f17, f0 cube, f4 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f10 cube, f12 cube, f17 cube, f0 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f12 sqrt, f16 sqrt, f17 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f20 sqrt, f4 cube sqrt, f6 cube sqrt, f7 cube sqrt, f8 cube sqrt, f12 cube sqrt, f16 cube sqrt, f17 cube sqrt, f8 sigmoid, f11 square, f12 sin, f20 sqrt log, f0 log, f8 sigmoid log, f8 sin, f9 stand_scaler, f11 cos, f8 cos, f0 sqrt log, f9 sqrt, f12 reciprocal, f0 * f6, f8 * f9, f7 / f16, f0 minmax_scaler, f5 tanh, (f12 / f7) * f9, f0 / (f11 + 1), f8 reciprocal, f17 minmax_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f4 square]

**Key augmentations:**

1. **Feature Conditioning**: By incorporating transformations like stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, and reciprocal, we're tailoring the feature conditioning to possibly aid in regularization and handling skewness. These operations assist in making the features more compatible for algorithms sensitive to scale.

2. **Trigonometric Functions**: Adding sinusoidal transformations like `f12 sin` explores cyclic behavior, which might capture hidden periodic patterns in software defects.

3. **Interactions & Ratios**: Introducing interactions such as `(f12 / f7) * f9` can highlight relationships between complexity and code length that aren't immediately visible in raw features. The transformation `f0 / (f11 + 1)` adjusts for zero division possibilities while exploring the relationship between line count and time estimator.

4. **Logarithms and Exponentials**: Using operations like `log` and `cube sqrt` enable a more meaningful representation of skewed or highly variable data, potentially capturing multiplicative effects.

5. **Augmented Feature Composition**: Retaining transformations like `cube`, `sqrt`, and `sigmoid` for various features can reveal nonlinear relationships and ensure a wide coverage of potential feature dynamics.

This feature set focuses on a mixture of scalable transformations, interaction captures, and non-linear relationships, designed to extract nuanced information from the existing data for software defect prediction.

This feature set introduces new transformations such as multiplication, division, logarithm, reciprocals, and more non-linear transformations (like tanh and square) to capture complex interactions and patterns in the data that might be beneficial for defect prediction. These transformations can potentially enhance the model's ability to learn and generalize from the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Here's a breakdown of the additions:
- Included `f21 sqrt` to perform additional transformations that might extract useful variance from the `f21` feature.
- Added `f7 / f1` and `f8 / f0` to explore interactions between features that might capture important relationships (e.g., complexity features relative to lines of code).

The goal is to maximize the information captured in the feature set while maintaining relevance to the problem domain.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

 f8 * f8 * f8 // Added f8 cube alternative]
```

Explanation for the new additions:
- **f1 * f5**: Interaction between two features might capture relationships between different code metrics that aren't apparent when viewing them in isolation.
- **f7 / f9**: A ratio of complexity and effort might indicate how efficiently complexity translates to effort, which can be indicative of defects.
- **f11 + f8**: Summation can suggest combined effects; for example, how branching and difficulty together affect defects.
- Adding an extra cube transformation (`f8 * f8 * f8`) provides diversity from existing transformations, which might capture subtle data patterns better.

These new features try to exploit potential interactions and non-linear relationships that could improve the outcome prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:58:55,142 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by incorporating the transformations from the given examples, let's consider the key techniques used in both and attempt to build on them. Each feature set is derived with the goal of improving predictive performance by using transformations and interactions that may better capture the relationships in the data set. Therefore, I will include the most potentially informative transformations and interactions from both examples while also suggesting a few additional combinations that may further enhance model performance. 

Here's the new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f7 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sigmoid ,f11 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f13 sqrt ,f14 sqrt ,f15 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f9 f11 - ,f5 f7 *, f5 quan_trans ,f9 cube ,f5 f5 + ,f18 sin ,f5 t]
```

This new feature set includes:

1. Original features: [f0, ..., f20]
2. Square root transformation of various features to help normalize skewed distributions.
3. Sigmoid transformation of f9, a likely important feature involved in non-linear interactions.
4. Quantile transformation to scale f5, allowing better handling of outliers and non-standard distributions.
5. Difference between f9 and f11, which might introduce a new pattern.
6. Product combination of f5 and f7, which might capture interactions between these features.
7. Cubing f9 to test for higher-order interactions and non-linear effects.
8. Sum of the feature f5 with itself as an exploratory non-linear term.
9. Sine transformation of f18, considered likely to contain periodic patterns.

The key strategy here is the combination of transformations and interactions to create a versatile set of features that may improve the predictive capability of models trained on this data set.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:59:10,640 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set by taking inspiration from the two given examples, we'll want to incorporate elements of both examples while also integrating some operations that could further enhance the feature transformations. The first list seems to focus on extensive multiplicative interactions, logarithmic transformations, and selective application of trigonometric and statistical functions. The second list uses cube transformations extensively on most of the features.

Let's try to combine these elements:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 f5 * ,f1 f5 * ,f2 f5 * ,f3 f5 * ,f4 f5 * ,f7 f5 * ,f10 f5 * ,f18 f5 * ,f19 f5 * ,f20 f5 * ,f0 log f5 * ,f2 log f5 * ,f3 log f5 * ,f6 cube ,f7 cube ,f8 cube ,f10 cube ,f12 cube ,f14 cube ,f16 cube ,f18 cube ,f1 reciprocal cube ,f2 f5 * cube ,f3 f5 * cube ,f11 f5 * cube ,f17 f5 * cube ,f0 log f5 * cube ,f6 f5 * cube ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f9 sin ,f4 tanh ,f5 sin log ,f11 sigmoid log ]
```

**Key Points:**
- Both original feature sets and combinations/interactions involving `f5` (since `f5` was used extensively in interactions) are included.
- Cube transformations are applied to most features, which align with both examples.
- Logarithmic transformations (often used to reduce skewness) have been applied where multiplicative interactions occur.
- Trigonometric functions (such as `sin`, `tanh`) and `sigmoid` are used for non-linear transformations to potentially capture complex dependencies.
- Regular scaling (such as `minmax_scaler`) is introduced for features which might benefit from normalization.
- Introducing `reciprocal` to some features may help in managing features with wide ranges and have not been prominently used in past examples, adding diversity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

```

In this feature set:
- I retained the use of basic features to keep the core information.
- I kept transformations such as `sqrt` and `sigmoid`, which might help normalize or smooth certain feature distributions effectively.
- I used `+` and `*` combinations to introduce interactions between existing features, which can capture non-linear relationships.
- Additional transformations like `tanh`, `sin`, and `log` were used to introduce non-linear effects, potentially stabilizing and magnifying relevant signals.
- I included some standard scaling (`minmax_scaler`) to normalize the features, which helps in maintaining numerical stability and is crucial for certain models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

```

I've added:
- `f2 sqrt` and `f2 reciprocal` to derive potential insights from the `v(g)` feature.
- `f3 tanh` to apply a non-linear transformation to `ev(g)`, which could help in capturing non-linear relationships.
- New interactions such as `f9 / f5` and `f13 - f15` to explore relationships between different features.
- Addition of `f18 + f14` to potentially capture dependencies between operators and operands.

These additional transformations and interactions are intended to offer richer features for machine learning algorithms, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
- Included square root transformations for non-linear scaling.
- Introduced log transformations to handle wide-ranging data.
- Added interactions among existing features to capture potential combined effects.
- Used `minmax_scaler` and `tanh` for normalization and non-linear scaling.
- Retained some sinusoidal and exponential transformations to explore periodic effects.
- Balanced between simple arithmetic combinations and more complex transformations like `sigmoid`.

Explanation:
- The provided transformations aim to simplify some features (e.g., square root) and enhance pattern detection through interactions (e.g., additions followed by transformations and sigmoid/log/cosine applications).
- Combinations of multiple features like `(f5 + f9 + f10) sqrt` capture linear interactions which are further scaled.
- Non-linear transformations like log, sigmoid, and cosine are applied to capture different scales and reduce the effect of outliers.
- Reciprocal and tanh operations add non-linearity, helping to mitigate skewness and enhance prediction capabilities.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:59:39,546 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, it seems you are looking to enhance the feature set for better predictive performance by considering both original and transformed features. The latter example utilizes a broader range of features and transformations, including cube transformations for almost all features. While cube transformations can capture non-linear relationships, using them exclusively may lead to overfitting. A balance between various transformations is generally more robust.

Here is a balanced and potentially improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,

f8 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler, 
f4 sigmoid ,f4 sqrt sigmoid]
```

This feature set includes:
- **Cubic transformations** for potential non-linear relationships, but only on selected features to prevent overfitting.
- **Square root transformations** to reduce the skewness of some features, helping in setting the scale.
- **Sine transformations** to catch periodic patterns that might exist in the data due to code structure.
- **Min-max scaling** to normalize selected features, improving the model’s convergence.
- **Sigmoid transformation** to compress the range, particularly useful for nonlinear distribution and to mitigate the effects of extreme values. 

This combination should provide diversity in capturing complex patterns and features' interactions while considering the robustness of the feature set.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:59:52,412 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature sets provided and aiming for an improved prediction feature set, the latter feature set is already more complex and diverse than the first due to its inclusion of various transformations like cube root, log, sigmoid, and trigonometric functions. However, we can still attempt to create an even better version by introducing additional comprehensive transformations that could help capture non-linear relationships and interactions. Here's an enhanced feature set considering the previous examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f16 ,f17 ,f0 cube ,f4 cube ,f6 cube ,f7 cube ,f8 cube ,f10 cube ,f12 cube ,f17 cube ,f0 sqrt ,f7 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f4 cube sqrt ,f6 cube sqrt ,f7 cube sqrt ,f8 cube sqrt ,f12 cube sqrt ,f16 cube sqrt ,f17 cube sqrt ,f8 sigmoid ,f11 square ,f20 sqrt log ,f0 log ,f8 sigmoid log ,f11 cos ,f8 cos ,f0 sqrt log ,f9 sqrt ,f9 sqrt sqrt ,f9 cos ,f7 f8 *,f6 f17 +,f8 tanh ,f8 sqrt f16 sqrt *,f6 f12 /,f7 sqrt f11 /,f0 sqrt f10 sqrt *,f6 f8 * f9 f17 + *]
```

### Explanation of Enhancements:
1. **Non-linear Interactions:** Included interactions such as `f7 f8 *` and `f6 f12 /` to capture multiplicative and ratio relationships which might show the combination of complexity metrics with Halstead metrics.
   
2. **Use of tanh:** Applying the `tanh` transformation (`f8 tanh`) which can map inputs to a smaller range and handle skewness in the data, assisting in capturing normalized behaviors.

3. **Advanced Combined Features:**
   - `f8 sqrt f16 sqrt *`: Square root transformations of two features multiplied to explore their joint non-linear impact.
   - `f6 f8 * f9 f17 + *`: More complex interactions by combining multiplication and addition to explore higher-order interactions.

By introducing these additional transformations, the intention is to enhance the model's ability to detect more complex patterns and relationships in the data related to software defects.

2026-01-12 11:59:59,986 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, the task involves transforming existing features using various mathematical and statistical operations to potentially enhance prediction capabilities. The transformation should focus on creating new features that capture meaningful interactions or provide normalized/scaled instances of existing features.

Here's a feature set example that builds upon the transformations observed in the previous examples and aims to enhance prediction quality:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f4 log ,f5 log ,f6 log ,f7 log ,f5 f10 * ,f11 reciprocal ,f12 reciprocal ,f15 reciprocal ,f5 square ,f9 tanh ,f18 tanh ,f9 f7 + ,f6 f14 / ,f20 f3 / ,f19 sigmoid]
```

This transformation involves the following operations:

- **Scaling**: Use min-max scaling on selected features like `f0` and `f1` to normalize their values between 0 and 1.
- **Log transformation**: Apply log transformation to features (`f4`, `f5`, `f6`, and `f7`) to handle skewness and stabilize variance.
- **Feature interactions**: Multiply `f5` (Halstead 'program length') by `f10` (Halstead time estimator) to capture any relation between complexity and time estimation.
- **Reciprocal transformation**: Apply reciprocal on `f11`, `f12`, and `f15` to enhance features that may benefit from inversion due to scale or distribution.
- **Non-linear transformations**: Use square and tanh on specific features (`f5` and `f9`, respectively) to introduce non-linear elements that might capture complex patterns.
- **Arithmetic combinations**: Sum and divide specific features (`f9` with `f7`, and `f6` with `f14`, `f20` with `f3`) to explore interactions and ratios that may correlate with the prediction target.
- **Sigmoid**: Employ sigmoid transformation on `f19` to squash its values between 0 and 1, potentially improving model interpretability and performance in downstream tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:00:06,781 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that improves predictions by building on the given feature examples, let's focus on using transformations that help capture non-linear relationships and reduce dimensionality while retaining the most predictive information. The combinations should leverage different transformations for potential insights:

1. Apply square root and logarithmic transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
2. Use combinations of cube and square transformations for interactions and higher-order terms.
3. Apply sigmoid and trigonometric functions for bounded transformations and periodic relationships.

Here's a new feature set that tries to improve on previous examples:

```

This set:
- Uses basic features directly for their interpretability.
- Explores nonlinear transformations (e.g., cube, square root) to capture complex relationships.
- Uses log transformation for stabilizing variance and making relationships linear.
- Employs trigonometric and sigmoid functions for capturing potential periodicity.
- Includes reciprocal transformation for highly skewed distributions.

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features:** Retain a selection of original features that capture fundamental metrics.
- **Multiplicative Interactions:** Include pairs (e.g., `f0 f5 *`) to capture interactions between certain features.
- **Logarithmic Transformations:** Use logarithms on multiplicative interactions to reduce skewness and capture multiplicative relationships in an additive form.
- **Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions:** Apply `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, and `sinh` to capture cyclic patterns and non-linear relationships.
- **Cubing and Rooting:** Apply `cube` to emphasize the magnitude differences, and `sqrt` to dampen large values.
- **Scaling:** Use `minmax_scaler` to normalize specific features and their interactions, ensuring they are comparable within the 0 to 1 range.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 12:00:20,973 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two provided examples, I'll aim to combine useful transformations with some additional operations that could capture deeper patterns. We should focus on ensuring a comprehensive transformation while maintaining some degree of diversity in the operations applied. Here's the new feature set:

```

```
Key Improvements:
- Retained diverse transformations: Square root, sigmoid, and sin are prominently used as these can help in normalizing and capturing non-linear relationships.
- Added combinations that may reveal interactions: Multiplying and adding different features such as `f6 f7 *` and `f5 f9 +` might uncover useful interactions between the features.
- Keeping operations that could lower noise: The `f9 f11 *` operation is retained as it might capture a significant interaction from the original suggestions.
- Combining features into non-linear relationships: Using operations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and division may enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns.

**Explanation:**

- Retained core features: Keeping foundational features like `f0, f5, ...` as they provide basic information.
- Included various transformation techniques: Applied `cube`, `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, `log`, and other transformations to extract nonlinear relationships and scales.
- Combination of features: Created new features by combining existing ones (e.g., `f0 * f6`, `f8 * f9`) to capture interactions between them.
- Minmax scaling: Applied on several features to ensure they are normalized within a specific range.
- Introduced additional transformations: Such as `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and feature combinations, expanding the feature set's dimensionality and capturing more complex patterns.
- Engineered complex interactions: By using combinations like `f11 cos * f7 sqrt`, `f16 sqrt / f0`, and other interactions that might highlight multifaceted relationships in the data.

By following this approach, the feature set becomes more robust and expressive, potentially improving the downstream predictive model's performance.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:00:38,045 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set from the given examples, let's analyze the transformations used in both examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Applies `quan_trans` to `f5`.
   - Applies `sigmoid` to `f9`.
   - Computes the difference `f9 - f11`.
   - Computes the cube of `f9`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Applies `sqrt` to multiple features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, etc.).
   - Combines features with `f9 * f11`.
   - Applies `sigmoid` and `sin` to `f5`.
   - Applies `sin` to `f18`.
   - Computes the sum `f5 + f5`.

A better feature set could incorporate useful transformations used in both examples. Here's an improved feature combination:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:
- I retained the `sqrt` operations from the second example as they can help in normalizing features and reducing skewness.
- Included `quan_trans` on `f5`, as it is a more general transformation useful for normalizing and handling feature quantiles.
- Added `exp` to both `f9` and `f11`, synthesizing nonlinear relationships present in the data.
- Included combination transformations like `f9 * f11` and `f9 / f11` for capturing interaction effects.
- Kept `sigmoid` on `f9` for compression and normalization.
- Used `tanh` on `f5` for range compression similar to `sigmoid` but symmetric about the origin.
- Retained operations like `sin` on `f5` and `f18` to model periodicity if present.

This constructed set aims to handle various feature scales and distributions, capture possible interactions, and leverage nonlinear transformations to improve prediction performance.

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Additions & Transformations:**
   - Introduced `f5 sqrt` and `f5 sqrt log` based on `f5`, enhancing these with additional transformations due to its involvement in both example sets.
   - Added `f9 sqrt cos` to explore complex interactions of feature `f9`, following its multiple transformations in the second example.

2. **Removing Unnecessary Overlaps:**
   - Avoid duplicate transformations unless they're proven particularly useful across most instances.

3. **Consistency with Given Examples:**
   - Maintained many similar features to ensure continuity in feature selection while focusing on enhancing transformations, notably `f5` and `f9`.

This feature set aims to leverage transformations' potential for unearthing deeper patterns within the data relevant to defect prediction.

- The transformed features include a mix of arithmetic, logarithmic, trigonometric, and scaling transformations to enhance pattern detection.
- Incorporation of different combination techniques such as division and addition allows for capturing more complex relations in the data. 
- The operations like `cos` and `sin` help capture periodic behaviors in data. 
- The inclusion of `log`, `sqrt`, and `sin` operations can help with skewness and normalization, potentially aiding in capturing non-linear relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2026-01-12 12:00:55,389 - INFO - llm output = Using the provided feature transformations and based on the two examples, I will attempt to create a better feature set by incorporating diverse transformations and scaling techniques that may capture better relationships in the data. Here is the resulting feature set:

```plaintext

 f5 f10 /, f5 f7 * log, f9 cubic, f11 f13 sqrt, f19 stand_scaler]
```

In this new feature set:

- I've kept some of the foundational transformations from both examples, such as `f9 cube` and `f9 tanh`, which could encapsulate non-linear relationships.
- Introduced `f5 f7 * log` to capture multiplicative interactions between features and apply a logarithmic compression, potentially useful for reducing skewness.
- `f11 f13 sqrt` combines two features with a square root transformation to explore potential interactions.
- Retained and further utilized scaling techniques like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to ensure the features are normalized and standardized, helping with model convergence and performance.
- `f5 quan_trans` and `f9 sigmoid` have been included again, considering they could help by addressing outliers and non-linear patterns, respectively.

This blend of transformations seeks to maximize the potential of capturing intricate interactions and distributions within the data, possibly enhancing predictive performance.

### Explanation for Added Features:
1. **f8 tanh:** Since hyperbolic tangent (tanh) can help in scaling features, applying it to f8 (which seems to have a significant range given the transformations applied) could be beneficial.
2. **f5 sigmoid:** Sigmoid mapping could be useful for any feature, helping with scaling values between 0 and 1.
3. **f10 / (f11 + 1):** Interaction between features could unearth hidden patterns. We add 1 to the denominator to prevent division by zero.
4. **f19 / f8:** Combining features through division can capture dependency ratios between them.
5. **f6 minmax_scaler:** Scaling f6 to [0,1] could address features with varying magnitudes and improve model convergence.
6. **f12 + f8:** Aggregating features could improve the model by combining their information.
7. **f6 * f6:** Though 'cube' is already applied, a pure square might capture some sweet spots that are not captured by the cube.
8. **f7 - f16:** The difference between these two features might reveal useful information about their relationship or interaction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-12 12:01:19,880 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that combines the elements of the two given feature sets and aims for a potentially better predictive power, we should focus on leveraging the existing transformations while introducing a few additional combined transformations that may capture interactions or non-linear relationships. Below is the proposed new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20,

f3 f6 * ,f2 f7 * ,f3 f8 * ,f6 f9 * ,
f0 f1 + f2 + f3 + ,f4 f5 + f6 + f7 + sin
]
```

This set includes:
- The original features to ensure basic information is retained.
- Cubed transformations for most features to capture non-linear patterns.
- Multiplicative interactions between important Halstead metrics and code complexity metrics (e.g., `f3 f6 *`, `f2 f7 *`, etc.).
- Combined interactions between the first few features using addition, along with a `sin` transformation to capture potential periodic or cyclic patterns (`f0 f1 + f2 + f3 +`, `f4 f5 + f6 + f7 + sin`).
- A selected operation alongside standardized and non-linear transformations to capture a wide range of potential interactions and scales.

Note: Depending on the computational budget and the model's interpretability needs, some transformations might be pruned or tuned further.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 12:01:30,706 - INFO - llm output = To improve feature engineering for software defect prediction, we will use the strongest transformations and combinations from the two sets you provided. We aim to develop more predictive features by utilizing meaningful mathematical transformations and interactions. Here's an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f16, f17, f0 cube, f4 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f10 cube, f12 cube, f17 cube, f0 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f12 sqrt, f16 sqrt, f17 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f20 sqrt, f4 cube sqrt, f6 cube sqrt, f8 sigmoid, f11 square, f20 sqrt log, f0 log, f8 sigmoid log, f11 cos, f8 cos, f0 sqrt log, f9 sqrt, f9 sqrt sqrt, f9 cos, f0 * f6, f8 * f9, f7 / f16, f0 minmax_scaler, f5 tanh, f12 / f7, f0 / f11, f8 reciprocal, f17 minmax_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f4 square, (f8 * f9) log, (f0 minmax_scaler) tanh, f8 cube sqrt, f5 sin, f7 tanh, f8 reciprocal sqrt]
```

Here's the reasoning behind selecting each transformation:

1. **Original Features**: Preserving original features (`f0, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f16, f17`) is crucial because they hold the baseline information.

2. **Cube and Cube Root Transformations**: These transformations provide non-linear magnitudes and variations (e.g., `f0 cube`, `f8 cube`, `f8 cube sqrt`).

3. **Square and Sqrt Transformations**: Maintain them for feature scaling and convergence handling (e.g., `f0 sqrt`, `f8 sqrt`, `f9 sqrt sqrt`).

4. **Logarithmic Transformations**: Beneficial for normalizing skewed data (`f0 log`, `f8 sigmoid log`, `(f8 * f9) log`).

5. **Trigonometric Transformations**: Sin and cos functions for capturing periodicity or specific behavior patterns (e.g., `f11 cos`, `f8 cos`, `f5 sin`).

6. **Scaler and Reciprocal Transformations**: For balancing feature scale relative to others (`f0 minmax_scaler`, `f17 minmax_scaler`, `f8 reciprocal`, `f8 reciprocal sqrt`).

7. **Feature Interactions**: Combining features provides additional depth in relationships (e.g., `f0 * f6`, `f8 * f9`, `f7 / f16`).

8. **Non-linear Activation Functions**: Like tanh, to provide feature non-linearities (`f5 tanh`, `f7 tanh`, `(f0 minmax_scaler) tanh`). 

These transformed features enhance model performance by capturing more of the underlying complex relationships that might exist in the data.
