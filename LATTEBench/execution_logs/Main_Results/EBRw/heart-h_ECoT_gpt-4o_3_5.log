2026-01-13 11:08:19,592 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, I will propose a new feature set that incorporates elements from both with some refinements for better prediction of heart disease presence. 

- I will use quantile transformation, which can scale features to follow a uniform or normal distribution, providing robustness against outliers and improving model performance.
- Mathematical transformations such as sin, cos, sqrt, and custom calculations (e.g., differences and simple arithmetic operations) can reveal complex underlying patterns.
- I will include more advanced statistical scaling where relevant.

Here is a refined and potentially more effective feature set:

```

In this feature set:
- I've used quantile transformation on differences and standard mathematical transformations (sin, cos, sqrt) to capture non-linear relationships.
- Combined transformations such as `sqrt` followed by `quan_trans` can be useful for normalizing skewed data and enhancing model effectiveness.
- Used power computations (`pow`) to bring out potentially impactful non-linear relations.
- Retain a diverse range of transformation modalities and numeric feature interactions to ensure comprehensive feature engineering.

Let's analyze and construct a new set of features:

1. **Advanced Mathematical Transformations**: Consider additional complex combinations and transformations like division, cube roots, logarithms, etc., as they're not utilized much in both examples.

2. **Interaction Terms**: Combinations of features may capture non-linear relationships or interactions that are not easily captured by linear models.

3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Using `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `log` can often help account for non-linear distributions.

Here's a new feature set:

```

**Explanation**:
- **Combining and Transforming Features**: New interactions and combinations of features such as `sqrt`, `log`, `sinh`, `sigmoid`, and combined square root with additions or divisions are used to capture different behavioral patterns.
  
- **Complex Operations and Non-linearity**: Using operations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `sinh` attempts to capture non-linear relations. The combination `f2 sqrt f4 f8 + sinh` is an example of introducing non-linearity.

- **Statistical Normalization Attempts**: Using standardized mathematical transformations like `log` or functions like `tanh` on grouped features to smoothen the variations and account for both negative and positive interactions holistically.

This feature set aims to enhance the predictive power of the model by introducing sophisticated transformations and interactions that capture a wider range of potential relationships between the features.

2026-01-13 11:08:44,087 - INFO - llm output = Generating a new feature set with consideration of non-linear transformations, interactions between features, and scaling can improve the prediction of heart disease presence. Here is a suggested feature set based on the two given examples:

1. Use the hyperbolic tangent and quantile transformation to capture non-linear relationships and reduce the impact of outliers:
   - `f2 tanh`
   - `f8 tanh`
   - `f9 tanh`
   - `f0 tanh`
   - `f10 tanh`

2. Explore feature interactions and transformations to capture potential multiplicative relationships:
   - `f0 f8 *`
   - `f0 f10 *`
   - `f7 f9 *`
   - `f2 f0 f8 * *`
   - `f2 f8 *`
   - `f0 f7 *`

3. Apply scaling and quantile transformation to consider implications on larger datasets:
   - `f0 f8 * quan_trans`
   - `f0 f10 * quan_trans`
   - `f2 f8 * quan_trans`
   - `f0 f7 * quan_trans`

4. Utilize additional mathematical transformations that may capture other forms of relationships:
   - `sqrt f8 f9 *`
   - `cos f7 f10 *`
   - `sin f4 f9 *`
   - `reciprocal f2`
   - `sigmoid f3`

This set of feature transformations attempts to capture complex relationships and leverage scaling to ensure robust model training. Note that feature and model selection should also be accompanied by validation and testing on the dataset to ensure practical improvements in predictive accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:08:54,725 - INFO - llm output = To create a more effective feature set based on the given examples, we need to select and transform the features in a way that highlights potentially meaningful interactions and representations that could aid in predicting heart disease. Focusing on functions that can enhance non-linear relationships and capture interactions between features is key. Here's a refined feature set:

```
[f4, f3, f5, f6, f9, f12, f0 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f12 sqrt, f7 square, f6 tanh, f3 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f4 f1 +, f4 f8 +, f4 f2 sqrt +, f3 f5 sqrt +, f5 f8 sqrt +, f9 f10 sqrt +, f11 log, f3 square sin, f7 square cos, f9 tanh sin, f5 f10 reciprocal +, f2 sigmoid, f6 f12 /]
```

Explanation of choices:

1. **Combination of original features**: Retain a diverse set, such as those representing measurements and conditions.
2. **Root transformations**: Applied to features, such as `f0`, `f4`, `f9`, and `f12`, which can manage non-linear scale variances.
3. **Square and standard scaling**: Applied to `f7`, `f3`, and `f9`, useful for capturing variance and distributing data.
4. **Trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations**: Using `sin`, `cos`, and `tanh`, potentially captures cyclic trends and interactions like `f6 tanh` and `f3 square sin`.
5. **Logarithmic and reciprocal transformations**: These can normalize skews and highlight interactions, like `f11 log` and `f5 f10 reciprocal +`.
6. **Combinations/additions of features**: Various combinations to capture interactions, such as `f4 f1 +`, `f4 f2 sqrt +`, and `f5 f10 reciprocal +`.
7. **Sigmoid functions**: Useful for compressing feature ranges, applied directly to `f2`.

This feature set combines different transformations and feature interactions that could enhance the model's ability to detect heart disease presence from the given dataset.

2026-01-13 11:09:10,657 - INFO - llm output = To construct a better feature set based on the provided examples, I will incorporate advanced transformations to potentially capture non-linear relationships and complex interactions between features. The feature set will enhance the prior examples by utilizing operations that could better model the nuances present in the heart disease dataset, given the presence of various categorical and numerical data combined with potential interactions.

Here is the improved feature set proposal:

```

```

Explanation of the improved feature set:
- Utilized a combination of `tanh`, `sqrt`, and `log` to transform the multiplicative interactions for non-linear relationship capture.
- Included `reciprocal` to model inverse relationships, which could be pivotal in scenarios where feature increases could inversely relate to target changes.
- Applied `cube` and `sin` transformations to introduce non-linear variations in feature interactions.
- Used multiple layers of `quan_trans` transformation for complex multivariate distribution conversion.
- Added `pochmann_scaler` and combinations of sinusoidal functions to delve deeper into cyclical patterns and interactions.

Balancing feature engineering with model complexity is key. Let's create a new feature set by considering the transformations used in both of the previous examples and possibly incorporating additional meaningful transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f7 square, f3 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f1 sin, f2 sin, f5 sin, f6 sin, f8 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f11 sin, f12 sin, f3 square sin, f7 square sin, f3 stand_scaler sin, f7 stand_scaler sin, f3 log, f4 reciprocal, f9 sqrt]
```

Here are some explanations for choices made:
- Retain useful non-linear transformations like sine and square.
- Add transformations not in previous sets that may capture additional variability:
  - `f3 log`: Adding log transformation could help in scaling down larger values, offering better linear separability in some cases.
  - `f4 reciprocal`: Emphasizes the effect of smaller values and mitigates the impact of outliers.
  - `f9 sqrt`: May help in bringing down the variance in cases of skewed distributions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

Here are some explanations for the choices made:

1. **Transformation Variety**: By including operations like `log`, `tanh`, `sin`, `cos`, we capture non-linear relationships and interactions within the features which might not be evident with linear transformations alone.

2. **Interaction Terms**: The products and divisions of different features could reveal interactions that significantly affect heart disease prediction, such as `(f3 f9 +) sin` and `(f7 f10 /) cos stand_scaler`.

3. **Scaling and Normalizing**: Standard scaling, quantile transformation, and logarithmic transformations help stabilize variance, especially for features such as blood pressure and cholesterol which might have skewed distributions or outliers in the dataset.

By leveraging these transformations, the feature engineering task aims to improve the model's ability to extract meaningful patterns that correlate with the presence of heart disease.

### Justification:
- **Foundation Features**: Retained foundational features (f0 to f12) to ensure essential data representation.
  
- **Quadratic and Reciprocal Features**: Included square and reciprocal transformations to capture non-linear relationships.

- **Sin Transformations**: Leveraged `sin` to potentially reveal cyclical patterns within data.

- **Standardized Features**: Used `stand_scaler` on significant variables, particularly where baseline subtraction might bring value, as observed in differences.

- **Composite Operations**: Constructed composite operations, such as `f3 f7 - sin` and `f7 f3 - stand_scaler stand_scaler`, to explore interactions between the features.

By using both simple and composite transformations, this feature set aims to encapsulate various interactions and non-linear transformations that might improve model performance when predicting heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-13 11:09:55,805 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, we should focus on creating a new feature set that combines the strengths of both approaches. The first feature set uses a variety of transformations and arithmetic operations, including quantile transformation and cubic features, which may capture more complex relationships. The second feature set emphasizes normalization and non-linear transformations but lacks combinatorial features. 

For the new feature set, we should focus on combining normalized and standardized features with rich non-linear transformations while considering potential interactions between features. Here's an improved feature set:

```plaintext

 f8 f9 * - tanh, 
 f10 stand_scaler sigmoid tanh, 
 f4 f0 f1 - tanh sqrt, 
 f4 f0 f10 - tanh sqrt]
```

In this feature set, we incorporate various scaling techniques (standard scaling, min-max scaling) along with trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations. We also include interaction terms and apply non-linear transformations to capture complex relationships. Specifically, using stand_scaler helps to normalize data features, taking into account the mean and standard deviation, which can be critical for certain machine learning models.

2026-01-13 11:10:18,919 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the provided examples, let's analyze the existing transformations and build a new feature set that incorporates potentially useful transformations for predicting heart disease: 

1. Based on various transformations applied to original features like `f2` (age), `f4` (chol), and `f8` (thalach), it seems that combinations and transformations involving these predictors are potentially valuable.

2. Application of scaling methods such as standard scaler and min-max scaling, sqrt, and sometimes reciprocal transformations appear in both examples, suggesting their contribution to improving model performance.

3. The use of operations like addition and subtraction between different pairs of features, followed by division or scaling, as well as the use of non-linear transformations like sin, and square root, indicate these could capture complex interactions or non-linear relationships present in the data.

Here's a proposed improved feature set:

Let's focus on combining some square root and trigonometric transformations alongside scaling techniques.

Here's a new feature set:

```

In this new set, we are capturing the following aspects:
- Direct usage of original features for simplicity and baseline features.
- Inclusion of square root and square transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Use of trigonometric transformations on certain features for capturing cyclical patterns.
- Application of scaling to normalize features, with a specific focus on combined transformations (e.g., `sqrt cos`, `square tanh`).
- A nuanced inclusion of log transformations with scaling for features that could benefit from more Gaussian-like distributions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set includes:

- Various levels of square root transformations capturing variability in non-linear scales, some further standardized to ensure distribution adapts well across models.
- Log transformations to handle skewness, especially within potentially large measures (e.g., cholesterol levels).
- Interactions between transformed features to capture intricate relationships that might be pivotal in prediction.
- Logical combinations of basic arithmetic operations along with transformations like square root and log for capturing interactive effects and scaling differences.

Such engineered features are expected to improve the model's capacity to discern patterns associated with heart disease accurately.

### Explanation:
- We have retained original numerical features (e.g., f2, f4) and included elementary transformations like `sqrt` and `log` to address skewed distributions.
- The `sigmoid` and `tanh` transformations were kept where appropriate for normalized scaling, enabling nonlinear relationships to be modeled.
- We have included interaction terms such as product and division between features to capture potential relationships or interactions.
- The `minmax_scaler` maintains scaling, especially useful for algorithms sensitive to feature scale, like k-NN.
- The last term `[f0 f7 tanh - tanh *]` is retained from Example 1 as a potentially deep interaction term after transformation. 

This revised feature set aims to enhance the predictive power by exploring non-linearities, interactions, and different scales while keeping the computation manageable.

2026-01-13 11:10:50,232 - INFO - llm output = Here's a potential feature set that combines and refines elements from the two examples provided:

```
[f2, f4, f8, f9, f10, f4 sqrt, f2 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f4 sqrt sigmoid, f2 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f12 tanh, f8 sqrt, f4 minmax_scaler, f4 sqrt log, f0 f4 / tanh * , f4 f0 f2 - sigmoid *, f4 f0 f7 tanh - sigmoid *]
```

Here's the rationale:

1. **Preserve Useful Features**: Retain basic signals (`f2, f4, f8, f9, f10`) in their raw forms, as they have been deemed important in multiple sets.

2. **Logarithmic and Squaring Transformations**: Use `f4 sqrt`, `f4 sqrt log` to capture scaling effects with non-linear relationships.

3. **Standardization and Scaling**: `f4 minmax_scaler` provides normalization to potentially better distinguish feature importance.

4. **Non-linear Activation Functions**:
   - Activation functions like `sigmoid` and `tanh` help in handling non-linearity within data.
   - Include sigmoid and tanh transformations on key features: `f2 sigmoid`, `f8 sigmoid`, `f4 sqrt sigmoid`, `f2 tanh`, `f8 tanh`, `f9 tanh`, `f10 tanh`.

5. **Feature Interactions**:
   - Incorporate some interactions using existing features, adjusted by transformations: `f0 f4 / tanh *` and `f4 f0 f2 - sigmoid *` support combinatorial approach; capturing the relation of baseline with restecg and chest pain.
   - `f4 f0 f7 tanh - sigmoid *`: Captures interactions between exercise angina, thalach, and trestbps.

This refined set aims to balance capturing non-linear relationships, potential interactions, and leveraging transformations that help in clarifying the distinction or prediction of heart disease.

2026-01-13 11:10:54,738 - INFO - llm output = To propose a better feature set, let's integrate elements from both given feature sets, prioritizing relevant transformations for improving the predictability of heart disease presence.

Features in the first set focus on transforming specific original features with `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans`, which can help normalize or distribute the data for better modeling.

The second set features a variety of transformations, particularly related to non-linear transformations like `tanh`, and employs more standardized and reciprocal transformations.

Combining and enhancing selected transformations from both sets, a proposed feature set could be:

``` 
[f3 ,f4 ,f7 ,f8 ,f2 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f2 tanh stand_scaler ,f8 tanh stand_scaler ,f4 quan_trans ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 quan_trans stand_scaler ,f4 reciprocal ,f8 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler cos ,f4 quan_trans tanh stand_scaler ,f4 square stand_scaler ,f8 ,f9 ,f4 square stand_scaler f4 / ,f8 tanh stand_scaler cos]

The key is to build transformations that highlight significant patterns and reduce noise, making the prediction model more effective.

Let's introduce a new feature set that balances complexity with interpretability while improving predictive power based on the previous examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12,

 f3 f8 / stand_scaler, f7 f8 / stand_scaler, f4 f8 / stand_scaler tanh]
```

### Explanation:
- **Standard Scaling & Quantile Transformation**: Standard scaling (`stand_scaler`) of features like `f3`, `f7`, `f4`, and `f8` aims to normalize these features, centering them around zero which can be beneficial for certain models. Quantile transforming (`quan_trans`) selected features to follow a normal distribution improves performance for models sensitive to distribution shapes.
- **Log and Reciprocal Transformations**: Used for skewed distribution handling (`log`) and amplifying the effect of small values (`reciprocal`), which can enhance linear model prediction.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Choosing `sqrt`, `sin`, and `cos` functions, followed by division or multiplication, allows handling of nonlinear relationships hidden in the interaction between features, potentially unearthing insightful interactions within the data.
- **Product with Sigmoid and Min-Max Scaling**: These combinations check interactions (`*`) between features, scaling them and then processing them through activation-like functions (`sigmoid` and `minmax_scaler`) to simulate layers of neural networks or model probability intensities.
- **Tanh for Interaction Effects**: Utilizing `tanh` can help to learn more nuanced relationships between interactions which might prove valuable in non-linear decision boundary formation.

This feature set should contribute to crafting robust models, maintaining simplicity while accommodating complex relationships in the data, reflecting a deeper feature engineering approach.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

**Explanations for additions:**
- `f7 reciprocal` and `f7 square` are kept since they may highlight the inverse relationship or the exponential effect of a feature.
- The subtraction and multiplication (`f3 f7 * stand_scaler`) might reveal interactions between `trestbps` and `thalach`, and are therefore retained and enhanced.
- `f8 log` and `f0 f3 /` are added to capture non-linear relationships involving `exang` and ratios involving `age` and `trestbps`, which can be relevant in health-related datasets.
- Adding ratios and transformations (e.g., logarithmic) can help in revealing patterns that stand out better than the original variables.

3. Redundant features like `f1 sigmoid` are removed because 'f1' was only initially transformed in the first example but omitted in transformations in the second example.
4. Included additional complex transformations like `f4 sqrt tanh`, which offers another non-linear transformation option, potentially capturing new relationships.

- Advanced non-linear and dimensionality transformation combinations for interactions (e.g., `f0 f2 tanh * f4 *`).
- Combinations of transformations to enhance feature variability, like `f8 tanh stand_scaler cos`.
- Retained some simple yet effective transformations from the examples such as `f4 reciprocal` to deal with potential skewness in the data.
- Applied `quant_trans` and `stand_scaler` to interact with features and capture complex relationships effectively.

By examining the given examples, it's clear that deeper transformations and continuous operations, particularly based on quantile transformation, yield richer representations. Here's a new, more sophisticated feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f3 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f3 square, f7 square, f2 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f11 quan_trans, f12 quan_trans, f3 f4 /, f7 f4 /, f3 cos, f7 cos, f3 square quan_trans, f7 square quan_trans, f3 f4 / quan_trans, f7 f4 / quan_trans, f3 stand_scaler f4 /, f3 stand_scaler f4 / quan_trans, f7 stand_scaler f4 /, f7 stand_scaler f4 / quan_trans, f2 quan_trans f4 quan_trans /, f8 quan_trans f9 quan_trans *, f10 tanh f11 quan_trans tanh *, f9 quan_trans tanh f10 tanh /, f12 quan_trans f7 square quan_trans +, f3 cos f8 quan_trans tanh *, f5 quan_trans square f2 quan_trans +, f6 quan_trans square f2 quan_trans tanh /]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Standard Scaling and Squaring**: Applying standard scaling and squaring transformations to features like f3 and f7 helps normalize and accentuate their variance.

2. **Quantile Transformation Layers**: Extending the use of quantile transformation on multiple levels provides a robust non-linear transformation, capturing the skewness and statistical distribution better.

3. **Operational Combinations**: Combining features through division and multiplication (e.g., `f2 quan_trans f4 quan_trans /`) helps explore potential interactions.

4. **Non-linear Transformations**: Including non-linear transformations like cosine (`f3 cos`) and hyperbolic tangent (`f10 tanh`) helps model complex relationships by adding a non-linear component.

5. **Complex Combinations**: Using multiple combinations of these transformed features to potentially capture more intricate patterns in the data relationships (e.g., `f10 tanh f11 quan_trans tanh *`).

Through these transformations and combinations, we aim to capture more of the intrinsic structure and relationships within the data that are indicative of the presence of heart disease.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-13 11:11:39,381 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples you've provided, I'll create a better feature set focusing on a combination of transformations that maximize the diversity and potential usefulness of features, aiming for a balance between the complexity and interpretability:

1. Include diverse transformations like scaling, trigonometric, logarithmic, reciprocals which might help in capturing non-linear relationships.
   
2. Incorporate combinations of transformations to harness synergies between different mathematical operations.

Here's a better feature set:

```
[f2, f4, f8, f9, f10, f4 sqrt, f4 square, f1 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f2 cos, f8 cos, f9 cos, f10 cos, f4 sqrt tanh, f4 square tanh, f2 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f4 square minmax_scaler, f4 sqrt minmax_scaler, f2 cos minmax_scaler, f9 cos minmax_scaler, f4 log minmax_scaler, f4 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal tanh]
```

In this new set:
- Retained essential transformations that offer good differentiation: tanh, cos, sqrt, square.
- Introduced reciprocal on `f4` and `f10`, which can be powerful for certain features.
- Combined transformations like `f2 reciprocal tanh` to examine interactions.
- Removed redundant or overly complex transformations like multiple layers of sigmoid-tanh, focusing instead on potentially interpretable and impactful combinations.

### Explanation:
- **Maintained Features**: I kept the useful transformations and interactions observed in the latter example.
- **New Features**:
  - Added `f4 quan_trans tanh stand_scaler sqrt`: Applies sqrt, aiming to capture non-linear interactions in quantile-transformed and scaled data.
  - Added `f4 quan_trans tanh stand_scaler f4 square stand_scaler /`: Interaction between transformed `f4` features, exploring synergies between squared and tanh-transformed data.
  - Combined additional transformations to explore complex non-linear relationships, which may capture interactions in the underlying patterns of heart disease prediction.

This set uses statistical transformation (quantile, stand_scaler, and minmax_scaler) and non-linear transformation functions (tanh, sqrt, cos) to capture complex interactions and distributions in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Given the provided feature sets, the latter one already includes useful transformations like standard scaling, quantile transformation, and various nonlinear transformations which are generally helpful. Let's construct a new feature set that emphasizes potentially informative transformations:

```plaintext

```

Here are some specific changes and enhancements made:

1. Prior successful transformations like standard scaling and quantile transformation are retained, as they have already shown effectiveness in the previous set.
2. Nonlinear transformations like `log` and `reciprocal` are used judiciously to capture nonlinearity without overly complicating the feature set.
3. `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cos` are used to capture various nonlinear patterns potentially related to heart disease.
4. Enhanced combinations of features using arithmetic and customizable transformations like `*` (multiplication) and compound scaling.
5. Consideration of dimensionality and interpretability, aiming for a balance between diversity of features and overfitting prevention.

It's essential to include a mix of basic transformations (like standard scaling, square, sin) with interaction terms (adding, subtracting, and scaling combinations of features) to explore nonlinear relationships and interactions.

Here's a new feature set inspired by the two provided examples:

```

In this feature set, I included combinations of original features with transformations like square and sin, and introduced interaction terms such as `f2 square f3 square + sqrt`, which captures the combined squared effect and nonlinearity of features f2 and f3. I've also incorporated interactions like `f6 sin f7 +` to explore additive relationships after transformation. The purpose of these combinations is to capture complex nonlinear relationships that might be predictive of heart disease.

2026-01-13 11:12:09,683 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and transformations, we want to combine useful transformations from both to create a more informative feature set for predicting the presence of heart disease. Here's a new suggested feature set:

```
[f2, f4, f8, f9, f10, f2 sigmoid, f3 f4 *, f4 sqrt, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f4 square, f1 tanh, f4 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f3 f4 * minmax_scaler, f2 cos minmax_scaler, f8 sigmoid tanh, f9 sigmoid tanh, f10 sigmoid tanh, f4 sqrt log, f4 f4 sqrt log -, f4 tanh minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: Retained the essential features `[f2, f4, f8, f9, f10]` to start from a comprehensive base.
- **Interaction & Nonlinear Transformations**: 
  - `f2 sigmoid` captures non-linear characteristics of `f2`.
  - `f3 f4 *` captures an interaction between `f3` and `f4` which could be informative.
  - `f4 sqrt` provides a smoothed version of heavily skewed `f4`.
  - `f8 tanh`, `f9 tanh`, `f10 tanh` attempt to linearize features while managing outliers.
  - `f4 square` captures growth patterns of `f4`.
  - `f1 tanh`, `f4 sqrt log`, `f4 f4 sqrt log -` offer complex transformations for deeper insights.
- **Normalization and Scaling**: 
  - Min-Max scaling on `f4`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10` normalizes these features for models sensitive to input ranges.
  - `f3 f4 * minmax_scaler` and `f2 cos minmax_scaler` further captures standardized interactions.
- **Additional Complex Transformations**:
  - `f8 sigmoid tanh`, `f9 sigmoid tanh`, `f10 sigmoid tanh` as a second layer of non-linear transformation.
  - `f4 tanh minmax_scaler` ties normalization after non-linear transformation anticipating outliers.

By combining linearization, interaction, and normalization techniques, the provided feature set should offer strong predictive power for heart disease diagnosis.

2026-01-13 11:12:15,480 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set for predicting heart disease, I'll leverage both existing transformations and propose new ones:

```
[f2, f8, f9, f10, f12, f4 f2 * , f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f4 quan_trans,
f4 f2 * cube, f4 f8 * cube, f4 f9 * cube, f4 f0 f8 - tanh * cube,

f4 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler,
sqrt f3 f4 * , sqrt f4 square, f4 cube]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Transformations and Interactions:**
   - Retain important features already present, focusing on those that are continuously transformed, such as `f2, f8, f9, f10, f12`.
   - Complex interactions like `f4 f2 *` which indicate multiplicative interactions have been preserved, and enhanced with a cube operation where multiscale interactions are desirable.

2. **Enhanced Feature Generation:**
   - Introduce additional direct nonlinear transformations of important features using cube and tanh operations.
   - Utilize `sqrt` and `log` transformations which may reveal relationships on another scale, particularly useful in biomedical data.
   
3. **Scaler and Quantile Transformations:**
   - Apply `minmax_scaler` to ensure all features are normalized, helping decision-boundary-based models perform better.
   - Apply `quan_trans` to certain features, revealing non-linear relationships by normalizing the distribution.

4. **Complex Interactions and Deep Transformations:**
   - Leverage deeper interaction transformations such as `cube` on combinations of feature interactions to access higher-order relationships.
   - Include square transformations of direct and polynomial features for capturing asymmetric variation.

This structure aims at capturing deep interactions, nonlinear relationships, and ensures all features are optimally scaled, which can greatly help in predictive tasks involving heart disease.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

**Rationale:**
1. **Inclusion of Original Features**: Maintains all basic features which might inherently carry important information.
2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Use of `sin`, `square`, and `reciprocal` functions to capture potential non-linear relationships.
3. **Feature Scaling**: `stand_scaler` on certain features to manage different scales and improve robustness of algorithms.
4. **Derived Feature Ratios**: Retains use of ratios like `f5 f4 /` to assess relative changes or combined effects.
5. **Feature Interactions**: Incorporate both interactions and their standardized forms where the expression is potentially informative (`f7 f3 - stand_scaler stand_scaler` uses interaction and scaling).
6. **Redundancy Reduction**: Removal of expressions that appeared redundant upon evaluation across both given examples.

This set prioritizes transformations that are likely to enhance prediction accuracy by exposing complex data relationships and ensuring good scaling practices.

**Explanation of New Additions:**
- `f8 f4 /`: This feature could capture the ratio of maximum heart rate to chest pain type, which might indicate stress levels induced by chest pain.
- `f3 f7 *`: Combining blood pressure and maximum heart rate, this interaction could reveal cardiovascular stress.
- `f7 reciprocal`: The reciprocal of maximum heart rate as it approaches a potential threshold indicative of stress.
- `f2 log sigmoid`: This feature provides a non-linear transformation of age, capturing the effect of aging exponentially.

This set aims to leverage potential interactions between the existing features, apply transformations that handle the data's non-linearity, and standardize feature scales where applicable.
