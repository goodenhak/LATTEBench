2026-01-12 11:13:00,480 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we should aim to include meaningful transformations and interactions while maintaining diversity in the feature space. The second example offers a comprehensive set of original features with one transformation. We can build on that by incorporating additional transformations and interactions to further enrich the feature set.

Here is an improved feature set:

```

```

This feature set includes:
- All original features for comprehensive coverage.
- Square root transformation of `f12` from the second example, maintaining its utility.
- Additional transformations: logarithm (`f3 log`), reciprocal (`f7 reciprocal`), square (`f9 square`), cube (`f14 cube`), hyperbolic tangent (`f6 tanh`), and sigmoid (`f15 sigmoid`) to capture non-linear relationships.
- New interactions: division (`f1/f2`), multiplication (`f9*f11`), addition (`f4+f18`), subtraction (`f19-f5`) to capture potential feature interactions and dependencies. 

These transformations and feature interactions are intended to enrich the feature space and enhance model capability by capturing various data relationships.

2026-01-12 11:13:11,399 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets provided, the goal is to generate a better feature set by applying appropriate transformations and combining the features to enhance predictive capabilities.

The first set includes a variety of transformations such as quantile transformation, subtraction, tanh, cube, reciprocal, min-max scaling, and standard scaling. The second set is more straightforward, consisting primarily of basic features with standard scaling and sigmoid applied to `f4`.

To create a better feature set, we will combine the simplicity of the second set with some of the powerful transformations from the first set, ensuring we retain valuable transformations that may capture non-linear relationships and normalize the data efficiently.

Here's a proposed feature set, combining elements from both examples:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f4 stand_scaler ,f4 sigmoid ,f4 quan_trans ,f0 tanh ,f1 f4 + tanh ,f4 sqrt stand_scaler ,f0 f1 - cube ,f3 f1 - f4 + ,f4 sqrt ,f3 sigmoid ,f6 f1 - cube cos]
```

**Explanation of Transformation Choices:**

1. **Basic Features:** Retain all original features (`f0` to `f19`) for fundamental predictive elements.
2. **Standard Scaling of `f4`:** Standard scaling helps to reduce the influence of outliers and normalize feature magnitudes.
3. **Sigmoid of `f4`:** Sigmoid transformation provides bounded outputs which might be useful for classification tasks like credit approval.
4. **Quantile Transformation of `f4`:** Helps in transforming the distributions to reduce skewness.
5. **Tanh of `f0` & Complex Tanh Combination:** Tanh applied to `f0` and a combination of `f1` and `f4`, to capture non-linear relationships and interactions.
6. **Cube of Difference (Complex Cube Transformations):** Cubing differences (`f0 - f1`, `f0 - f4`) captures exaggerated non-linear difference interactions which might highlight key differences in attributes.
7. **Sqrt and Sigmoid Transforms:** Apply additional sqrt and sigmoid transformations individually for capturing different scales and interactions.
8. **Trigonometric Feature (`cos`):** For capturing cyclical patterns or periodic trends within the data.

This new feature set aims to balance the complexity and diversity of transformations thereby enhancing the potential for better prediction outcomes, while maintaining computational efficiency.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
- Applied square root transformations to all features to help in normalizing skewed distributions (common in financial data).
- Added standard scaling to `f1` to ensure it has zero mean and unit variance, making the features more comparable and potentially improving predictive performance.

2026-01-12 11:13:38,994 - INFO - llm output = To combine the two given feature sets into a new and potentially better feature set, we can examine both for useful transformations and combine them while maintaining diversity and potential benefits from complex transformations.

Let's create a new feature set leveraging transformations from both examples, adding new, useful transformations when applicable:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f4 ,f5 ,f1 log ,f0 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt ,f5 sqrt sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f1 log sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f6 sqrt sqrt ,f19 sqrt sqrt ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f2 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f11 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f19 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f1 log sqrt minmax_scaler ,f0 sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f2 sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f1 log sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f1 log sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f19 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f1 log sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f18 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f6 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f19 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f1 log tanh ,f1 log sqrt sqrt tanh ,f6 sigmoid]
```

In this better feature set:
- Added `f1 log sqrt sqrt tanh` to explore the non-linear behaviors of logarithm, square root, and hyperbolic tangent applied sequentially.
- Added `f6 sigmoid` to introduce a sigmoid transformation which can map values into the (0,1) range, useful for probability estimation and capturing non-linear relationships.

This approach ensures a variety of transformations for capturing different patterns, while integrating potentially useful non-linear transformations for better prediction tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:13:51,851 - INFO - llm output = In analyzing the two given feature sets, the goal is to create a more effective feature set that may offer better predictive capabilities for the downstream task.

To achieve that, let's focus on utilizing variations of feature transformations and combinations that emphasize non-linear relationships, compactness, and depth, which are valuable in complex decision-making tasks like credit approval prediction. Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f2 ,f4 ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt sigmoid ,f2 sqrt sqrt sigmoid ,f0 sqrt sqrt ,f11 sqrt sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f19 sigmoid ,f0 sqrt sigmoid ,f1 sqrt sqrt sigmoid ,f18 sigmoid ,f2 sqrt sigmoid ,f11 sqrt sqrt sigmoid ,f1 sqrt sqrt sqrt sigmoid sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sigmoid sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sigmoid sqrt ,f0 sqrt sigmoid sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sigmoid sqrt ,f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f5 sqrt sqrt ,f9 sqrt sqrt sigmoid ,f2 square ,f2 square quan_trans ,f1 sqrt sqrt sqrt sigmoid sqrt sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sigmoid sqrt sqrt ,f0 sqrt sigmoid sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sigmoid sqrt sqrt ,f2 cube sqrt ,f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f18 tanh sqrt]
```

In constructing this feature set:

1. **Complex Transformations**: We used variations like `sigmoid` and `square` with combinations involving sqrt to leverage more non-linear and complex patterns.
2. **Broad Coverage**: Ensured key features like f0 and f2 appear in multiple transformed forms to capture different perspectives on their data.
3. **Unique Combinations**: Introduced transformations like `tanh`, which can help emphasize extreme values and `cube` for further interaction effects.
4. **Efficient Representation**: Reduced redundant complex transformations to maintain computational efficiency while preserving the predictive power.

This approach should deliver a more nuanced representation of the data, enhancing model performance for credit approval prediction tasks.

- Enhanced `f19 sigmoid` transformation is retained from the second example for versatility in feature scaling.
- Removed `f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt` from the first example due to redundancy in excessive square roots, deemed less effective.
- Retained the strong scaling transformations on `f2` due to their widespread application in both examples. 
- Kept `f18 sigmoid sqrt` from the second example for maintaining variety in sigmoid transformations.
- The combination of both examples provides a robust multi-faceted transformation approach without redundancy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-12 11:14:11,239 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the provided examples, we should focus on incorporating diverse transformations, considering scalability, and ensuring we capture non-linear relationships effectively:

Here is a feature set incorporating transformations from both examples:

```
[f0, f4, f5, f1 log, f0 minmax_scaler, f6 sqrt, f2 tanh, f0 sqrt sqrt, f2 sqrt sqrt, f5 sqrt sqrt, f19 sqrt sqrt, f1 log sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f0 tanh, f6 sqrt sqrt, f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f1 log tanh, f19 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f6 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f1 log sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler, f0 sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler, f19 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler, f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler, f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f19 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f0 sqrt tanh, f1 log sqrt minmax_scaler, f1 log square, f5 reciprocalsqrt, f0 * f2, f6 sqrt sqrt sqrt]
```

### Explanation:

- **Maintained Important Features**: Kept many original transformations like `f0 minmax_scaler`, `f1 log`, and several square roots which seem to help capture data spread and scale reduction.
- **Minmax Scaler**: Used frequently for normalization to ensure all feature data starts within the same scale.
- **Tanh**: Introduced to capture non-linear relationships; especially useful in making the model robust to scale and amplification.
- **Log and Sqrt combinations**: Help to compress the scale of the data and bring more stability, especially when combined with minmax scaling.
- **Interaction and Scalability**: Additional interactions like `f0 * f2` are added to uncover interactions between features.
- **Reciprocal Sqrt and Square**: Introduced for additional non-linear variations.

This feature set is designed as such to capture a wide range of transformations, ensuring that varied relationships and patterns in the data are effectively encapsulated, enhancing prediction accuracy for the downstream task.

2026-01-12 11:14:31,539 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, I need to generate a better feature set by considering transformations that may offer improved utility for downstream tasks like predictions. To improve on the initial two sets, I should focus on exploring more complex interactions and combinations of features, while balancing computational efficiency.

Here's an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 log ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt ,f1 log sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt ,f5 sqrt sqrt ,f6 sqrt sqrt ,f11 sqrt sqrt ,f19 sqrt sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f1 log sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f6 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f1 log sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f3 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f14 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f18 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f9 sqrt sqrt ,f1 log sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f6 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f19 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f1 log sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f6 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f14 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f5 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f6 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f19 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f0 sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f2 sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f5 sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f15 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt ,f14 sqrt sqrt ]
```

Explanation of enhancements:
- Added some complex consecutive transformations for selected features while balancing computational cost.
- Emphasized using transformations like `sqrt sqrt` and nested `log sqrt` for more nuanced representations of features that offer dimensionality reduction and potential for better patterns when predicting.
- Adjusted the use of `minmax_scaler` to features which might have high variance to bring their values into a similar range, ensuring they are effectively contribute in models that are sensitive to the scale of input data.

These improvements can provide more complex feature interactions that might capture nuances not directly visible with simple transformations, thus offering potential for improving predictive modeling tasks.

### Explanation:
1. **Inclusion of additional transformations**: I've added `log`, `reciprocal`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and scaling transformations to capture various patterns and distributions. 
2. **Diverse non-linear transformations**: Using `sqrt`, `square`, and compounded transformations to address potential non-linearity.
3. **Scaling transformations**: `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` can help normalize the data, making models potentially more robust.
4. **Combining transformations**: Utilizing both transformations and scaling helps in capturing complex underlying patterns in the data.

**Explanation:**
- Kept transformative approaches such as `sqrt`, `log`, and `minmax_scaler` to handle scaling and normalization, which are generally useful in making input data suitable for machine learning models.
- Gauged combinations like reciprocal followed by `minmax_scaler` that help in addressing non-linearity and preserving distance measures.
- Included some root transformations to stabilize variance and some logarithmic transformations for handling skewness.
- Both feature sets imply the significance of `sqrt` and `minmax_scaler`, thus focusing on features incorporating these operations.
- Emphasized the deep transformations with multiple layers of scaling and logarithmic applications to access more refined and hierarchical characteristics of the data.

- Combines reciprocal, sqrt, cube, log, and tanh operations to capture non-linearity and complex interactions in the data.
- Utilizes ratio operations and multiplication of certain features to introduce interaction terms.
- Applies minmax_scaler and stand_scaler where appropriate to ensure different features are normalized for model training efficiency.
- Uses transformations like `quan_trans`, `cos`, and `sin` to enhance feature richness and possibly capture periodicity or pattern variations.

This feature set includes a variety of transformations that capture different aspects of the data:
- Combination of reciprocal, square, cube, and log functions to account for non-linear relationships
- Interactions between features (e.g., multiplication and addition)
- Scaling transformations (standard scaler, minmax scaler) to ensure features are on a similar scale
- Trigonometric transformations (sin, cos, tanh) to capture periodic patterns or non-linearity.

These transformations can enrich the dataset with more informative features, potentially improving the predictive performance of the downstream task.

```

In this feature set:
- I've included multiple basic transformations (square, log, reciprocal) for several features to capture different non-linear relationships.
- Enhanced complex transformations by combining both square roots, squares, and other operations to offer deeper feature insights.
- Utilized logarithmic transformations and the reciprocal to address skewness or non-linearity.
- Kept a mix of linear and non-linear transformations for versatility in capturing diverse data patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this new feature set, I retained the original features and their transformations from the two provided examples and added a few more transformations to enhance diversity and potential predictive power:

- f9 sqrt: Square root of the squared value from the previous set, making the transformation more suitable for normalized values.
- f3 minmax_scaler: Applying min-max scaling to the cube of f3 from the previous example helps normalize this feature.
- f0 tanh sqrt: Applying hyperbolic tangent followed by square root to f0 introduces a non-linear transformation that can highlight extreme values.
- f5 minmax_scaler sqrt: Both min-max scaling and square root transformation on f5 help normalize and reduce the spread of this feature.
- f10 f14 * sqrt: Incorporating square root after multiplication may balance out and standardize the output range.
- f6 f7 - sqrt: Square root applied after subtraction, capturing instances of smaller differences more noticeably.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
