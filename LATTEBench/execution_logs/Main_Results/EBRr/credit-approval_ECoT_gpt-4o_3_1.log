### Explanation:
1. **`f0, f1, ..., f14`**: Include all original features to maintain the base information.
2. **`f13 f14 *`**: Interaction between `ZipCode` and `Income`. This might capture location-based income variations.
3. **`f14 f1 *`**: Interaction between `Income` and `Age`. Higher age might indicate higher income in a certain range.
4. **`f1 f7 *`**: Interaction between `Age` and `YearsEmployed`. Older individuals tend to have more work experience.
5. **`f8 sqrt f2 *`**: The square root of `PriorDefault` multiplied by `Debt` could highlight the combined impact of default history and financial obligations.
6. **`f14 sigmoid log`**: Log-transformed sigmoid of `Income` provides a non-linear transformation that can be useful for capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

Our aim is to generate meaningful features that can improve model predictions. Considering the given examples, we can extract patterns such as combining features using mathematical operations and transformations. Below is a new feature set:

1. Transform and create interaction features:
   - Combine features using operations: Multiplication, Addition, and transformations like Square, Cube, and Sigmoid.
   - Apply more rigorous transformations on important features like f14 (Income) which seems influential.

Here is the better feature set:

Explanation:

- `f14 f1 *`: Interaction between Income and Age, which might be influential in assessing financial stability.
- `f12 cube`: Citizenship as a categorical feature undergoing a cube transformation can help in identifying subtle patterns.
- `f2 f8 *`: Interaction between Debt and Years Employed could be significant in financial behavior modelling.
- `f9 f10 square`: An interaction between employment status and credit score reflects credit-worthiness influenced by employment.
- `f14 sqrt`: Square root transformation on Income for better scaling.
- `f10 log`: Log transformation on Credit Score could aid in compressing scale variations.

2026-01-17 16:27:01,085 - INFO - llm output = For a better feature set given the examples, we aim to capture meaningful transformations that enhance predictive power. We can focus on creating interactions between features, applying transformations that might reveal hidden relationships, and combining features to exploit nonlinear dependencies. Here's a proposed feature set:

```

```

**Explanation of choices:**

- **Interaction Terms:** Like `f2 f7 *` and `f4 f9 *`, these terms explore relationships that emerge from combining features, especially those directly related to credit characteristics (Years Employed and Prior Default).
  
- **Transformations:** By using transformations like `f5 tanh`, `f8 log`, and `f7 sqrt`, we capture nonlinear relationships and distribute skewed features into more useful representations.

- **Feature Combinations:** Terms like `f13 f14 *` and `f1 f10 *` seek to leverage combinations of demographic and credit score features to explore the potential synergies in predicting credit card success.

- **Scaled and Sigmoid Transform:** Incorporating `f14 minmax_scaler f5 *` and `f14 sigmoid f1 *` scales end user-focused features and interacts them with core demographic features like gender.

This suggested feature set aims to balance domain relevance with mathematical transformations to enrich the data for classification tasks.

```

In this feature set, we've focused on useful transformations (like square, sqrt, tanh, and cube) and interactions between features. We've experimented with applying trigonometric and hyperbolic functions on combinations of existing features which could capture non-linear aspects of the data. These operations can help in capturing complex patterns and dependencies which simple linear models may miss.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:27:29,314 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we can focus on diversifying the transformations applied, capturing non-linear relationships, and considering additional combinations of interactions between features. Here's a proposed feature set:

[f2, f5, f8, f10, f14, f14 cos, f2 square, f5 square, f7 square, f9 square, f10 square, f14 cos square, f14 f2 +, f2 sqrt, f14 sigmoid, f5 sin, f8 sin, f14 cos square sin, f14 quan_trans, f14 minmax_scaler, f5 f2 +, f14 sqrt, f14 log, f2 cube, f8 cube, f2 f5 *, f10 f9 /, f7 tanh, f8 f9 + sin, f5 f10 + sqrt, f14 reciprocal square, f14 f2 * minmax_scaler] 

In this feature set:
- Original features like f2, f5, and f8 are retained for baseline linear characteristics.
- Non-linear transformations such as square, cube, sqrt, sin, cos, tanh, log, and sigmoid are applied to explore non-linear correlations with the target variable.
- Interaction between features is created using operations like addition, multiplication, and division.
- Scaling techniques like minmax_scaler and transformations like quan_trans and reciprocal are used to ensure stability and to capture variations in different scales.

This approach aims to provide a diverse set of engineered features to potentially improve the model's predictive performance.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

In this feature set:
- I've kept existing transformations such as multiplication, division, cube, tanh, and reciprocal operations that can capture nonlinear relationships, interactions, or scale alterations between the features.
- Added `f1 f3 *` as age and married status might interact.
- Added `f2 f7 /`, taking Debt and YearsEmployed as Debt-to-Employment ratio might be insightful.
- Added `f0 f9 +`, combining Gender and CreditScore might yield meaningful insights.
- Added `f9 log` and `f10 tanh` to enhance feature extraction from CreditScore and DriversLicense.
- Used `f6 quan_trans` (quantile transformation) on Ethnicity for another scaling alternative.
- Added `f13 f14 sqrt /`, combining ZipCode and Income by scaling with square root could uncover meaningful interactions.

In this version, I've retained features that utilize transformations of the original features, as these often enhance the information available for prediction tasks by handling non-linearity and scaling. Additionally, by incorporating both reciprocal and multiplicative interactions with f1 (Age), this feature set aims to better capture nuanced patterns in the data. The new feature `f1 square reciprocal` might help capture more complex relationships involving Age, which could be valuable given its continuous nature and potential non-linear relationships with the output.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:27:49,810 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions based on the given examples, we can combine approaches from both and enhance them with additional transformations. Here’s a new feature set:

```
[f2 ,f5 ,f8 ,f10 ,f14 ,f2 square ,f5 square ,f8 square ,f9 square ,f10 square ,f14 sigmoid square ,f2 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f14 sqrt ,f5 sin ,f8 sin ,f2 square sin ,f5 square sin ,f8 square sin ,f10 square sin ,f14 cos sin ,f10 tanh ,f14 tanh ,f14 quan_trans ,f14 cube ,f5 f2 + ,f14 log]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Basic Features:** Keep commonly transformed features like `f2`, `f5`, `f8`, `f10`, and `f14`, which are present in both sets.
2. **Squared Features:** Retain squared versions to capture the non-linear relationships for `f2`, `f5`, `f8`, `f9`, and `f10`.
3. **Advanced Non-linear Transformations:** Implement `f14 sigmoid square`, `f14 tanh`, `f14 cube`, and `f14 cos sin` to capture complex non-linear patterns.
4. **Root Transformation:** Apply square roots, which can moderate the scale and distribution of numeric features like `f2`, `f5`, `f8`, `f10`, and `f14`.
5. **Trigonometric Sin Transformations:** For capturing cyclical patterns: `f5 sin`, `f8 sin`, and relevant squared versions.
6. **Feature Combination and Interaction:** Introduce feature interaction like `f5 f2 +`.
7. **Log Transformation:** Apply log transformation on `f14` which can be useful for highly skewed distributions and capturing multiplicative behavior.

This approach provides a comprehensive transformation strategy, leveraging hints from the previous examples, and introduces additional variety in transformations to potentially uncover stronger predictive relationships.

Explanation:
1. **`f14 sigmoid`**: Applying a sigmoid transformation to the income could help to constrain income values within a range that is more interpretable and useful for non-linear models.
2. **`f13 sqrt`**: The square root of zip codes might reveal regional insights while damping extreme differences.
3. **`f8 log`**: Applying a log transformation to `YearsEmployed` can help with skewed data distributions, providing a more normalized feature for models to work with.

```

In this new feature set:
- Added `f3 f14 *` to capture interaction patterns between the debt and income, which could be predictive of credit card success.
- Introduced `f4 f13 sin` to potentially capture nonlinear effects between marital status and ZipCode, representative of socioeconomic factors.
- Added `f5 log` to model the debt feature on a logarithmic scale, as financial data often benefits from such transformation.
- Introduced `f10 f13 *` to explore interactions between credit score and ZipCode.
- Used `f14 tanh` to explore the saturation effect for the income feature, which might stabilize outliers or high values.

These transformations aim to create features that can improve the predictive power by capturing complex relationships within the data.

### Explanation:
- **Fenumbers and Squares**: Retain these for capturing basic non-linear relationships and variabilities.
- **Combinations and Interactions**: Introduces combinations through interaction terms and non-linear transformations ("f1 f3 *", "f1 tanh")—these can help model complex dependencies.
- **Feature Transformations**: Utilize `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `minmax_scaler` for non-linear scaling and distribution transformation, potentially capturing different response curves.
- **Rednessance Reduction**: A reduction in overly complex and redundant transformations that may increase noise, focusing instead on potentially more relevant transformations.

This set captures potential complexities and underlying relationships more effectively for the downstream predictive task.

**Rationale for feature transformations:**
- **`f4 square`**: Squaring Married status can help emphasize distinctions between single/divorced/etc and married people, which can be important given socioeconomic differences.
- **`f9 log`**: Log transformation of employment status might reduce skewness in the distribution, giving more weight to the implications of being employed.
- **`f8 reciprocal`**: Reciprocal transformation of PriorDefaults emphasizes the distinction between no default and prior defaults by changing the scale.
- **`f12 stand_scaler`**: Standard scaling of Citizenship can be appropriate for handling categorical features numerically, especially where citizenship status impacts application success.
- **`f0 tanh`** and **`f1 sigmoid`**: These transformations on Gender and Age, respectively, can help compress the range, make relationships non-linear, and possibly highlight interactions in the latent space.

This feature set includes:

- Basic features for interpretability and non-transformed use.
- Non-linear transformations such as `cube`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `log`, and `reciprocal` which can capture non-linear relationships.
- Interaction terms like `f0 f1 *` and `f4 f5 +` which allow for capturing interaction effects.
- Scaling with `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for features like `f10`, which is useful when dealing with models sensitive to feature scaling.
- Combinations of transformations and interactions, such as `f1 f14 cos *` and `f8 f3 tanh`, to explore complex relationships potentially improving model performance.
- More high-order and complex transformations to increase the potential feature representation, such as `f2 f3 /` and `f9 f4 sqrt /`.

Keep in mind the selection and effectiveness of these features might also depend on the nature of the predictive model and data distribution, so it's crucial to evaluate them using validation methods.

Let's aim for transformations that can leverage the variety of relationships between features.

Here is a proposed new feature set:

```
[f2, f8, f10, f14 f1 *, f7 sin, f8 sin, f10 tanh, f14 f1 * sin, f6 sin sin, f14 cube sin sin, f14 f1 * sin sin, f14 * f1 sqrt, f14 stand_scaler sin sin, f8 f10 *, f2 stand_scaler, f2 tanh, f2 sqrt, f14 stand_scaler sin sin sin, f14 f1 * reciprocal, f13 f14 cube sin sin sin, f14 * f13 sqrt, f14 f0 f2 * *, f1 reciprocal minmax_scaler, f14 f8 log, f14 sqrt, f1 reciprocal reciprocal sin reciprocal sqrt, f14 / f14 minmax_scaler, f1 square reciprocal, f1 reciprocal quant_trans]
```

This feature set tries to balance between transform complexity and capturing multifaceted interactions while still using varied operations and transformations that can potentially open up complex relationships in the dataset:
1. Leverage transformations like sin, tanh, and sqrt, which can capture non-linear dependencies.
2. Utilize operations that relate features (e.g., multiplications like `f14 * f2 * f0`) to explore feature interactions.
3. Introduce scaling and logarithmic transformations that can handle skewness and normalize feature distributions.

#### Explanation:
- Introduced feature interactions (e.g., `f1 f6 /`, `f1 f2 * sqrt`) to model relationships between features such as age and employment.
- Explored nonlinear transformations with `sqrt`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` to capture complex patterns in the data.
- Used `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and `square` selectively to focus on specific ranges and behaviors.
- Enhanced complexity with interactions involving multiplication (`f13 f7 f9 * /`, `f6 f3 + reciprocal`) to fit the underlying distribution better.
- Base feature transformations (`minmax_scaler`, `tanh`) are preserved from successful previous examples to ensure the stability of the model training process. 

This set aims to optimize the modeling of feature relationships and potential nonlinearities, likely improving prediction performance for the task.

2026-01-17 16:28:42,037 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples and considering the goal of using feature transformations to generate a more effective feature set for predicting credit card application success, I will combine the ideas of various transformations and leverage a mix of polynomial, scaling, and non-linear transformations to create a new feature set. Each transformation aims to capture different relationships and interactions within the data.

Here's the new, improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 minmax_scaler, f2 square, f7 cube, f8 stand_scaler, f9 sqrt, f10 log, f3 * f14, f5 + f7, f6 tanh, f12 cos]
```

Explanation:
1. **f0 to f14**: Retain all original features to capture baseline information.
2. **f14 minmax_scaler**: Scale `f14` to a standardized range to help models that are sensitive to feature scales.
3. **f2 square**: Square transformation of `f2` to capture quadratic relationships.
4. **f7 cube**: Cube transformation of `f7` to capture more complex, non-linear relationships.
5. **f8 stand_scaler**: Standardize `f8` to mean = 0, std = 1, helping models sensitive to scale.
6. **f9 sqrt**: Square root transformation of `f9` to reduce skewness.
7. **f10 log**: Log transformation of `f10` to handle potential skewness and outliers.
8. **f3 * f14**: Interaction between `f3` and `f14` to capture their combined effect.
9. **f5 + f7**: Summation of `f5` and `f7` to consider their joint significance.
10. **f6 tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent transformation of `f6` for capturing its non-linear relationships and suppressing outliers.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Explanation:
- The first 15 features remain the same as they represent the original features.
- `f13 f14 *`: This feature captures the interaction between the `ZipCode` and `Income`, which might reveal useful information regarding geographic income patterns.
- `f14 minmax_scaler`: Scaling the `Income` to a min-max range can normalize the influence of income differences on predictions.
- `f13 f14 +`: Adding `ZipCode` and `Income` could capture a simple sum that might distinguish areas with specific income ranges.
- `f8 f13 /`: Dividing `PriorDefault` by `ZipCode` helps introduce a potentially meaningful ratio, interpreting default behavior concerning geographic clusters.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:28:59,773 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we will focus on transformations that can potentially capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features that might contribute to the prediction task. Let's explore a combination of transformations and operations that seem promising:

1. Focus on the balance of statistical scaling methods to ensure variables maintain interpretability and effectiveness:
   - Use `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans` to standardize feature distributions.

2. Introduce mathematical transformations that can capture non-linear relationships:
   - Employ `cos`, `sin`, `tanh`, and `sigmoid` for their non-linear characteristics.
   - Use `sqrt`, `square`, `cube`, and `log` to manipulate feature magnitude or variance.

3. Establish meaningful interactions between features:
   - Consider building interactions or ratios between promising features that might capture deeper financial behaviors.

Combining these principles, here's the improved feature set:

- `f5 f8 tanh *`: Captures the interaction between these two features to outline potential financial stress and reliability through the hyperbolic tangent.
- `f10 f14 / sqrt`: Encodes ratio scaling between credit and income, revealing stress points in financial aptitude.
- `f7 f9 log +`: Combines employment and the impact of prior defaults, offering insights into creditworthiness.

Enhancements made:

- It builds on the squared transformations of relevant features, which helps in capturing non-linear relationships.
- Additional operations include summing, multiplying, and sigmoid of specific features that could be strongly predictive when combined and transformed.
- The division by `f6 + 1` in `f5 / (f6 + 1)` ensures we avoid division by zero issues while capturing a potential ratio-based feature.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Keep core features (f1, f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f14):** These are baseline features potentially helpful for predictive modeling.
2. **Min-max scaling:** Maintaining f14 minmax_scaler from the second set is useful as min-max scaling can help standardize the range.
3. **Sigmoid Transformation:** Some sigmoids from the second set are preserved because they smooth out large outliers and bring features into a 0-1 range, which can make the model more robust.
4. **Tanh Transformation:** Swapping some sigmoids for tanh as tanh is similar but provides a mean of zero which can be beneficial for some models.
5. **Complex Transformations:** Removed transformations like `sigmoid sigmoid` because they might not add much value. Similarly, complex operations like cube, reciprocal, etc., are omitted unless their predictive value is specifically justified.

This approach aims to blend feature standardization and smooth non-linear transformations while maintaining readability and improved modeling performance.

1. **Combination and Interaction Terms**: Including terms like `f1 f2 *`, `f10 reciprocal`, and `f0 f1 f3 * /` to capture potential multiplicative or interaction effects between features that may be indicative of successful credit card applications.

2. **Transformations**: Applying transformations like `f2 log`, `f14 sqrt`, `f8 cube`, and `f9 sigmoid`, which can help in normalizing data or capturing nonlinear relationships.

3. **Scaling**: Using `f2 stand_scaler` to standardize features, making them more comparable and possibly enhancing model performance.

4. **Nonlinear Activation Functions**: Including `f14 sin`, `f1 tanh`, and `f14 f6 tanh` to effectively capture nonlinearities in the data, which linear models may miss.

By incorporating potential interaction terms, non-linear transformations, and scaling, we can aim for a feature set that better captures the underlying data structure and improves prediction accuracy for the credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:29:22,548 - INFO - llm output = To design a better feature set based on the provided examples, we should aim for a transformation that might create meaningful interactions and potentially capture underlying patterns more effectively for the credit card application success prediction task. Here's a proposed feature set:

```

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Include Original Features**: Retaining all features can help preserve important information.
2. **Interaction Terms**:
   - `f13 f14 *`, `f14 f1 *`: These capture interactions between citizenship, income, and gender and age, potentially revealing combined effects related to wealth and demographic factors.
   - `f5 f10 +`: Combining debt and credit score could be insightful, as they are both related to financial stability.
   - `f8 f14 *`: Combining years employed with income can highlight stability and earning potential.
   - `f2 f8 /`: Applying employment history relative to age might expose patterns in employment stability versus expected career stage.
3. **Non-linear transformations**:
   - `f14 cube`: Enhances non-linear effects of income, potentially exposing high-income discrepancies.
   - `f14 minmax_scaler`: Normalizes income to magnify impact in various scenarios.
   - `f9 reciprocal`: Converts previous default into a scale that may highlight absolute risks from past behavior.
   - `f10 cos`: Uses cosine on credit score to examine periodic or outlier behavior in financial metrics.

This transformation aims to uncover both explicit interactions and subtle non-linear shifts in features relevant to predicting successful credit card applications.

Considering the operations provided and examples of feature sets, I suggest creating a new set that maintains simplicity but explores potentially informative transformations.

Here's the proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f13 square ,f2 sqrt ,f8 cube]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Retain original features (`f0` to `f14`)**: It is important to maintain access to the original features for straightforward interpretation and baseline modeling.

2. **Transformations applied:**

   - **`f14 minmax_scaler`**: Applying min-max scaling to `f14` (Income) aligns with the goal of reducing variance while keeping income as a relevant predictive feature. This operation helps handle large differences across income values.

   - **`f13 square`**: Squaring `f13` (ZipCode) might seem unusual, but given its wide range and potential encoding of geographic socio-economic factors, adding this squared feature might capture nuanced relations.

   - **`f2 sqrt`**: Applying square root transformation on `f2` (Debt) helps manage skewness and could reveal relationships between lower levels of debt and credit card approval.

   - **`f8 cube`**: Cubing `f8` (YearsEmployed) could enhance the discrimination of employment history, especially distinguishing those with extended employment periods.

The choice of transformations balances enhancing model interpretability with capturing complex relations inherent in the data. The aim is to create new features that might enrich the dataset with information valuable for predicting success in credit card applications.

2026-01-17 16:29:36,480 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that builds upon the two given sets while aiming for improved prediction performance, we'll combine the most promising transformations from each and introduce some innovations. Let's consider useful mathematical transformations and feature interactions that could capture underlying relationships beneficial for predicting credit card application success.

Here's the proposed feature transformation set:

```plaintext
[f2, f5, f8, f10, f14, f2 square, f5 sqrt, f14 cos, f8 sin, f2 tanh, f10 reciprocal, f5 f14 *, f8 f10 +, f7 square, f14 cos f5 sqrt *, f2 f8 -, f2 sqrt f10 reciprocal *, f14 sigmoid, f9 log, f8 f5 sin *, f14 quan_trans, f14 minmax_scaler, f14 f2 + sin, f5 f2 +, f2 f10 /, f14 tanh f5 sin *]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Basic Feature Retention**: Retain fundamental features like `f2`, `f5`, `f8`, `f10`, `f14` as they represent key numeric variables like Debt, Married, PriorDefault, and Income from the original dataset.

2. **Polynomial Transformations**: Utilize `square`, `sqrt`, and `cos` on select features to capture non-linear relationships.

3. **Trigonometric and Logarithmic Functions**: Incorporate `sin`, `tanh`, and `log` transformations which might help with periodicity and scale invariance.

4. **Combinations of Transformed Features**: Combine transformed features via multiplication and addition to explore latent interactions, e.g., `f5 f14 *`, `f8 f10 +`.

5. **Advanced Transformations**: Use transformations such as `sigmoid` for non-linear scaling and `reciprocal` for inverse relationships, aiming to capture varying influences on credit approval.

6. **Quantile and Min-Max Scaling**: Apply `quan_trans` and `minmax_scaler` as robust scaling methods that enhance feature numerical properties without sensitivity to outliers.

These transformations are designed to reveal new patterns that might improve predictive accuracy in determining successful credit card applications. The feature interactions and transformations seek to synthesize information that was less apparent in the raw data.

It is generally clearer and might offer better interpretability and performance when working with models sensitive to feature understanding, such as linear models or certain tree algorithms.

However, to improve upon them by taking advantage of non-linear transformations, I've crafted this new feature set, combining simplicity with potential non-linear insights:

```
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f11, f12, f13, f14, f2 log, f8 log, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f7 f8 * log, f10 minmax_scaler sin, f14 cube sin, f2 f14 / tanh, f14 f1 * log]
```

Here's the breakdown of this better feature set:

- Retained key original features for interpretability and understanding of model performance.
- Incorporated logarithm and standard scaling transforms to normalize skewed features and aid models that assume normality.
- Used multiplication and transformation combinations to uncover potential interactions, such as `f7 f8 * log`.
- Introduced the `minmax_scaler` for normalizing the range of features like `f10`.
- Applied non-linear transformations such as `sin`, `tanh`, and `cube` on select features to capture non-linear patterns that might contribute to distinguishing successful credit card applicants.

2026-01-17 16:29:48,874 - INFO - llm output = Based on the previous feature sets and transformations, the aim is to enhance the predictive capability by exploring diverse transformations. Let’s consider transformations that capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features which often boost predictive power in models. Given that the latter feature set focused heavily on powers and squares, we can include exponential transformations, interactions, and nonlinear scaling in this better feature set.

Here is the proposed feature set:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f2 minmax_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f7 sqrt, f9 log, f10 tanh, f14 cube, f3 * f5, f6 + f9, f8 tanh, f12 sin, f2 * f8, f5 reciprocal, f7 cube square, f10 / f9, f14 exp] 

This feature set includes:
- Min-Max and Standard Scaling for normalizing features.
- Square root and logarithmic transformations for reducing skewness.
- Tanh and sine transformations to capture cyclic patterns.
- Interactions between features to discover potential relationships.
- Exponential and reciprocal transformations for nonlinear effects.
- Combinations of cube and square operations to explore high-degree polynomial patterns.

The idea is to cover a broad range of transformations to ensure diverse representation of the data, which can reveal complex patterns useful for credit card application prediction.

2026-01-17 16:29:52,034 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, the goal is to create a feature set that leverages transformations to improve predictive performance. The latter set in the examples seems to apply diverse transformations like min-max scaling and standard scaling, which are effective for normalization, alongside squaring certain features, which can help capture non-linear relationships.

Given this context, a better feature set could be:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 minmax_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f10 log, f2 reciprocal, f9 sqrt]

Explanation of choices:
1. **f14 minmax_scaler:** Retains normalization of income, which can have a wide range.
2. **f8 stand_scaler:** Standardizes prior defaults due to binary values.
3. **f10 log:** Log transformation on credit score helps manage skew.
4. **f2 reciprocal:** Reciprocals can transform distributions for heavily skewed data like debt.
5. **f9 sqrt:** Square root scaling on employment helps to manage outlier effects or uneven distributions. 

These transformations are intended to optimize feature scaling and capture non-linear patterns that may be pertinent in a credit card application prediction context.

- **Non-linear Transformations:** Including `square`, `sqrt`, and `cos`, as these transformations can capture non-linear relationships that linear models might miss.
- **Pairwise Interactions:** Including interactions such as f5 f10 *, f8 f2 *, and f2 f5 + captures relationships between pairs of features, potentially revealing more about how they contribute to the outcome together.
- **Distribution Transformations:** `quant_trans`, `minmax_scaler`, and `sigmoid` are included to adjust distribution characteristics which help some machine learning algorithms to perform better.

2026-01-17 16:30:08,013 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations and examples, I'll aim to create a new feature set that incorporates useful transformations while emphasizing non-linear relationships, interactions, and scaling to improve predictive power for this classification task.

Here's the proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 cos, f2 square, f5 square, f8 square, f10 square, f14 cos square, f14 f2 +, f2 sqrt, f14 minmax_scaler, f5 sin, f8 sin, f9 sin, f14 sigmoid, f10 tanh, f0 f6 *, f3 f7 *, f8 square sin, f14 cube, f10 f2 * sqrt, f5 f6 tanh, f7 f2 f6 log * +]
```

**Explanations for New Transformations:**

1. **Interactions**:
   - `f0 f6 *`: Interaction between gender and employment to capture gender-specific employment effects.
   - `f3 f7 *`: Interaction between marital status and years employed which could capture effects like dual-income households.

2. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - `f14 minmax_scaler`: Scaling of income for easier capture of variations in income level.
   - `f10 f2 * sqrt`: Interaction between credit score and age, square root transformation to reduce skewness and emphasize differences with age.
   - `f7 f2 f6 log * +`: Complex interaction involving years employed, age, and industry (where industry could be encoded numerically), aiming to capture interaction effects modifying years of employment by log-transformed effects of age and industry.

Overall, the new feature set takes into account basic transformations, polynomial features, scaling standardizations, trigonometric transformations, and interactions to potentially extract richer patterns from the data, enhancing machine learning models' ability to discriminate successful vs. unsuccessful credit card applicants.
