you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:
- **Retained Transformed Features**: We keep several transformed features from the previous sets as they involve powerful transformations like subtraction (which can highlight relative differences), squares, and scaling (like `stand_scaler` for normalization). They prepare the features for a model that benefits from normalized input.
  
- **Newly Introduced Transformations**:
  - `f1 sqrt`: Square root to reduce the impact of larger values.
  - `f7 f6 /`, `f3 f4 /`, `f10 f5 /`: Ratios (divisions) of features to capture relationships between them.
  - `f14 f3 *`, `f14 f12 /`: Multiplication and division to form interaction terms.
  - `f16 f8 /`: Another interaction ratio.
  - `f0 minmax_scaler f5 sin *`: Scaled feature combined with sine transformation to capture non-linear effects.

This improved feature set preserves robust transformations while introducing interactions that can be significant for predictive modeling in the context of software defect prediction.

In this feature set:
- I have retained and slightly modified combinations that utilize trigonometric and scaling functions to capture complex interactions, especially involving `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `quan_trans` transformations.
- I included a combination of cube, sqrt, and reciprocal for additional complexity and interaction terms with logarithmic transformations.
- By using products and summations of transformed features, the resulting set is intended to provide better spatial separation of the defects (presence or absence).

This approach aims to balance varied feature transformations to capture more nuanced relationships in the data set without unnecessary complexity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Combining Features**: Utilized multiplications between selected features to capture interactions, such as `f6 f9 *` and `f8 f5 *`, which can drive additional insights regarding complexity and code operations.
   
2. **Non-linear Transformations**:
   - **Sigmoid**: Applied to track binary-like or saturation effects across features.
   - **Square and Square root**: Used to model non-linear relationships and variance; applied in conjunction with sigmoid in some cases to add depth to transformation.
   
3. **Different Non-linear Functions**: 
   - **Tanh**: Good for capturing variance in distributions that behave like a normal distribution but require slightly different scaling.
  
4. **Feature coverage**: Ensured coverage of essential features from original feature list to leverage potential linear relationships.

5. **Order of Operations**: Ensured transformations were applied in a manner that captured feature importance and interaction effectively. 

This engineered feature set should capture both linear and non-linear relationships, improve interaction detection, and ultimately lead to better predictive performance for software defect detection.

2026-01-17 17:34:18,432 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, it seems that we are encouraged to engineer additional features using various transformations. The latter example involving the `sigmoid` transformation applies it to a wider range of features, while the previous example used a more diverse set of transformations to explore non-linear relationships, interactions, and scaling.

To create a better feature set, it would be beneficial to combine both approaches, utilizing a variety of transformations to capture different aspects of the data while ensuring coverage across many features. Here's a new feature set that considers diverse transformations applied across as many relevant features as possible:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

To improve upon the given feature sets for the KC1 Software defect prediction task, it's important to consider creating features that provide more insight into complexity, and effort, and have a better correlation with software defects. Additionally, we can introduce normalization and transformation techniques to ensure the features are better conditioned for a predictive model.

Here's a new feature set, derived from the given examples, that focuses on enhancing the interpretability and potential predictive power:

```text
[f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f18 ,f9 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f11 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f1 f9 / ,f2 f10 / ,f3 f11 / ,f0 f18 / ,f4 f19 / ,f7 f20 / ,f14 f19 / ,f15 f10 / ,f16 f18 / ,f17 f20 / ,f5 tanh f8 / ,f0 f9 log ,f1 f10 log ,f2 f11 log ,f3 f18 log ,f4 f19 log ,f6 f9 log ,f13 f19 log ,f14 f10 log ,f15 f18 log ,f16 f20 log ,f18 f20 log ,f19 f18 log ,f20 f19 log ,f5 tanh f8 log ,f0 f9 log square ,f1 f10 log square ,f2 f11 log square ,f3 f18 log square ,f4 f19 log square ,f6 f9 log square ,f13 f19 log square ,f14 f10 log square ,f15 f18 log square ,f16 f20 log square ,f8 square ,f10 square ,f6 square]
```
  
This new feature set attempts to:
1. Retain key features likely related to defect likelihood, such as execution time and operator/operand complexity.
2. Introduce square roots to stabilize variance and combat skewness of large magnitude features.
3. Utilize feature ratios to capture proportional relationships.
4. Apply logarithms to stabilize high variance in features, which is crucial for models sensitive to extreme values.
5. Combine non-linear transformations such as `tanh` for feature scaling, further exposing intricate relationships between features.
6. Square the features after applying log to them, to potentially capture interactive effects between multiplicative relationships. 

This constructed feature set leverages transformations designed to make each feature more robust, emphasizing significant mathematical relationships that could enhance prediction accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:34:37,834 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, the task is to enhance the feature set by applying various transformations that could potentially improve the performance of a predictive model for software defect prediction. Here's a new feature set that leverages the transformations provided in the examples, while also aiming to be methodologically sound in creating interactions and non-linear transformations that might capture underlying patterns in the data:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f7 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f11 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f13 sqrt ,f14 sqrt ,f15 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f10 sigmoid ,f11 sigmoid ,f12 sigmoid ,f3 square ,f7 square ,f8 square ,f9 square ,f10 square ,f12 square ,f16 square ,f19 square ,f8 tanh square ,f9 tanh square ,f10 tanh square ,f11 tanh square ,f12 tanh square ,f17 tanh square ,f18 tanh square ,f19 tanh square ,f6 f9 * ,f8 f5 * ,f3 f4 + f5 * ,f1 f2 - f6 /]
```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Transforms**: Include the original features and their square and cube versions to capture non-linear relationships. 
- **Sigmoid and Tanh**: These transformations are useful for scaling and squeezing the values into specific ranges, which might help with models sensitive to the scale of inputs, like neural networks.
- **Square and Square Root**: Applied selectively, especially to those features that might represent 'counts' or 'volumes', to capture the relationship.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:34:47,380 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set representation based on the given examples, we should focus on efficiently capturing the non-linear relationships and interactions between the features while reducing dimensions when possible. One way is to combine existing features using mathematical operations and transformations that can reveal hidden patterns impacting the defect prediction.

Here's a new feature set suggestion that merges ideas and transformations from the given examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 f9 *, f4 f6 +, f1 f3 /, f7 f0 *, f10 cube, f11 sqrt, f13 f14 + f15 *, f16 log, f17 reciprocal, f18 square, f19 sigmoid, f9 minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
- **`f5 f9 *`**: Measures the interaction between Halstead 'volume' and 'effort', reflecting how intense and costly code components are.
- **`f4 f6 +`**: Combines operators-operands with the program length, representing complexity-related metrics impacting software defects.
- **`f1 f3 /`**: Gets the ratio of cyclomatic to design complexity, highlighting structural issues in code logic.
- **`f7 f0 *`**: Multiplies Halstead 'difficulty' with the line count for reflecting overall code challenges.
- **`f10 cube`**: Utilizes cubing as a non-linear transformation for Halstead 'b' metric, capturing distribution patterns in less significant features.
- **`f11 sqrt`**: Applies square root to Halstead's time estimator, stabilizing variances in time predictions.
- **`f13 f14 + f15 *`**: Adds comment and blank lines, then multiplies with code and comment lines, merging different types of lines for code readability representation.
- **`f16 log`**: Logs unique operators, smoothing their distribution while preserving their informational essence.
- **`f17 reciprocal`**: Uses reciprocal on unique operands to evaluate variance influence in defect predictions.
- **`f18 square`**: Squares the total operators, acknowledging their multiplicatory impacts in isolation.
- **`f19 sigmoid`**: Deploys a sigmoid transformation on total operands, bounding values for a probability-like shape reflecting operand interaction influence.
- **`f9 minmax_scaler`**: Normalizes Halstead's difficulty within the range [0, 1], addressing extremities and aiding convergence in models.

This feature set captures complexity, effort interactions, code challenge reflections, and intrinsic metric behaviors that align with software defect prediction tasks.

2026-01-17 17:34:53,208 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples and the operations allowed, let's construct a better feature set that might be more useful for the downstream prediction task. Given the second set’s use of non-linear transformations like `sigmoid`, `square`, and `sqrt`, these can help in capturing complex relationships in the data. The task is to devise new combinations incorporating these transformations for increased utility in predictions:

In this new feature set:
- We include original features `f4` to `f19` and their sigmoid transforms based on their potential to capture linear and non-linear patterns.
- Quadratic (`square`) and sigmoid transformations are applied on particular features that might capture interactions, non-linearity, or distinct feature scaling.
- `f1 sqrt f13 sqrt +` and similar new combinations aim to capture additional variance and relationships through non-linear transformation and interaction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:35:11,232 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided and aiming to create a more effective feature set, we can look for transformations that might provide greater insight into the defect prediction task. 

The first example suggests simply adding `f5` to various features, which is straightforward but possibly not very powerful. The latter includes complex feature interactions with operations such as `sigmoid`, `square`, `sqrt`, and `quan_trans`, suggesting the capture of nonlinear relationships between features. Building on these concepts, an advantageous approach is to explore different mathematical transformations and feature combinations that could unveil underlying patterns between software metrics and defect presence.

Here is an alternative feature set that combines and transforms the features in a novel and potentially more insightful way:

```plaintext
[f9 ,f11 ,f7 tanh ,f8 cube ,f11 log ,f9 log sqrt ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt f5 / ,f9 f6 / ,f9 f16 / ,f9 f19 / ,f9 f7 tanh / ,f9 f8 tanh / ,f9 f19 tanh / ,f9 f6 cube / ,f9 f10 cube / ,f9 f12 cube / ,f9 f6 tanh cube / ,f9 f7 tanh cube / ,f9 f8 tanh cube / ,f9 f10 tanh cube / ,f9 f9 log sqrt / ,f9 f9 minmax_scaler / ,f9 sqrt f5 / cube ,f9 log sqrt cube ,f8 cube cube ,f9 minmax_scaler cube ,f9 f6 tanh cube / cube ,f9 f8 tanh cube / cube ,f9 f9 log sqrt / cube ,f9 f16 tanh cube / cube ,f9 f18 tanh cube / cube ,f9 f19 tanh cube / cube ,f9 f4 tanh / cube ,f9 f6 tanh / cube ,f9 f6 cube / cube ,f9 f8 tanh / cube ,f9 f9 minmax_scaler / cube ,f9 f17 tanh / cube ,f9 f6 / cube ,f9 f16 / cube ,f9 f19 / cube ,f11 log cube ,f9 cube]
```

This feature set incorporates the following concepts:

- Using nonlinear transformations (`tanh`, `cube`, `log`, `minmax_scaler`) to capture more complex relationships among the features.
- Combining features through multiplication to represent interactions.
- Using division to normalize certain interactions between features.
- Squaring and cubing operations to capture higher-order interactions and effects.

These transformations might help to uncover deeper insights into how various software metrics affect defect rates, potentially improving prediction performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:
- **Preserved Basics:** Keep the original features (`f0` to `f19`), ensuring all original data is accessible for modeling.
- **Sigmoid and Square Transformations:** Apply sigmoid and square transformations to many features to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Combining Operations:** Use combination strategies such as sums, products, and compositions of transformations (e.g., `f5 f11 +`, `f5 f11 + square`, and `f6 f8 *`) to create enriched features.
- **Complex Features:** Introduce complex features that may capture interactions and non-linear effects, such as `f2 f3 + sqrt`, and `f5 f9 square + sigmoid`.
- **Utilized Repeated Squaring:** Features like `f9` and `f5 f11 +` are raised to the power of two more than once to bring out polynomial relationships.

This structured set aims to enhance the model's capacity to capture the complexities in the defect prediction task by leveraging both simple and more intricate transformations and interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:35:34,510 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two sets of feature transformations you provided, the latter set introduces a greater variety of interactions between the features with the inclusion of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions and also emphasizes interactions using the \(f11\) feature through addition. This approach suggests exploration through interactions which can potentially capture more complex patterns in the data. 

To generate a better set, we should focus on broadening the types of operations applied and ensuring a mix of feature interactions and non-linear transformations. Here is an improved feature set proposal, incorporating ideas from both examples:

```
[f6 f11 + ,f8 f11 + ,f7 f2 f11 + * ,f7 f19 f11 + * ,f7 f7 sin f11 + * ,f6 sin f6 sin * ,f6 sin f12 f11 + * ,f6 sin f13 f11 + * ,f6 sin f17 f11 + * ,f6 sin f16 sin f11 + * ,f6 f11 + f15 f11 + * ,f8 f11 + f8 f11 + * ,f13 f11 + f6 f11 + * ,f14 f11 + f6 sin * ,f14 f11 + f18 sin f11 + * ,f15 f11 + f20 sin f11 + * ,f16 f11 + f2 f11 + * ,f17 f11 + f6 sin * ,f17 f11 + f17 f11 + * ,f19 f11 + f13 f11 + * ,f8 sin f11 + f7 f11 + * ,f8 sin f11 + f14 f11 + * ,f8 sin f11 + f20 sin f11 + * ,f10 sin f11 + f10 f11 + * ,f8 square f15 sin f11 + *, f4 f12 / ,f9 log f7 * ,f9 f10 log + sqrt ,f5 f19 reciprocal + f11 / ,f3 tanh f14 * ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler f13 *]
```

This enhanced feature set includes more variety in non-linear transformations (logarithmic, reciprocal, scaling) combined with interactions and existing operations involving trigonometric functions, ensuring a versatile approach to capturing the non-linearities in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here is a refined and improved feature set:

```

### Explanation:
- **Base Features:** Keeps all the original features ([f0, f1, ..., f20]) to ensure that no potentially critical information is lost.
- **Feature Interactions:**
  - `f5 f9 *`: Product of Halstead 'volume' and Halstead 'effort', which could signal complex code requiring high effort.
  - `f4 f7 +`: Sum of Halstead total operators + operands and Halstead 'difficulty'.
  - `f1 f3 /`: Division of McCabe 'cyclomatic complexity' by McCabe 'design complexity', potentially indicating complexity per design unit.
  - `f6 f0 *`: Multiplication of Halstead 'program length' and line count of code, finding correlations in code length.
- **Non-linear transformations:**
  - Employ transformations like `cube`, `sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, `square`, `sigmoid`, `tanh` to model non-linear relationships.
  - `f10 cube`, `f12 cube`: Cubic transformation to focus on extreme values or amplify differences.
  - `f11 sqrt`, `f16 log`, `f17 reciprocal`: Incorporate different perspectives on data magnitude.
- **Scaling and Other Transformations:**
  - `f9 minmax_scaler`: Scaling effort could help bring features to a uniform scale.
  - Additional interactions such as `f2 f8 /` and `f20 tanh`: Taking advantage of more relationships between features and their hyperbolic tendencies.

Explanation of the improved feature set:

1. **Square Root Transformations:** Retained from the second example for potentially non-linear data patterns.
   
2. **Additive Combinations:** Kept only the essential additive transformations from the first set to augment specific features with `f5` (such as `f10`, which are central in defect prediction).

3. **Non-linear Transformations:** Included `sigmoid` on selected features for variance reduction and to learn saturation points, while retaining `tanh` for similar reasons on others.

4. **Squared Features:** Feature squaring (e.g., `f9`, `f16`, `f19`) can help capture interactions, particularly if relationships have quadratic characteristics.

5. **Complex Interactions:** Included complex interactions (e.g., `f3 f4 + f5 *`) to capture multilinear relationships or dependencies.

By balancing transformation types — additive combinations, non-linear transformations (sigmoid, tanh), and interactions — this feature set aims to offer flexibility, capture a range of feature interactions, and uncover non-linearities that may be crucial for predicting software defects.

Here's an enhanced feature set that builds upon the provided examples:

```
[f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f16, f17, f18, f19, f1 sigmoid, f4 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f7 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f14 sigmoid, f16 sigmoid, f17 sigmoid, f18 sigmoid, f19 sigmoid, f6 square, f7 square, f8 square, f10 square, f12 square, f16 square, f17 square, f18 square, f19 square, f6 sigmoid square, f7 sigmoid square, f8 sigmoid square, f10 sigmoid square, f12 sigmoid square, f16 sigmoid square, f17 sigmoid square, f18 sigmoid square, f19 sigmoid square, f11 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, f9 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f5 f11 *, f9 f10 /, f0 f1 + square, f3 log, f13 cube, f5 f6 + f7 *, f20 tanh, f11 f8 + f9 sqrt *, f6 f17 * f19 /, f7 f18 tanh +]
```

In this enhanced feature set:
- We've kept the diverse transformations including `sigmoid`, `square`, `sqrt`, `log`, `cube`, and `tanh`.
- New interactions such as `f11 f8 + f9 sqrt *` and `f6 f17 * f19 /` have been introduced to explore complex relationships between the features.
- The inclusion of `tanh`, cube, and div/mul interactions for certain features covers non-linear transformations to capture underlying patterns in the data, which might be useful in defect predictions.

```

Explanation of some transformations:
- Combinations like `f1 f2 +` and `f4 f6 -` capture interactions between different features which might highlight certain patterns useful for defect prediction.
- Operations such as `cube`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `log` help in normalizing or emphasizing certain features, making them more suitable for models that benefit from such non-linear transformations.
- Including `minmax_scaler` and operations like `f18 f19 + f20 *` adds diversity and depth to the feature set by normalizing ranges and creating new compounded features.

Adjustments have been made to ensure efficiency and potentially extract more informative patterns related to defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:36:27,161 - INFO - llm output = To improve upon both given feature sets, we can blend operations used in both examples and introduce additional transformations that may capture complex relationships in the data. Here is a feature set combining insights from both examples:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Operations**: I have preserved all original features and applied basic transformations such as `sqrt`, `square`, `log`, and `sigmoid`, which are commonly used to explore non-linear relationships.
- **Advanced Scaling and Transformations**: Introduced `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` on features to normalize and standardize data, which can often boost model performance by reducing feature magnitude differences.
- **Combination and Interaction Terms**: Created interaction terms such as `f19 f1 sqrt / f20 f2 tanh *`, which merge different transformations to capture potentially complex dependencies between features. This is a common practice in feature engineering during model building.
- **Performance-Driven Additions**: Based on the instructions that the latter examples tend to be better, I emphasized advanced feature combinations to capture higher-dimensional data relationships.

This comprehensive approach to feature engineering can improve the model's understanding and predictive capability related to software defect occurrences.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The second feature set already appears more advanced, with combinations and interactions added to the basic features. I'll build on this by introducing additional interactions and transformations.

Here is a new feature set that builds upon the previous examples:

```

In this new feature set, I've maintained and expanded upon the interactions and transformations in the prior examples, adding a few new nonlinear interactions and applying various transformations (e.g., `tanh`, `log`) to capture potential nonlinear relationships. These changes aim to further enhance the predictive power of the feature set for the software defect prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:36:51,415 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set, we can combine and transform the existing features using various operations to create potentially more meaningful or discriminant features for the software defect prediction task. Based on the given examples, the latter feature set already improves upon the former using elementary combinations and transformations. Following suit, let's attempt to further enhance this transformation:

1. **Feature Interactions**: Create interactions that may capture subtler effects:
   - `f5 f9 /`: This can show a normalized effort per line of code.
   - `f4 f6 cube +`: Cubed difficulty plus unique operands could capture both complexity and volume of logic.
   - `f0 f7 square *`: Interaction of line count and difficulty, squared to emphasize larger values.

2. **Advanced Transformations**:
   - `f18 tanh`: Tanh applied to the squared intelligence might help distinguish small values while saturating large ones.
   - `f17 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling could normalize the feature to have mean 0 and variance 1, which often helps in model convergence.
   - `f12 cos`: Applying cosine could potentially capture cyclical trends related to lines of code and blank spaces.

3. **Aggregations**:
   - `f9 f16 sum`: Aggregate effort and blank lines to observe effectiveness of code allocation.
   - `f5 f10 mean`: Average of effort and time estimator could offer insights into complexity vs. cost trade-offs.

Overall, ensure transformations enhance in context of defect prediction, focusing on numerical stability via functions like `sigmoid` or `tanh`, and on meaningful interactions among complexity, effort, and volume/length indicators.

Here's a new feature set example merging the ideas:

```
[f5 f9 /, f4 f6 cube +, f0 f7 square *, f18 tanh, f17 stand_scaler, f12 cos, f9 f16 sum, f5 f10 mean, f6 f3 f7 f10 *, f9 f6 sigmoid square *, f8 cube f5 *, f16 f19 cos /]
```

This set introduces further interactions and transformations while focusing on enhancing interpretability and prediction power for the defect task.

2026-01-17 17:37:08,895 - INFO - llm output = Based on the previous examples of feature transformations and the operations applied to generate new features, here's a new and potentially more informative feature set leveraging the given operations and existing features:

- **f0 f3 * f5 cube +**: Multiply f0 and f3, then add the cube of f5. This transformation might capture interactions between these features, along with non-linearity from cubing.
  
- **f1 log f6 cube +**: Take the logarithm of f1 and add it to the cube of f6. Logarithms can stabilize variance and reduce skewness, while cubing introduces non-linearity.

- **f2 f8 / f19 sigmoid +**: Divide f2 by f8 and add the sigmoid of f19. Division helps create proportions or rates, and the sigmoid function can help smooth and confine feature values.

- **f4 f9 minmax_scaler + f12 cube +**: Apply min-max scaling to f9 and add it to f4 and the cube of f12. Min-max scaling brings values within a standard range, helping to normalize features, while cubing adds a non-linear element.

- **f11 sqrt f13 f14 + +**: Calculate the square root of f11 and add the sum of f13 and f14. The square root transformation can reduce skewness, and the addition of other features captures more complexity.

This set of transformations aims to enhance predictive modeling through diverse operations designed to capture complex, non-linear relationships while normalizing or stabilizing certain feature distributions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Explanation of Additions:**

1. **f2 f5 * log**: Combination of features with a logarithmic transformation to capture multiplicative interactions and reduce skewness.
   
2. **f7 f10 * tanh**: Use of hyperbolic tangent to model saturated relationships between combined features.

3. **f8 f14 / reciprocal**: Division followed by a reciprocal transformation to capture inverse relationships.

4. **f3 f4 sqrt +**: Sum of square roots to stabilize variance and handle skewness.

5. **f6 f18 minmax_scaler**: Scaling to normalize values between 0 and 1.

6. **f1 f19 quan_trans +**: Quantile transformation to handle outliers, followed by addition to capture interactions.

7. **f16 f17 f15 * square**: Multiplicative interaction followed by squaring to model quadratic relationships.

Each transformation is designed to model different potential relationships and interactions in the data, which could help improve the prediction of software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:37:30,263 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, we want to construct a new feature set that incorporates complex transformations and combinations that can potentially lead to better predictive performance. The second feature set involves more non-linear transformations and interactions, so we will use it as a starting point and aim to enhance it further.

Here's a proposed improved feature set:

```
[f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f11, f16, f17, f18, f19,

```

Explanation:
- We've kept useful transformations from the second feature set, such as squares and sigmoids of various features.
- We've added some new interactions and transformations like `f2 f3 + sqrt` and `f0 f5 * reciprocal` to explore the impact of combining features in different ways.
- We've also applied `log` and `tanh` functions to explore different non-linear and compressive transformations, such as `f18 log f19 log +` and `f6 tanh f8 tanh +`.
- The newly introduced terms allow for exploration of combined non-linear interactions of the features, which can help in capturing complex patterns in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

I'll design a new feature set that considers interactions, transformations, and possible non-linear relationships between features. 

Here's a better feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f5 f9 *, f4 f7 +, f1 f3 /, f6 f0 *, f1 f1 square, f8 f9 cube, f10 f13 + f14 -, f15 f16 / f17 *, f5 f18 tanh, f8 sqrt, f2 f12 reciprocal, f3 log f6 *, f9 f5 minmax_scaler, f7 f20 sqrt, f19 f11 sin, f17 quant_trans]
```

This feature set includes interactions and non-linear transformations such as `square`, `cube`, `tanh`, `log`, `sqrt`, and the application of scaling methods like `minmax_scaler` and `quant_trans` which can handle skewness and distribution issues, along with basic arithmetic operations. This combination aims to capture complex relationships that could aid in improving prediction performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

```

### Explanation

1. **Nonlinear Emphasis**: Cubing and square root operations allow us to capture nonlinear interactions, making the model potentially more powerful in capturing complex patterns.

2. **Aggregated and Combined Features**: Combining multiple features into a single expression (e.g., summing cubes and square roots) aims to capture latent information from multiple dimensions.

3. **Deep Feature Interactions**: By combining transformations at multiple levels, I've aimed to exploit interactions that simple linear combinations might miss.

This feature set is designed to potentially enhance prediction power through richer representation while incorporating underlying patterns from the original and transformed features.

2026-01-17 17:37:49,198 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions further, let's propose a new feature set by considering transformations that capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. 

Here's a proposed feature set:

```
[f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f11, f16, f17, f18, f19, f1 sigmoid, f4 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f7 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f14 sigmoid, f16 sigmoid, f17 sigmoid, f18 sigmoid, f19 sigmoid, f6 square, f7 square, f8 square, f10 square, f12 square, f16 square, f17 square, f19 square, f6 sigmoid square, f7 sigmoid square, f8 sigmoid square, f10 sigmoid square, f12 sigmoid square, f16 sigmoid square, f17 sigmoid square, f18 sigmoid square, f19 sigmoid square, f11 sigmoid, f11 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f1 sqrt f13 sqrt +, f10 f11 sigmoid +, f7 f8 sigmoid *, f16 f17 square +, f0 f19 tanh, f5 f7 sqrt, f3 log f4 cube +, f9 f12 reciprocal, f2 f20 tanh]
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Transformation Combinations**: I've added some interactions that use transformations on top of existing combinations. For example, `f0 f19 tanh` captures interactions between base features transformed non-linearly.

2. **Additional Transformations**: 
   - Utilize `sqrt` and `cube` on more originals and transformed features to explore useful higher-order interactions.
   - Use `reciprocal` on `f9` and `f12` to capture potential inverse relationships which may be indicative of defects.

3. **New Non-linear Combinations**: 
   - Added `f2 f20 tanh` to capture potentially insightful interactions that might be non-linear and complex in nature.

The proposed feature set aims to capture more intricate patterns and relationships within the data which may improve the model's ability to distinguish between defective and non-defective modules.

The first set applies a variety of mathematical operations, both simple and complex, while the second heavily utilizes combinations of mathematical transformations on a single feature `f9`, along with a mix of basic operations.

Given this context, a more optimized feature set would combine the comprehensive transformations from both examples on diverse features while focusing on retaining potentially informative transformations. Here is a proposed better feature set:

This feature set focuses on:
- Utilizing diverse operations like `sigmoid`, `square`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and feature combinations (`*`) for polynomial features that might capture non-linear interactions.
- Placing importance on `f9` transformations given its previous frequent utilization, potentially indicating its predictive importance.
- Combining mathematical operations with potentially informative interactions among the dataset's metrics.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 f9 *, f4 f6 +, f1 f3 /, f7 f0 *, f10 cube, f11 sqrt, f13 f14 + f15 *, f16 log, f17 reciprocal, f18 square, f19 sigmoid, f9 minmax_scaler]

2026-01-17 17:38:03,291 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, the goal is to create a new feature set that improves upon them by incorporating more insightful transformations while maintaining format consistency. Here's a new feature set:

1. Retain original features: [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20]
2. Combine features using meaningful transformations:
   - Feature interaction and scaling: [f5 f9 *], [f5 tanh], [f9 minmax_scaler], [f1 f2 +]
   - Complex interactions to capture non-linear relationships: 
     - [f10 sqrt f5 tanh f9 * +]
     - [f18 f19 + f20 * f12 *]
   - Logarithmic transformations for handling skewed distributions:
     - [f11 log], [f16 log]
   - Statistical transformation and normalization:
     - [f4 f6 - sqrt], 
     - [f8 f10 / minmax_scaler]
   - Reciprocal to handle large ranges:
     - [f16 reciprocal]
   - Sigmoid for probability-like transformations:
     - [f19 sigmoid f1 f3 / +],
   - Polynomial and arithmetic transformations for extended non-linear patterns:
     - [f6 f14 + square], 
     - [f13 f15 * f0 square +]
   
This new feature set attempts to incorporate multiple operations to enhance potential predictive power while carefully choosing transformations suited to the nature of software metrics to capture more complex patterns and relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:38:15,546 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the provided examples, we can focus on reducing redundancy, and exploring non-linear transformations that may better capture the relationships within the data. Here's an updated feature set combining insights from both examples:

```
[f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f16, f17, f18, f19, f0 f1 +, f2 f3 +, f5 f11 +, f4 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f7 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f16 sigmoid, f17 sigmoid, f18 sigmoid, f19 sigmoid, f1 f2 + sqrt, f6 square, f7 square, f8 square, f10 square, f16 square, f11 f9 sqrt, f5 f9 sqrt, f6 sigmoid square, f7 sigmoid square, f8 sigmoid square, f10 sigmoid square, f12 sigmoid square, f16 sigmoid square, f17 sigmoid square, f18 sigmoid square, f19 sigmoid square, f6 f9 *, f11 f9 * sqrt, f2 f3 + minmax_scaler]
```

Key considerations in this solution:
- Retained certain features with individual transformations such as `sigmoid` and `square` which may capture non-linear relationships effectively.
- Used operations such as `+`, `*`, `sqrt` to generate interaction features that may add more value than isolated features.
- Focused on necessary and meaningful transformations instead of redundant ones to keep the feature space concise while potentially improving predictive power.
