Let's build a new feature set by combining insights from the two examples you provided:

1. Utilize feature scaling and transformation operations to enhance feature interactions.
2. Focus on leveraging quantile transformation for non-linear transformations and scaling operations (stand_scaler) for feature normalization.
3. Explore feature addition and non-linear transformations such as sin, cube, and subtraction to create diverse feature interactions.

Here is the new feature set:

```

Explanation of the new feature set:
1. `f1 f3 +`: Sum of features 1 and 3.
2. `f2 f4 +`: Sum of features 2 and 4.
3. `f3 f3 *`: Square of feature 3 (highlighted by using multiplication, similar to the first example's square manipulation).
4. `f4 stand_scaler`: Standardization of feature 4 for normalization.
5. `f0 f4 + stand_scaler -`: The combination of features 0 and 4 normalized, then subtracted from some reference.
6. `f4 f1 sin +`: Trigonometric transformation on feature 1 added to feature 4 for potential pattern capturing.
7. `f3 f4 + tanh`: Hyperbolic tangent transformation on the sum of features 3 and 4.
8. `f3 f4 + tanh f0 +`: Addition of feature 0 to the hyperbolic tangent transformation for more interaction.
9. `f0 f4 + quan_trans`: Quantile transformation of the sum of features 0 and 4 to capture non-linear effects.
10. `f0 f4 + quan_trans f1 *`: Multiplying the quantile transformation by feature 1 for interaction strength.
11. `f2 cube f3 sin +`: Combining cubic transformation of feature 2 and sin transformation of feature 3.
12. `f4 f3 + quan_trans`: Quantile transformation of the sum of features 4 and 3 for a non-linear effect.

This feature set aims to build on the strengths of the examples provided, while introducing some additional depth through non-linear transformations and standardized interactions.

2026-01-19 20:31:31,131 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the given examples, let's analyze the transformations in each set. The second set includes a variety of transformations using trigonometric functions, logarithms, and hyperbolic tangent, which are often used to capture nonlinear relationships and scale features.

Now, let's generate a new, potentially better feature set that builds on the second example by integrating and expanding on these transformations, while ensuring a focus on potential relevance for the classification task:

1. Start with a combination of basic trigonometric transformations to capture periodic trends in the categorical data:
   - [f0 cos]
   - [f1 cos]
   - [f2 cos]
   - [f3 cos]

2. Consider logarithmic and scaling transformations to handle skewness and variance:
   - [f2 cos log]
   - [f3 cos log]

3. Incorporate polynomial and hyperbolic transformations for capturing more complex interactions:
   - [f1 square]
   - [f0 square tanh]

4. Apply some scaling transformations that can help with feature standardization, assuming the original features are numerical:
   - [f4 stand_scaler] 
   - [f4 minmax_scaler]

5. Explore more complex feature interactions by combining existing transformations with new ones:
   - [f0 cos f1 cos +]
   - [f2 cos f3 cos + log]
   - [f4 sqrt f3 log * tanh] 
   - [f1 square f4 minmax_scaler + cos] 
   - [f3 f2 * cos log]

Thus, the new feature set is:

```
[f0 cos ,f1 cos ,f2 cos ,f3 cos ,f2 cos log ,f3 cos log ,f1 square ,f0 square tanh ,f4 stand_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f0 cos f1 cos + ,f2 cos f3 cos + log ,f4 sqrt f3 log * tanh ,f1 square f4 minmax_scaler + cos ,f3 f2 * cos log]

2026-01-19 20:31:43,047 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided transformations and the goal of improving the feature set, I'll create a new feature set using elements from both examples while trying to enhance feature diversity and likely utility for the prediction task.

Here's the newly proposed feature set:

1. `f4 minmax_scaler` - This transformation standardizes `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` into a [0,1] range using the provided data range, which could be useful for many ML algorithms.

2. `f4 f4 cos tanh - cube` - This combines several transformations: it first applies cosine and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) functions, subtracts the result from the original feature, and then cubes the result. These non-linear transformations could capture complex patterns in the data.

3. `f0 cos f1 cos +` - This sums the cosine transformations of `fathers_occupation` and `sons_occupation`, potentially capturing interactions between these categorical features.

4. `f2 cos log` - Applies the log of the cosine of `family_structure`, introducing non-linear transformation on a categorical feature mapping.

5. `f3 cos log` - Similar to the above but for `race`, adding another non-linear dimension.

6. `f1 square f4 minmax_scaler + cos` - Squares `sons_occupation`, adds the min-max scaled `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`, then applies cosine. This interaction could highlight existing relationships between occupation hierarchy and occupation count.

7. `f4 sqrt` - Applies the square root to `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`, which can help stabilize variance and normalize the distribution.

With these transformations, the goal is to capture both linear and complex interactions, potentially improving the model's ability to predict the binary target effectively.

The strategy involves using transformation functions that help in non-linear mapping (like `tanh`, `cos`, and `sqrt`) and also in maintaining interpretability and different functional relationships (like subtraction and addition of features).

Here's the new and improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 sqrt, f1 cube, f2 tanh, f3 cos, f4 tanh, f0 f1 +, f2 f3 -, f0 f2 * f4 -, f1 f3 f4 * tanh, f2 tanh f4 cube cos, f1 f2 * f3 /, f0 f4 + cube]
```

This feature set combines basic transformations (like `tanh`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `cube`), and basic arithmetic operations to create more complex features while maintaining a balance between linearly and non-linearly transformed features.

```

Explanation:

1. **f0 cos & f1 cos**: Computed the cosine transformation of father's and son's occupations to capture cyclical patterns or relationships.

2. **f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f4 tanh**: Used hyperbolic tangent, a non-linear transformation, to stabilize values and enhance differences in 'family_structure', 'race', and 'counts_for_sons_first_occupation'.

3. **f0 quan_trans log & f1 quan_trans log**: Applied quantile transformation followed by logarithm to convert features to a Gaussian-like distribution and reduce skewness, which can be beneficial for certain machine learning algorithms.

4. **f3 or f4 minmax_scaler * cos**: Combined min-max scaling with cosine on either 'race' or 'counts_for_sons_first_occupation'. This scales the data and captures cyclical patterns that might affect occupation outcomes.

5. **f2 square f4 sqrt + log**: A combination of squaring and square root transformation to enhance differences, with a subsequent logarithmic adjustment to control data skewness.

6. **f1 square sin**: Using square and sine transformations can help capture complex interactions in the son's occupation.

7. **f3 minmax_scaler sqrt f2 +**: Integrated 'race' and 'family_structure' through min-max scaling and square root transformation to capture unique patterns or outliers.

These transformations are designed to emphasize non-linear relationships and stabilize the variance of features, potentially boosting prediction accuracy.

```

Explanation:
- I included the `minmax_scaler` transformation for features `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`, which helps normalize the data and can be beneficial for models sensitive to scales.
- I used the `tanh` transformation for `f0`, `f1`, and `f2`, introducing non-linearities that might capture more complex patterns.
- The `log` transformation is applied to `f4`, which can help manage skewness in the data.
- Features `f0` and `f3` are transformed using `sqrt`, which can help with reducing skewness and stabilizing variance. I combined it with `square` for `f3` to attempt capturing further complex relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
1. I've included the original features and applied some common transformations like `tanh` and `sqrt` to capture non-linear relationships and scale the data.
2. Interaction terms like `f0 f4 *`, `f1 f3 *`, and `f4 f3 f1 + *` capture the combined effects of different features, which might be useful for predictions.
3. The combination `f2 f2 sqrt` introduces a non-linear transformation to `f2`, and `f1 f2 f3 / +` is a complex interaction with division and addition to induce more variability in the feature set.

The two examples suggest experimenting with feature transformations such as trigonometric functions (cosine), logarithmic transformations, and cube operations. In order to provide a new feature set that attempts to capture informative variations in the data, I'll combine some of these ideas:

Here is a new feature set leveraging transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 log, f1 log, f2 log, f3 log, f1 square, f4 square, f0 cos sin, f1 cube log]
```

Explanation:
- Utilize the `log` transformation on `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to help normalize potential skewness in non-negative features.
- Apply a `square` transformation to `f1` and `f4` to emphasize larger variations.
- Combine `cos` and `sin` operations on `f0` for capturing potential cyclic patterns.
- Use a combination of `cube` and `log` transformations on `f1` to capture non-linearity and reduce skewness. 

This set aims to improve upon the examples provided by including a diverse set of mathematical transformations, potentially better capturing underlying patterns.

1. **Quantile Transformation**: Applied to `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to normalize their distributions.
2. **Log Transformation**: Applied to `f2` to reduce skewness.
3. **Min-Max Scaling and Cosine Transformation**: Applied to `f4` for both normalization and nonlinear transformation which might capture periodic patterns.
4. **Square Root** of the Product of `f0` and `f1`: This captures a multiplicative interaction and scales it back with a square root.
5. **Log Transformation of the Division of `f3` and `f4`**: Useful for ratio-based insights while maintaining stability.
6. **Tanh of Sum of `f1` and `f2`**: Adds nonlinearity while ensuring output is bound between -1 and 1.
7. **Product of `f0` and `f4`, followed by Min-Max Scaling**: Reinforces the interaction while normalizing.
8. **Division of `f3` and `f0`, followed by Sin Transformation**: Adds periodic nonlinear transformation to a ratio for richer feature extraction.

Each transformation and combination is aimed at extracting more nuanced relationships and interactions, which can be helpful in improving model predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Farm_Laborer, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsman-Construction, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Proprietor, Service_Worker, Operative-Manufacturing, Manager, Professional_Self-Employed, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Clerk, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional-Salaried, Craftsman-Construction, Farm_Laborer, Salesman-Retail]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.5, Mean = 17.2574, Std = 46.5042

Data Examples:
fathers_occupation is Craftsman-Manufacturing. sons_occupation is Operative-Manufacturing. family_structure is intact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 236.9.
Answer: 0
fathers_occupation is Craftsman-Construction. sons_occupation is Salesman-Retail. family_structure is intact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 47.0.
Answer: 0
fathers_occupation is Craftsmen-Other. sons_occupation is Salesman-Retail. family_structure is intact. race is black. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 1.0.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 log, f1 log, f2 log, f3 log, f1 square, f4 square, f0 cos sin, f1 cube log] 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f1 square tanh, f0 quan_trans log, f2 square, f4 minmax_scaler cos, f3 minmax_scaler cos, f4 sqrt tanh, f1 square f4 minmax_scaler + tanh, f3 f2 * cos log]

2026-01-19 20:34:40,386 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature sets given in your examples, I'll generate a new feature set that incorporates and extends some of the transformations applied. This new feature set will focus on applying a variety of transformations to potentially capture different aspects of the data distribution and interactions between features, thus enhancing the predictive power for the task.

Here is a newly engineered feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, 
f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, 
f1 square tanh, 
f0 quan_trans log, f2 square, 
f4 minmax_scaler cos, 
f3 minmax_scaler cos, 
f4 sqrt tanh, 
f1 square f4 minmax_scaler + tanh, 
f3 f2 * cos log, 
f0 rec square + f1 f4 * / log, 
f3 quantile_transform sigmoid, 
f4 stand_scaler tanh, 
f0 f1 + log, 
f2 f4 cube * minmax_scaler, 
f3 sqrt sqrt minmax_scaler]
```

In this set, I've utilized various transformations like quantile transformation, standard scaling, min-max scaling, and mathematical operations to help capture non-linear relationships and potential interactions among features.
