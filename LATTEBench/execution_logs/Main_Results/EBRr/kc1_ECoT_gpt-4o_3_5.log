you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Enhancements and strategy:
1. **Combined Transformations**: Used both `stand_scaler` and `sigmoid` transformations across the diverse set of features for enhanced normalization and non-linear scaling.
2. **Feature Interactions**: Introduced more combinations, e.g., summing and multiplying relevant pairs to capture interactions.
3. **Additional Transformations**: Applied transformations like `log` and `reciprocal` to capture exponential and inverse relationships.
4. **Diverse Selection**: Retained the top features and transformations from both sets while expanding normalization and scaling operations for broader prep-processing.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:

- **Retained Features**: Most of the original features (f0 through f20) are retained to maintain the initial information set.

- **Mathematical Transformations**:
  - Use of **reciprocal** transformation: Provides insight into inverse relations, potentially transforming skewed distributions into more Gaussian-like ones.
  - Use of **square** and **sigmoid** transformations: Helpful in reducing the effect of outliers and bringing non-linearity.
  - Use of **square** on f5: Enhances the effect size for that feature, particularly if it relates to variance.
  
- **Combinations of Transformations**: 
  - **f0, f1, and f3** have multiple layers of reciprocal transformations, implying deeper inverse relationships.
  - **f9 f4 +**: Indicates a combined feature that could reveal interaction effects not captured by single features.
  
- **Use of Min-max and sigmoid scaling**: Offers normalization benefits, promoting pure linear relationships for some models and enhancing stability in optimization.
  
- **Advanced Transformations**: 
  - The transformation involving **reciprocal, square, and sqrt** helps normalize or emphasize specific data characteristics.
  
- **Compositional combinations**: Combining features like **f10 minmax_scaler + f11** could expose relational interactions.

This feature set aims to encapsulate diverse feature transformations while exploring interactions, potentially improving prediction models by capturing non-linear relationships and normalizing data distributions.

```

Here's an explanation of the transformations and combinations:

- Min-max scaling is applied to all features to ensure comparable ranges.
- Non-linear transformations like `sqrt`, `square`, `tanh`, and `log` are applied to select features to capture potential non-linear relationships.
- Interaction features (e.g., `f4 f11 -`, `f5 f6 *`) are created to capture relationships between different features, potentially improving the model's ability to learn complex patterns.
- Aggregation of features using addition (e.g., `f9 f10 +`, `f12 f13 + f14 +`) can help consolidate information and reduce dimensionality.
- The `reciprocal` function is applied to select features to create more diverse non-linear interactions. 
- Advanced transformations like `sigmoid` are applied to leverage non-linear boundaries.
- Cubing `f1` adds variability and non-linearity.

These transformations aim to capture more complex interactions between features while maintaining consistent feature scaling across the dataset.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:51:33,040 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two new feature set examples provided, I'll suggest a better feature set by considering a balance of complex transformations and basic operations to potentially capture various nonlinear relationships within the data. I'll ensure to incorporate transformations that may enhance predictive performance while not overly complicating the feature set unnecessarily.

Here is the improved feature set:

```

```

In this improved feature set, I've included a mixture of basic mathematical transformations such as square, square root, log, and reciprocal, along with statistical transformations like standard scaling and min-max scaling. These operations combined with non-linear transformations like sigmoid, sine, cosine, and tanh can potentially capture more intricate patterns in the data. Additionally, I've retained some combinations and arithmetic operations on these features to reflect interactions and relationships among different metrics.

Here is a new, potentially improved feature set:

In this version, more use has been made of transformation functions like `tanh`, `sin`, and `sqrt`, while retaining valuable combinations from both previous examples such as multiplications and summed interactions. This proposal aims to provide a balance between complexity and a diversity of features for potential improved prediction capability.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Log Transformation**: Useful for data exhibiting exponential growth or to stabilize variance. It has been applied on the original features and their combinations to potentially improve linear relationships with the target.

2. **Square Root Transformation**: Helps in reducing skewness, particularly useful for moderately right-skewed distributions. Applied to selected features (`f0`, `f5`, `f11`) to see if they capture more of the variation in the target.

3. **Quantile Transformation and Min-Max Scaling**: These methods are kept from the previous suggestion to continue leveraging cumulative distribution effects and linear scaling, respectively. The Quantile Transformer is particularly useful for making features follow a normal distribution, thus potentially enhancing model performance with algorithms that assume normality.

4. **Feature Differences**: Differences between features (`f4` and `f11`) are retained and transformed to capture their interactions more effectively.

These transformed features aim to improve the predictive power of models trained on the KC1 Software defect prediction task. The transformations are designed to introduce non-linearity, reduce skewness, and maintain scale compatibility among features, which can enhance learning in machine learning models.

I have maintained a balance between operations like scaling (`stand_scaler`), trig functions (`cos`, `tanh`), and basic arithmetic. These transformations are likely to enhance feature representation in the context of defect prediction while preventing redundancy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:52:03,118 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two provided feature sets, we can combine insights from both. The first set explores transformations like standard scaling, quantile transformation, and combinations of multiple features with arithmetic operations, while the second set heavily utilizes the sigmoid transformation, square transformation, and combinations with a focus on multiple dependencies on `f11`.

Here's a new feature set that builds upon both examples:

``` 
[f0 ,f4 ,f6 ,f8 ,f11 ,f17 ,f8 stand_scaler ,f11 square ,f9 cube ,f11 sigmoid ,f6 f0 + ,f11 f0 + sigmoid ,f11 f6 + sigmoid ,f11 f8 + sigmoid ,f11 f17 + sigmoid ,f4 f6 stand_scaler + ,f4 f8 stand_scaler + ,f6 f8 stand_scaler + ,f10 f0 sigmoid + ,f11 f0 + f6 + ,f11 f4 + f8 + ,f11 f4 + f6 + f0 + ,f11 f0 sigmoid + f6 + ,f4 f13 stand_scaler + f0 cos + ,f11 f11 square + sigmoid ,f11 f2 sigmoid + f6 + ,f11 f13 sigmoid + f14 + ,f11 f15 sigmoid + f18 + ,f11 sqrt ,f8 stand_scaler f9 cube + ,f12 minmax_scaler f12 + stand_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Key Feature Inclusion:** Both sets include features like `f0`, `f4`, `f6`, `f8`, `f11`, and `f17`. These are likely crucial for prediction, so they are preserved.

2. **Transformations and Combinations:** 
   - The use of `stand_scaler`, `sigmoid`, and `square` transformations is carried over, as these can help to normalize and spotlight variability.
   - `cube` transformation on `f9` captures potential non-linear nature.
   - Combinations of multiple features (especially addition after certain transformations) help to capture interactions.

3. **Complex Feature Combinations:** 
   - Features like `f4 f13 stand_scaler + f0 cos +` maintain the use of both standard scaling and trigonometric transformations, which can be effective at capturing non-linear interactions.
   - Use of nested operations like `f11 f0 + f6 +` and `f11 f4 + f6 + f0 +` leverage potential interactions effectively.

4. **Redundancy Removal**: 
   - Simplified by removing potentially less impactful operations to keep the feature set focused and prevent overfitting.

Overall, this new feature set attempts to balance complexity with interpretability by keeping effective, commonly used transformations in predictive models.

2026-01-17 17:52:09,584 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the provided examples, we will utilize a combination of transformations. This new set will integrate various transformations that help capture non-linear relationships and handle skewness, while also assembling new interactions that may enhance predictive power.

Here's a new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

```

The ideas behind this new set include:
1. **Standard Scaling**: Retained for all features to improve model convergence and interpretability.
2. **Feature Interactions**: Added interaction terms like `f1 f2 +`, `f4 f10 *`, which can capture higher-order dependencies between features.
3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Incorporated transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, `sigmoid`, and `cube` to handle skewness and capture complex relationships.
4. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Used to manage features with potentially high range variations.

This set aims to preserve a balance between complex feature interactions and simple transformations to enhance predictive capability while retaining the interpretability of the model.

### Explanation of Selected Transformations:

1. **Square Root and Logarithmic Transformations:** 
   - Applied primarily to reduce skewness in continuous features. This can be particularly useful for features with large ranges or distributions that are right-skewed.
   
2. **Min-Max Scaling:** 
   - This normalizes the data to a range between 0 and 1, useful for ensuring equal weighting in further transformations and model applications.
   
3. **Basic Arithmetic (Addition, Multiplication):** 
   - New interaction features are generated by combining different pairs of features, allowing models to potentially capture interactions between different aspects of the software metrics.
   
4. **Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh):**
   - This non-linear transformation can help normalize the data, bringing extreme values closer to the mean.
   
5. **Reciprocal Transformation:** 
   - Useful for transforming right-skewed data, especially where zero-centered skewness might hinder model performance.
   
6. **Logarithm Transformation:**
   - Employed for features with exponential growth, making them more linear and easier to model.

By using these transformations, the new feature set has the potential to improve prediction accuracy by providing the predictive model with a more informative set of inputs that capture diverse characteristics of the original data matrix through non-linear operations, scaling, and functional transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:52:26,585 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature transformation examples provided, we want to utilize a combination of transformations to create new features that might capture better patterns from the original feature set. The transformations should increase the discriminative power for the downstream task of defect prediction. Here’s a combined and improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 quan_trans ,f2 sqrt ,f3 log ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f6 cube ,f11 stand_scaler ,f13 tanh ,f15 sigmoid ,f17 square ,f8 / f9 ,f19 * f1]
```

### Explanation:
1. **`f9 quan_trans`**: Maintain the quantile transformation on `f9`, which might help with stabilizing the distribution of this feature.

2. **`f2 sqrt`**: Square root transformation on `f2`, which can mitigate the effects of skewness.

3. **`f3 log`**: Applying logarithm to `f3`, another method to handle skewed data, especially useful if data follows a power law.

4. **`f4 minmax_scaler`**: Scaling `f4` between 0 and 1 for normalization, useful for features with large ranges.

5. **`f6 cube`**: Cubing `f6` to amplify any potential polynomial relationships.

6. **`f11 stand_scaler`**: Standardization of `f11` by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

7. **`f13 tanh`**: Hyperbolic tangent applied to `f13` to compress values in a bounded range (-1, 1), helping with outlier effects.

8. **`f15 sigmoid`**: Sigmoid function applied to `f15`, another way to scale values into a (0, 1) range.

9. **`f17 square`**: Squaring `f17` to potentially enhance contrast for small differences in values.

10. **`f8 / f9`**: Combining two features through division, which might reveal relative differences or dependencies.

11. **`f19 * f1`**: Interaction term by multiplying two features, allowing the model to consider combined effects.

By selecting and combining these different transformations, the new feature set is enhanced for potential non-linear relationships and tailored scaling, which might significantly improve prediction strength for the software defect task.

In this set:
- I've retained some original and reciprocal transformations as they can help address skewness.
- The stand_scaler, tanh transformations, and their combinations are useful for scaling and introducing non-linearity.
- I included square roots and logarithm transformations for stabilizing variance and addressing skewness.
- Added interaction terms (product terms) between some features suggesting possible interactions that enhance predictive power.
- A combination of operations to cover a broader range of transformations while avoiding excessive complexity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation of Feature Set:

1. **Basic Features**: Start with the original features as they carry fundamental information.

2. **Basic Transformations**: Include simple mathematical transformations (e.g., division, multiplication) to capture relationships between features.

3. **Advanced Transformations**:
   - **Reciprocal, Cosine, and Log**: As seen in feature sets, these help in non-linear scaling and compression of values.
   - **Tanh, Sigmoid**: Non-linear transformations that capture subtle variances in features.
   - **Square Root, Cube**: To handle skewness and different distribution ranges.

4. **Standardization and Scaling**:
   - **Min-Max Scaling, Standard Scaling**: Normalize data for better convergence and interpretation.
   - **Quantile Transformation**: Normalize feature space uniformly, useful for handling outliers.

By integrating these transformations, the feature set aims to capture both linear and non-linear relationships, normalized scales, and reduce skewness, thus improving predictive quality in diverse models.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:

1. *Standardization:* Using `stand_scaler` on features standardizes them to have zero mean and unit variance, making them more comparable.
2. *Logarithmic Transformation:* `log` is useful for compressing the range of features skewed positively.
3. *Non-linear Transformations:* `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `cos`, and `sqrt` introduce non-linear transformations, which can help in capturing relationships that are not linear.
4. *Combinations and Interactions:*
   - `f1 f2 +` and similar expressions explore interactions between features.
   - `f2 f7 /` examines relationships by dividing two features, helpful for ratio-sensitive tasks.
5. *Reciprocal Transformation:* `reciprocal` is particularly effective for skewed distributions.
6. *New Interactions*: Added combinations like `f10 f18 +`, `f0 f3 -`, and `f4 f12 *` to explore more feature interactions which can uncover useful patterns.
7. *Feature Selection:* Removed redundant transformations and focused on potentially valuable interactions based on domain expertise and data distributions.

The updated feature set aims to uncover latent patterns using mathematical operations which might support a better prediction of software defects. Remember the goal is not just to create more features, but to create features that capture the complexity of the data more effectively.

Enhancements:
1. **Minmax Scaler on `f0`**: Adds normalization to the `loc`-related feature to help in understanding its distribution and importance.
2. **Advanced Interaction Terms**: Combined multiple features to form interaction terms. For example, `(f0 f1 f4 + * sqrt)` to capture complex relationships.
3. **Tanh on product terms**: Provides non-linearity to capture saturation effects between features (`f19 f20 * tanh`).
4. **Log Transformation**: Helps stabilize variance and manage skewness in data (`f8 log`).
5. **Additional Basic Operations**: Added operations like division (`f3 f5 /`) and subtraction (`f0 f2 -`) for more granular feature relationships.
6. **Trigonometric Addition**: Introduced `sin` operation to introduce periodicity effects (`f11 f8 sin +`).

These transformations aim to enhance model learning by creating features that capture diverse aspects of the software defect data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
- Derived features using simple transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, `square`, and `tanh` might capture important non-linearities.
- Operations between different features such as `*`, `+`, and `/` can reveal synergies or compensations between different aspects of the code metrics.
- Use of `reciprocal`, `cos`, `minmax_scaler`, and other transformations on certain features can help in standardizing scales and enhancing interpretability.

```

This set uses a variety of operations, including logs for potential normalization, reciprocal and cube for non-linear transformations, and scaling (min-max, standard) for normalization. It also combines various features using operations like addition and multiplication to explore interactions. This is intended to offer more flexibility in capturing complex patterns in the data that might be associated with software defects.

2026-01-17 17:53:18,517 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and the operations available, I will create a new feature set that improves predictive performance by incorporating relevant transformations and interactions:

- I will include basic transformations like `stand_scaler`, `log`, and `sqrt` to handle skews and different scales.
- I will create interaction terms and polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
- I'll also capture some feature importance via domain-specific transformations like ratios of `f9` with other features.

Here is the enhanced feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

```

### Explanation:
- **Feature scaling (e.g., `stand_scaler`)** helps the model converge faster during training and treats each feature equally.
- **Logarithmic and square root transformations** of features like `f9` address skewness in data distribution, which might be essential for linear models or distance-based algorithms.
- **Interactions (e.g., `f11 f9 +`, `f5 f8 *`)** capture relationships between features that linear models otherwise cannot capture. This is helpful when trying to capture complex patterns that could be indicative of code defects.
- **Feature ratios (e.g., `f9 f8 /`, `f9 f7 /`)** are often helpful in domains such as software metrics, providing insights into normalized complexity or volume per line of code.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Statistical Transformations:**
   - I reused sqrt, reciprocal, log and tanh transformations because they can effectively normalize and scale diverse value ranges such as those seen in features like `v` and `e`.

2. **Feature Interactions:**
   - Interaction terms such as `f0 f5 *`, help capture relationships between features like `loc` and `v`, which might be useful in identifying defect-prone modules.
   - New combinations such as `f0 f1 + sqrt`, `f7 f8 * log`, and others were added to explore additional interactions, potentially uncovering useful patterns correlated with software defects.

3. **Advanced Operations:**
   - Adding operations like `reciprocal` and `tanh` further processes original and engineered features for potentially better modeling of non-linear relationships.
   - Features like `f18 f19 + reciprocal tanh` enhance representation variety, allowing models to learn complex patterns.

This new feature set integrates a wide array of transformations and interactions while still being mindful of computational efficiency. This should yield a richer representation of the data, improving the ability of downstream prediction tasks to distinguish between defective and non-defective software modules.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:53:50,898 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given two feature sets and their transformation operations, we aim to propose a better feature set that optimizes data representation for the KC1 Software defect prediction task. The goal is to enhance predictive performance by suitably transforming features.

Here is a combined and improved feature set proposal:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f9 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f11 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f13 stand_scaler ,f14 stand_scaler ,f15 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f17 stand_scaler ,f18 stand_scaler ,f19 stand_scaler ,f20 stand_scaler ,f11 sigmoid ,f9 quan_trans ,f9 sqrt ,f4 log ,f7 tanh]
```

### Explanation of Choices:

1. **Standardization (stand_scaler):** Applied on a broad range of features (`f0` to `f20`). This transformation is beneficial for algorithms that assume normally distributed data or are sensitive to feature scales, like SVM or K-NN.

2. **Sigmoid & Sqrt for `f9`:** Retained for `f9` as it combines non-linear transformations that can capture complex patterns in skewed distributions often seen in numerical features.

3. **Sigmoid for `f11`:** The sigmoid function squashes values into the [0, 1] range, which can be useful for stabilizing mean-variance relationships.

4. **Log Transformation for `f4`:** Chosen to reduce the impact of potentially high variance in the Halstead 'volume', especially useful if this feature is highly skewed.

5. **Tanh for `f7`:** Tanh transformation is useful for centering values between [-1, 1], providing symmetry which may help certain models. It's applied here for `f7` (difficulty), which might benefit from distribution centering.

This feature engineering setup combines standardization for uniform scaling with transformations that address potential skews or variances, potentially improving model fit and accuracy in predicting software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here, I've expanded the feature set by combining original features using various mathematical and scaling transformations to capture non-linear relationships and normalize feature distributions. The operations were chosen to diversify the types of transformations, including logarithmic, square root, sigmoid, cube, and others, which could be useful for complex relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

 f11 sqrt, f9 cube, f9 sigmoid]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Retained Base Features**: Keeping all base features (f0 to f20) ensures we have the original information representation, which is crucial initially.

2. **Composite Features**: 
   - Used combinations like `f6 f2 sqrt +` and `f9 f11 sqrt +` to potentially capture interactions.
   - Added features like `f11 f11 square +` and `f11 f11 cube + minmax_scaler` for emphasizing strong influences of certain metrics (like Halstead's effort).

3. **Statistical and Mathematical Transformations**: 
   - Used scaling (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`), which can be significant for regularized models or distance-based models. 
   - Transformations like `reciprocal`, `sqrt`, and `cube` help normalize or emphasize certain distributions.

4. **Non-linear Transformations**: 
   - Incorporated trigonometric (`cos`) and logistic (`sigmoid`) transformations which can capture non-linear relationships.

By combining these elements, we aim to build feature interactions that are likely to capture complex patterns in the data set, contributing to the efficiency of predicting software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The latter set incorporates only a quantile transformation, so we'll combine elements from both sets and apply additional transformations.

Here is a better feature set:

```

```

Explanation:
1. **Basic Features:** Retain all original features (`f0` to `f20`).
2. **Quantile Transformation:** Apply `quan_trans` from the latter feature set example to `f9`.
3. **Stand Scaler and Tanh Transformation:** Add combined transformations on features similar to the first example.
4. **Subtraction Operation:** Use a simple subtraction (`f8 f9 -`) which was also part of the first example.
5. **Square Root Transformation:** Apply `sqrt` operation to a combination (`f5 f1 +`) as an additional non-linear transformation.
6. **Sin Transformation:** Apply trigonometric transformation (`sin`) to `f5`.
7. **Reciprocal and Log Transformation:** Combine reciprocal and logarithmic transformations to a feature ratio for potential variance reduction (`f9 f0 reciprocal + log`).

The feature engineering should explore transformations like scaling, reciprocal, trigonometric functions, and mathematical operations.

Here is a proposed improved feature set:

```

```

This set combines different types of feature transformations:
- Basic operations to keep original features (f0, f1, ..., f20).
- Logarithmic, reciprocal, cosine, hyperbolic tangent, square root, and cube transformations to capture non-linear relations.
- Scaling methods like standard scaler and min-max scaler to standardize feature ranges.
- Mathematical operations (+, *, /, -) to combine transformations and create new interactions, potentially capturing complex relationships.

This diverse combination aims to explore both linear and non-linear characteristics in the dataset to improve defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This new feature set incorporates the strengths of both examples, applying `sqrt` transformation to improve the distribution of some original features and potentially capturing non-linear relationships, while retaining transformation robustness through `cos`, `tanh`, and standardized scaling. Additionally, `f11 stand_scaler reciprocal tanh` is kept to benefit from observing the standardized and transformed reciprocal effect on the feature.

```

### Explanation:
- **Basic transformations**: Retained the original features to ensure no loss of base information.
- **Feature interactions**: Added interactions between `f5` and other features using the `tanh` function, which is a powerful non-linear transformation.
- **Statistical scaling**: Incorporated `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for features `f12` and `f16` with `f17` to standardize and normalize some features.
- **Combination of new features**: Created interactions using basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `*`, `/`) and non-linear transformations (`tanh`, `cos`, `log`, `sqrt`).
- **Complex transformations**: Involved intricate combinations like `f0 f1 f2 / * f3 + tanh`, which captures interaction and non-linear transformation.

```

Here's the rationale behind the selection and transformation of features:

1. **Original Features Retained**: Retain a subset of original features to preserve fundamental information.
2. **Non-linear transformations**: Include transformations such as `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cos` which can help capture non-linear patterns.
3. **Log and Square Root**: Apply `log` to `f1` and `f18`, and `sqrt` to `f3`, as these can stabilize variance and make distributions closer to Gaussian, improving model performance.
4. **Interactions and Combinations**: Create interaction terms using addition and multiplication to capture relationships between features, e.g., `f0 log f5 tanh +`, `f3 sqrt f18 log *`.
5. **Scaling and Normalization**: Use `stand_scaler` to standardize `f16` and `f11` to make the model less sensitive to outliers.
6. **Advanced Transformations**: Incorporating transformations like `cube` and `reciprocal` can help in capturing complex dependencies.

These choices aim to enrich the feature space by introducing potentially informative features, which can lead to improved predictive performance in software defect prediction tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:54:57,887 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given two new feature set examples, I have created a new feature set that aims to leverage useful transformations for improved predictions. This new set focuses on a combination of transformations that are likely to capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between features.

Here is the new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, 
f0 f1 + sqrt, f3 f4 * reciprocal, f9 log, f5 f11 tanh, f5 reciprocal, f8 f9 reciprocal + sqrt, 
f5 f5 sin, f20 minmax_scaler]
```

Explanation of some key transformations:
- `f0 f1 + sqrt`: Combination of `loc` and `v(g)` to capture the potential interaction between lines of code and cyclomatic complexity, followed by the square root to reduce skewness.
- `f3 f4 * reciprocal`: Interaction of `iv(g)` and `n` to represent the compounded effect of design complexity and total operators+operands, with reciprocal to manage large values.
- `f9 log`: Log of `e` (Halstead effort) to handle a wide range of values and potentially highlight differences in effort related to defects.
- `f5 f11 tanh`: Non-linear transformation of `v` and `t` to capture interactions between volume and time estimator, which can help learn complex relationships.
- `f8 f9 reciprocal + sqrt`: Adding reciprocal and square root to manage features with a wide range of dynamic values, combining `i` and `e`.
- `f5 f5 sin`: Sine transformation of `v` (volume) for periodicity and non-linearity.
- `f20 minmax_scaler`: Scale `branchCount` to the range [0, 1] to manage varying magnitudes.

This feature set provides a diverse range of transformations to capture complex patterns relevant to software defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:55:08,234 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformation examples, the goal is to create new features through various mathematical and scaling operations that are likely to capture interactions or nonlinear associations within the data better, potentially improving predictive accuracy for the software defect prediction task.

Here is a new set of transformed features that combine elements from both examples and attempt to introduce new meaningful transformations:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f5 square, f6 log, f9 log, f2 f3 * sqrt, f5 f6 /, f11 f4 - tanh, f11 f7 f10 tanh +, f8 f9 - reciprocal, f5 f9 cube +, f5 f11 stand_scaler + sigmoid, f0 f1 + f2 * reciprocal, f3 f4 reciprocal +, f5 cos reciprocal sigmoid, f8 f13 log +, f6 f18 reciprocal tanh +, f11 f9 reciprocal sigmoid, f1 f7 + log, f5 f5 cos reciprocal +, f9 f11 + log, f10 f19 * f15 sigmoig, f20 minmax_scaler, f12 log, f14 f16 * f17 sqrt]
```

In this feature set:
- I've included operations like `square`, `log`, `cube`, `cos`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and scaling functions (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) to capture nonlinear relationships and interactions.
- Added interactions and combinations between features (e.g., `f0 f1 + f2 * reciprocal`).
- Utilized functions such as `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, and `log`, which can highlight differences between features or control for skewness.
- Included individual transformations (e.g., `f5 square`, `f6 log`) alongside combinations that integrate two or more transformed features.

This feature set leverages a diverse range of mathematical transformations aimed at enhancing the information available to a predictive model which may contribute to better differentiation between modules likely or unlikely to have defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This set combines some unique transformations with potentially higher discriminative power for downstream tasks and experimental basis from both examples. It attempts to capture non-linear interactions with functions like `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and combinations of features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:55:35,396 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the two examples provided, I'll design a new feature set by integrating transformations from both examples and including additional transformations. The idea is to explore diverse transformations that may capture the data characteristics better, potentially improving downstream task performance.

Here's a proposed new feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20,

f5 f5 cos reciprocal + ,f9 f11 + ,f9 square, f8 sqrt, f13 cube, f10 tanh, f1 sigmoid]
```

Explanation:
- I included `reciprocal` transformations for the first few features (as in the first example) to capture inverse relationships.
- The `cos`, `sigmoid`, `quan_trans`, and `sqrt` transformations, drawn from both examples, can capture periodic, s-shaped, quantile-based, and root-based transformations, respectively.
- Added logarithm, square, and cubic transformations to capture non-linear relationships and interactions.
- Included `minmax_scaler` and `standard_scaler` for normalization purposes, which can help in models sensitive to feature scaling.
- Put in transformations like `tanh` which might help capture additional non-linear patterns.

These diverse transformations can potentially help improve the prediction task by offering different perspectives on feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:55:40,757 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, I will create a new feature set that incorporates elements from both while adding potential improvements for defect prediction. The approach balances diversity in transformations with emphasis on non-linear mappings which are often beneficial for complex tasks like defect prediction. Here is the new feature set:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 cos ,f8 stand_scaler ,f2 sqrt ,f3 reciprocal ,f11 cube ,f4 reciprocal ,f17 f5 cos + ,f11 f0 reciprocal + ,f6 f8 stand_scaler + ,f11 f4 reciprocal + sigmoid ,f9 f11 cube + ,f10 f5 cos + minmax_scaler ,f6 f3 reciprocal * stand_scaler ,f12 f11 sqrt + ,f4 f8 stand_scaler reciprocal + ,f18 f7 sqrt + ,f0 f19 reciprocal + sigmoid ,f20 f5 cos reciprocal sigmoid + ,f11 f11 cube + minmax_scaler]

2026-01-17 17:55:49,298 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set by optimizing and introducing new transformations, let's derive a more advanced feature set based on the given examples. Combining various transformations can potentially capture more nuanced patterns in the data, aiding in enhancing predictive performance. Here is a refined feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 cube, f11 sqrt, f18 f7 sqrt +, f17 f5 cos +, f0 f19 reciprocal + sigmoid, f20 f5 cos reciprocal sigmoid +, f11 f11 square + minmax_scaler, f11 f4 reciprocal +, f4 f8 stand_scaler reciprocal +, f11 f11 cube + minmax_scaler, f10 f5 cos + minmax_scaler, f9 cube sigmoid +, f11 f11 square sigmoid +, f9 f11 sqrt +, f11 f0 reciprocal +, f6 f2 sqrt + stand_scaler, f6 f3 reciprocal * stand_scaler, f11 f4 reciprocal + sigmoid, f11 stand_scaler f5 cos +, f3 reciprocal f11 sqrt +, f9 f11 cube + sigmoid]
```

Key considerations in this feature set:
- Use of advanced transformations like `cube`, `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, and various scalers which can capture non-linear relationships.
- Combination of features with transformations to potentially enhance complex interactions between variables.
- Employing standard and min-max scaling to normalize feature distributions, aiding in better model performance.
- Using a combination of base operations like `+`, `*`, for constructing composite features can help in capturing interactions.
