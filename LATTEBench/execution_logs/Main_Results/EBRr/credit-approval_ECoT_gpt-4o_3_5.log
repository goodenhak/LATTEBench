you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set combines aspects from both examples and emphasizes the use of transformations like sigmoid and sin, which are likely to introduce non-linearity to the model, potentially improving model predictions. It also retains the calculation of `f14 f1 +` as this operation combines income and gender, which might have a significant impact on the outcome.

2026-01-17 16:46:36,085 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, let's create a new feature set by taking inspiration from both examples and ensuring it's improved for predictive modeling. The goal is to have a meaningful transformation of features that may capture underlying patterns better than the previous examples.

Here's a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f14 ,f2 f9 * ,f3 f10 * ,f6 f11 * ,f8 f0 + ,f7 f1 + ,f14 f3 minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f5 log ,f13 reciprocal ,f13 sin ,f13 cos ,f13 tanh ,f14 tanh ,f2 f14 tanh ,f3 f4 tanh ,f6 f7 tanh ,f9 f10 tanh ,f11 f12 sigmoid ,f2 f9 sqrt ,f3 f7 sqrt ,f4 f8 sqrt ,f10 f11 sqrt ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: Retaining some original features in their basic form to keep the foundational information (e.g., `f0, f1, ... f11, f14`).
- **Multiplicative Interactions**: Introducing interactions between some features (`f2 f9 *`, `f3 f10 *`, `f6 f11 *`), which might capture combined effects.
- **Additive Interactions**: Adding some combinations (`f8 f0 +`, `f7 f1 +`), which might capture linear increases in interactions.
- **Non-linear Transformations**: Utilizing non-linear transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tanh`) to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Advanced Scaling and Normalization Techniques**: Including techniques like `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `sigmoid` to assist models in capturing feature distribution without being influenced by scale.

This feature set includes both linear combinations and non-linear transformations, which are essential for capturing complex patterns in the data, ultimately improving the model's predictive capability.

In this set:
- I've retained the concepts of combining the reciprocal of a feature (`f1` in this context) with other features, as this often brings a distinct transformation.
- Cubes and interactions are maintained, e.g., `f14 f8 cube - f14 f2 cube - -`, to address potential non-linear relationships.
- Interactions between transformed features, such as `f8 f14 f2 cube - -`, are included to discover potential interactions influencing credit card approvals.
- The subtraction and combined operations reflect the relationship manipulations to discern more intricate differences which might be useful for prediction. 

This new feature set targets examining broader interactions with complex feature relations, which often significantly benefit classification-related tasks such as credit risk prediction.

Let's aim to blend statistical scaling, non-linear transformations, and interaction terms. Here's a new feature set:

```

In this feature set:
- Added `sqrt` (square root) transformation to enhance the signal for positively skewed distributions.
- Used `tanh` as a non-linear transformation for capturing complex relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Explanation:
- Chose features with historical significance in examples (f1, f2, f5, f8, f10, f13, etc.)
- Used non-linear transformations like `sin`, `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, and `log` to enable complex pattern capture.
- Included interactions such as `f13 f8 *` and `f13 f10 *`.
- Used scaling techniques to normalize certain features (`minmax_scaler`).
- Created combinations of transformations to capture complex relationships.

I have combined the transformations used in the prior sets and introduced additional elements such as combining features with operations like addition or multiplication and introducing new transformations like tanh and sigmoid in combination with sqrt and reciprocal. This more diverse array of feature transformations has the potential to reveal further relationships and enhance the predictive power of models trained on these features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:47:00,597 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, the latter example appears to incorporate deeper transformations utilizing the sigmoid function. This suggests a more complex feature representation, potentially capturing more intricate patterns in the data.

To enhance the feature set further while maintaining a balance between complexity and interpretability, I propose the following feature set:

- Include core features to provide base information for predictions.
- Apply a variety of transformations, ensuring diversity in nonlinear representations to capture different data interactions.
- Utilize composite transformations (like nested sigmoid and quantile transformations) to create a range of both smooth and abrupt feature variations.

- Non-linear scaling with `minmax_scaler`, which is especially meaningful given the vast range differences in some features.
- Usage of trigonometric and logistic transformations (`cos`, `tanh`) for capturing periodic and non-linear patterns.
- Combination of products and subtractions to introduce interactions between features.
- Additional transformations like `log`, `reciprocal`, and `quan_trans` to handle skewed distributions and bring different features to a common interpretative scale.

This feature set harnesses more comprehensive interaction terms, non-linear transformations, and scaling methods, allowing the model to capture complex patterns in the data effectively and improve predictions for credit card application success.

2026-01-17 16:47:24,374 - INFO - llm output = To design a new feature set based on the provided examples, it's useful to consider creating features that capture non-linear relationships and interactions between existing features. Here are some strategies for the new feature set:

1. **Feature Engineering for Non-Linear Relationships**: Applying transformations like logarithm, reciprocal, and trigonometric functions to highlight non-linear patterns.
2. **Feature Interactions**: Creating new features based on the interaction of two or more existing features, which might reveal complex relationships influencing the target variable.
3. **Combination and Scaling**: Combining features and then applying scaling or transformation to bring them within a suitable range or to emphasize certain relationships.

A newly constructed feature set could look like this:

```plaintext
[f1 log , f3 tanh , f8 f14 f7 - f13 - - f14 f5 - - sqrt , f14 f10 sqrt + stand_scaler , f14 f13 + sqrt , f14 f9 + cos , f8 f9 + sqrt , f6 f4 * log , f14 sqrt sigmoid cos , f14 reciprocal , f14 f12 * stand_scaler , f1 f14 + sqrt , f14 f12 / cos , f2 cos tanh , f1 sigmoid log , f14 f10 sqrt + tanh , f8 f14 f7 - f13 - - f14 f10 - - cos , f14 stand_scaler reciprocal sigmoid , f3 cube , f14 sigmoid reciprocal sqrt , f14 tanh , f9 cos tanh , f8 f14 f7 - f13 - - f14 f9 - - log , f8 f14 f10 - f13 - - f14 f5 - - sqrt , f8 f14 f8 f13 - - - sqrt , f8 f14 f8 - f13 - - f14 f5 - - tanh , f8 f14 f7 - f13 - - f14 f6 - - sqrt , f14 f13 f13 - - - tanh , f14 sqrt sqrt sqrt , f14 f5 - log , f9 f10 f12 * + sqrt , f3 f7 / log , f14 stand_scaler sigmoid cos reciprocal ]
```

**Explanation for New Features**:
- **Transformations and Scaling**: Various features are transformed using functions like logarithm, exponential, trigonometric transformations, and scaling, which often help in normalizing distributions and emphasizing relationships.
- **Interaction Terms**: Multiple terms consider interactions among different features (e.g., the subtraction and addition of multiple feature groups followed by transformations like `cos`, `sin`, or `sqrt`), capturing potential relationships and patterns across features.
- **Emphasis on Non-Linearity**: The application of transformations such as cube and sigmoid for non-linearity exploration, which might be useful given the nature of some financial datasets where non-linear patterns can be prevalent.

This feature set aims to maximize the informative value of the engineered features for better prediction performance. Always remember to validate the performance of new features on the validation or test dataset.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```
[f8, f10, f14, f14 minmax_scaler, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f14 minmax_scaler sqrt, f14 tanh, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f6 tanh, f8 sqrt tanh, f10 sqrt tanh, f14 minmax_scaler tanh, f8 sqrt stand_scaler, f9 sqrt stand_scaler, f10 sqrt stand_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler sqrt stand_scaler, f1 cos, f1 tanh, f8 tanh stand_scaler, f10 tanh stand_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler stand_scaler tanh, f8 sqrt stand_scaler tanh, f9 sqrt stand_scaler tanh, f10 sqrt stand_scaler tanh, f14 minmax_scaler sqrt stand_scaler tanh, f2 sqrt, f6 sqrt]
```

In this feature set, I have:
- Retained and combined useful transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `stand_scaler` with the initial features that seem relevant.
- Emphasized transformations and scaling to harness non-linearities in various features like `f8`, `f10`, and `f14`.
- Integrated features such as `f1`, `f2`, and `f6`, combining transformation techniques for potential improvement in capture of complex relationships in the data that may affect credit card application success.

Here's a consolidated feature set that incorporates various transformations while focusing on non-linear transformations to capture complexity in the data:

```
[f8 , f10 , f14 , f8 sigmoid , f10 sigmoid , f8 sigmoid sigmoid , f10 sigmoid sigmoid , f5 sqrt , f8 sqrt , f10 sqrt , f7 sigmoid sqrt , f8 sigmoid sqrt , f10 sigmoid sqrt , f7 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt , f3 reciprocal , f9 sqrt , f3 reciprocal sqrt , f10 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt , f10 sigmoid sigmoid sqrt sigmoid , f10 sigmoid sqrt sigmoid , f8 sqrt sigmoid , f9 sqrt sigmoid , f10 sqrt sigmoid , f5 f9 + , f8 f14 *, f8 f9 sqrt +, f10 f9 sqrt + ]
```

In this new feature set:
- I retained several significant non-linear transformations that may capture intricate patterns, such as `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, and their combinations.
- I introduced a few interactions by adding or multiplying selected features, like `f5 f9 +` and `f8 f14 *`, which can help in capturing interactions between variables.
- I included some original transformed features like `f3 reciprocal` to explore inverse relationships.
- Overall, this transformation set aims to provide a rich set of features that can capture both linear and non-linear relationships in the data, thereby potentially improving the predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 16:47:50,394 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we want to leverage transformation techniques that help enhance the predictive power while exploring combinations between existing features. Here’s a new synthetically derived feature set, taking inspiration from the given examples and introducing some new operators:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f3 ,f4 ,f6 ,f7 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f13 ,f3 log ,f4 log ,f6 log ,f7 log ,f9 log ,f10 log ,f11 log ,f1 f3 + ,f1 f4 + ,f1 f6 + ,f1 f7 + ,f1 f9 + ,f1 f10 + ,f1 f3 log + ,f1 f4 log + ,f1 f2 log + ,f1 f6 log + ,f3 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f7 tanh f1 + ,f4 tanh f1 +]
```

In this feature set:

1. **Logarithmic Transformations**: We apply logarithmic transformations (log) to some features, which can help in stabilizing variance and achieving a more normal distribution especially for skewed features.

2. **Addition Combinations with Log**: Combining features with their logarithmic transformations can capture interactions between the raw values and their transformations, potentially uncovering nuanced relationships.

3. **Hyperbolic Tangent Transformations**: The `tanh` function helps in mapping features to a range [-1, 1], which can be beneficial for neural networks.

4. **Addition of tanh-transformed features**: Adding `tanh`-transformed features with others may help in capturing non-linear relationships.

These transformations and combinations are designed to help capture non-linearities and interactions that might be beneficial for improving the performance of predictive models on this dataset.

[f8, f10, f14, f14 minmax_scaler, f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f14 minmax_scaler sqrt, f14 tanh, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler stand_scaler, f8 sqrt stand_scaler, f10 sqrt stand_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler sqrt stand_scaler, f8 tanh, f10 tanh, f14 minmax_scaler tanh, f8 sqrt tanh, f10 sqrt tanh, f14 minmax_scaler sqrt tanh, f8 stand_scaler tanh, f9 stand_scaler tanh, f10 stand_scaler tanh, f14 minmax_scaler stand_scaler tanh, f8 sqrt stand_scaler tanh, f10 sqrt stand_scaler tanh, f14 minmax_scaler sqrt stand_scaler tanh, f8 cos, f10 cos, f14 minmax_scaler cos, f8 sigm
oid, f10 sigmoid, f14 minmax_scaler sigmoid, f8 cos sigmoid, f10 cos sigmoid, f14 minmax_scaler cos sigmoid]
```

### Explanation:
- Expanded usage of `sqrt`, `cos`, and `sigmoid` functions which often help in normalization and diminution of outliers.
- Leverages both `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to effectively normalize or scale the features.
- Combines various transformations sequentially to capture complex non-linear relationships. 
- Integrates traditional transformations such as `tanh` which can compress the range of outputs between -1 and 1, which could stabilize model input/output.
- Prioritizes the combination of transformations that differentially affect features without distorting their intrinsic variational information.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

2026-01-17 16:48:10,616 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictive performance by using feature engineering, we can create a new feature set that harnesses the transformations discussed in the provided examples. Below is a proposed feature set, using various transformations to augment the dataset:

In this feature set:

- I retained the transformed features from the first example which use sigmoid activations, as they can capture non-linear patterns and many-layered transformations of some features might provide a complex yet meaningful input.
- I included scaling transformations from the second example (standard scaler and min-max scaler applied to `f13`) to ensure features are on a comparable scale and take advantage of scale-based significance, which is critical in models like regression or distance-based approaches.
- Combined sigmoid and various scaled versions as they could possibly capture different dimensions and scaling effects on the data that enhance the predictive ability further.

```

### Explanation for Feature Set:
1. **Base Features**: Retaining features like `f1` (Gender), `f3` (Married), `f5` (Industry), and others as they serve as essential discriminators.
2. **Square Root Transformations**: Applying square root transformations to account for non-linear relationships. For 'Age' (`f1`), 'YearsEmployed' (`f2`), and others, these can help reduce skewness.
3. **Reciprocal and Min-Max Scaling**: Use these transformations to explore nonlinear relationships and contain feature variances within a bounded range, helping improve model stability.
4. **Tanh and Quantile Transformation**: Capture non-linearity; for example, 'Income' (`f14`) with transformations like Tanh and Quantile.
5. **Interaction Terms**: Multiplying and dividing features such as `f10` and `f8` to capture interactions between important predictors.
6. **Combination of Improved Features**: Integrating chosen transformations from both examples to create a more robust feature engineering process, prioritizing the degrees of their transformations for enhanced predictability.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:48:26,444 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by combining insights and transformations from the given examples, let's construct a new set that utilizes some advanced transformations and combinations. The latter example suggests an inclination towards combination using arithmetic operations and deep transformations using multiple sigmoid and square root operations. Here’s a final transformed feature set:

```plaintext
[f8, f10, f14, f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f14 sqrt, f8 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f14 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid sqrt, f10 sigmoid sqrt, f14 sigmoid sqrt, f5 sqrt, f5 f9 +, f10 f9 sqrt +, f2 f3 *, f10 sigmoid sqrt sigmoid, f10 f14 +, f9 sqrt sigmoid, f8 f14 *, f2 f6 tanh sqrt, f3 reciprocal, f8 f9 sqrt +, f10 f7 sqrt *, f14 f10 sqrt /, f8 f3 reciprocal *]
```

In this set:
- Retained features f8, f10, and f14 for their common presence in both examples, suggesting they are important.
- Applied fundamental transformations like square roots and sigmoids to multiple features.
- Included arithmetic and product combinations (e.g., `f8 f14 *`, `f5 f9 +`, `f14 f10 sqrt /`) which signal complexity and often boost non-linear models.
- Added complex nested transformations such as `f2 f6 tanh sqrt` and `f10 sigmoid sqrt sigmoid` to capture potential interactions and non-linearity in the data.
- Continued with reciprocal and arithmetic combinations involving transformed features to enhance feature interactions.

This new set aims to leverage complex interactions and transformations that may capture hidden patterns, potentially improving prediction performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a suggested feature set in postfix notation:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14,
f0 sqrt, f1 quan_trans, f2 cos, f3 cos, f4 cos, f5 cos, f6 cos, f7 cos, f8 cos,

f0 f1 sqrt *, f9 f11 sin +, f1 f5 stand_scaler +,
f7 sin f8 cos +, f6 f9 minmax_scaler
]
```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: Retain all original features to maintain essential information.
- **Mathematical Transformations**: Apply `sqrt` to some features to reduce skewness.
- **Standard Scaler & Min-Max Scaler**: Normalize feature `f14` and combine with `f1` post-scaling.
- **Trigonometric Transformations**: Use `cos` on a range of features for potential periodic behavior, combined with `sin` on others for non-linearity.
- **Combining Features**: Utilize addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to highlight interactions between features.
- **Quantile Transformation**: Apply on feature `f1` for robust scaling for potentially non-Gaussian distributions.

This approach offers a diverse set of features that balance between preserving original data, applying scaling and non-linear transformations, and leveraging interactions. This should enhance the model's capability to capture complex patterns in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

This feature set uses a combination of the original and transformed features, applying square root and sigmoid transformations to potentially highlight non-linear relationships and interactions. It also includes new combinations such as adding transformed features as a way to introduce interactions. This type of feature engineering can help a model better capture the underlying patterns in the data that relate to the target variable, which in this case, is the success of credit card applications.

### Explanation
1. **Basic Features and Subtractions**: The feature set begins with the basic `f8` feature and incorporates subtractions from both examples.
2. **Non-linear Transformations and Interactions**: Non-linear transformations such as `sigmoid` and `tanh` are used based on differences to capture interactions.
3. **Compound Features**: Complex interactions are formed by combining subtractions and applying functions like `sin`.
4. **Combinations of Different Features**: There is an attempt to capture interactions between diverse feature groupings to improve the model's ability to learn intricate patterns.
  
By implementing this set of transformed features, the aim is to capture underlying patterns related to successful credit card applications that are not obvious in the original feature space.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:49:35,940 - INFO - llm output = To create a feature set that builds upon the given examples, let's identify some potentially useful transformations and combinations utilizing the available operations. The important consideration is creating features that could capture non-linear relationships and interactions between original features. Here's a proposed feature set:

1. Start from some base features: [f8, f10, f14]
2. Leveraging non-linear transformations: 
   - Apply `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, `cube` etc. on various features that seem to have potential leverage according to the data.
   - Use combined interactions for exploring latent feature relationships like `*`, `+` etc.
3. Include diverse feature transformations to capture multiple angles of feature interactions like `f8 f14 *`, `f8 f10 *`, `f9 sqrt`, different forms of `sigmoid` and `sqrt` transformations indicating layered non-linearity and interaction.

Here's the proposed enhanced feature set:

[f1, f3, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f2 cos, f2 tanh, f7 sqrt, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f12 sigmoid, f2 sin, f3 cos, f13 sin, f13 square, f13 f2 *, f2 cos cos, f5 tanh tanh, f3 f1 * sin, f8 tanh tanh tanh, f9 tanh tanh tanh, f10 tanh tanh tanh, f2 cos, f2 tanh, f2 sigmoid]
```

Changes and justifications:
1. **Aggregated useful functions:** Consistent use of `tanh`, `cos`, and `sigmoid` due to their ability to capture non-linear patterns.
2. **Enrichment with non-linear transformations:** Utilized `tanh`, `cos`, and `sin` on selected features to enhance representational capabilities.
3. **Incorporation of mathematical operations:** Multiply certain transformed features to explore interaction effects.
4. **Complex transformations:** Explored deeper application of `sigmoid` and `tanh` to certain features, aiming to capture intricate data patterns.

This involves using transformations that explore non-linearity and interactions but maintain a balance to prevent overfitting.

Here is a combined and refined version of the feature transformations:

```plaintext

```

Explanations:
- Retained basic features like `f8`, `f9`, `f10`, `f14`, and `f13 f14 -` for continuity and potential direct relevance.
- Included cube transformations (`f8 cube`, `f9 cube`, `f10 cube`) as they can help model non-linear relationships strongly.
- Maintained subtractive interactions with `f14` as they signify crucial differences from income `f14`.
- Added `f2 sqrt` to inspect the relationship of square roots of Age.
- Included `f10 tanh` and `f8 sigmoid` to explore non-linearities in CreditScore and YearsEmployed.
- Introduced `f12 tanh` to analyze how citizenship status affects predictions.

This combination attempts to capture complex relationships while still providing some simplification over the second set offered, aiming for both improved predictive performance and better interpretability.

Newly added terms:
- Added f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh to introduce non-linear transformations that tend to handle skewness and create features that could help in distinguishing complex relationships.
- Added combinations with 'cube' to explore higher-order interactions and potential non-linear effects in different scales.
- Added f14 tanh stand_scaler cube to see the impact of using the tanh transformation followed by scaling and cubic non-linearity, potentially capturing intricate patterns.

This feature set aims to leverage a variety of transformation techniques to creatively derive hidden patterns from the original features, further supporting the prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f8, f10, f14]

2026-01-17 16:50:00,918 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, let's aim to construct features that capture more useful transformations and interactions among the original features while extending beyond the previous examples. We'll still rely on non-linear operations and combinations:

In this improved set, additional transformations like `log`, `cube`, and new combinations involving products and sums have been included. These are designed to capture complex interactions among features and non-linear relationships, potentially providing better predictive power for modeling the success of credit card applications.

2026-01-17 16:50:11,346 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for the prediction task, we'll incorporate transformations that help in capturing non-linear relationships and scaling, while also considering the additional preview of feature transformations provided. Here's a more advanced feature set inspired by the given examples:

```python
[f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f1 tanh, f2 log, f3 cube, f4 minmax_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 reciprocal, f7 sigmoid, f8 sqrt, f9 square, f10 reciprocal, f11 quadratic, f12 cube, f13 sqrt, f14 sigmoid, (f1 f3 +) sigmoid, (f2 f9 +) tanh, (f4 f5 +) log]
```

Explanation of the new features:
1. **Individual transformations**:
   - Use of transformations like `tanh`, `log`, `cube`, `sigmoid`, and `reciprocal` to help normalize and capture complex relationships. 
   - Use of `sqrt`, `square`, and `quadratic` transformations to aid in capturing deviations and non-linear patterns.

2. **Combining existing features**:
   - New combinations of features are created using basic arithmetic operations to explore possible interactions between features, which can be further transformed.
  
3. **Scaling**:
   - `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` applied to specific features for normalized scales and centering.

By blending transformations and basic combinations of features, this feature set aims to capture potential interactions and non-linearities among the original data attributes, providing richer inputs for the predictive modeling task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:50:15,649 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new and potentially more informative feature set based on the provided examples, a good balance of direct feature usage, along with transformations that normalize, refine, and reveal nonlinear relationships in the data, can be helpful. Here is a transformed version that combines aspects from both examples:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f13 tanh ,f10 sqrt ,f0 f1 + cos ,f14 f13 quan_trans * ,f7 stand_scaler ,f4 f5 - ,f1 f8 /]
```

This feature set uses a combination of:

1. **Feature Scaling and Normalization:** Min-max scaling and standard scaling are used to bring the values into a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values.

2. **Non-linear Transformations:** Application of functions such as `tanh`, `sqrt`, and `cos` to capture nonlinear relationships.

3. **Feature Interactions:** Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are used to potentially capture interactions between original features.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction and Selection:** While maintaining a broad use of original features, I choose those that could be important due to domain understanding or statistical significance.

Note: Since you can apply multiple transformations, I have chosen a mixture that balances the number of new features with potentially complex derived values across both quantitative expansions and simple feature combinations. Each transformation aims to preserve or reveal information predictive of credit application success.
