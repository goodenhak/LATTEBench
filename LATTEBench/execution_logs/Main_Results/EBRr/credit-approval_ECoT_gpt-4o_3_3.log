Here's a breakdown of the thought process:

1. **Feature Selection:**
   - Most original features are retained as they encompass relevant information.
   - Selected transformations based on data consistency and potential predictive importance.

2. **Transformation Considerations:**
   - **sqrt, cos, log, reciprocal, tanh:** Applied to numerical features to capture non-linear relationships and stabilize variance.
   - **Product of Features:** Introducing interactions between features for capturing complex patterns.

3. **Standardization and Quantile Transformations:**
   - Applied to adjust for feature distribution issues and further stabilize variance, especially combining them with other transformations.

2026-01-17 16:36:34,655 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two new feature set examples provided, I will create a better feature set by leveraging the strengths of both versions. 

The first example focuses heavily on quantile transformations, which can be helpful in normalizing the data distribution. The second example retains many original features and introduces a simple addition operation at the end.

A potential combination of these two approaches would be to balance the normalization and retain some original features along with meaningful interactions. Additionally, to make the feature set more informative, logical transformations like scaling, interaction terms, and advanced mathematical functions can be integrated where useful. Here's a potential example:

[f0 minmax_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 sqrt, f3 *, f4 cube, f5 log, f6 tanh, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f11 reciprocal, f12 * f6, f13 f3 +, f14 cube, f0 f14 * minmax_scaler quan_trans]

Here, I've included:

- Various normalization techniques (min-max scaling, standard scaling, quantile transformation).
- Basic mathematical transformations that might reveal hidden patterns (sqrt, cube, tanh, reciprocal, log).
- Interaction and combination of certain features to potentially uncover relationships (multiply and add specific features).
 
This balanced approach should provide a meaningful feature set while preserving essential aspects of original and transformed features.

f8, f10, f14, f7\text{ quan\_trans}, f8\text{ quan\_trans}, f10\text{ quan\_trans}, f14\text{ quan\_trans quan\_trans}, f14\text{ cube}\, (f8 \text{ + } f10), f14\text{ quan\_trans}\, /\, f10, f8\text{ quan\_trans quan\_trans}, f10\text{ quan\_trans quan\_trans}, f14\text{ quan\_trans quan\_trans quan\_trans}, f8\text{ quan\_trans}\, *\, f9\text{ quan\_trans}, f14\text{ sqrt quan\_trans}, f7\text{ quan\_trans quan\_trans}\, /\, f9\text{ quan\_trans}, f14\text{ cube quan\_trans}\, *\, f10\text{ quan\_trans}, f14\text{ minmax\_scaler}, f9\text{ quan\_trans quan\_trans}\, +\, f8\text{ quan\_trans quan\_trans quan\_trans}
\]

In this transformation:
- I've focused on combinations and additional transformations that explore interactions between features that are related to employment (\(f7\)), prior defaults (\(f8\)), employment status (\(f10\)), and income (\(f14\)).
- Feature combinations leverage nonlinear transformations (e.g., cube, sqrt) and the quantile transformation applied multiple times.
- Introduction of new features that represent ratios (e.g., \(f14\,/\,f10\)) and products (e.g., \(f8 \text{ quan\_trans}\, *\, f9 \text{ quan\_trans}\)), which might capture complex interactions that can improve classification outcomes.

Here's a suggestion:

```plaintext
[f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f14 cube, f14 sqrt, f14 sqrt quan_trans, f14 f14 sqrt *, f14 cube quan_trans, f8 quan_trans quan_trans, f9 quan_trans quan_trans, f10 quan_trans quan_trans, f7 quan_trans quan_trans, f14 cube quan_trans quan_trans, f2 quan_trans quan_trans, f5 quan_trans quan_trans, f14 sqrt quan_trans, f14 sqrt quan_trans quan_trans, f14 f14 sqrt * quan_trans, f8 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f9 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f10 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f9 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f2 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f5 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f10 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f14 f7 * sqrt, f14 f14 sqrt * quan_trans]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Basic features:** Retained from both examples: `f7, f8, f9, f10, f14`.
2. **Basic transformations:** Use of `quan_trans` across features like `f7, f8, f9, f10`.
3. **Complex transformations:** Incorporated cube and square root transformations, along with combinations using multiplication to capture nonlinear interactions, especially involving important features like `f14`.
4. **Higher-order transformations:** Added multiple layers of `quan_trans` to some features and complex combinations like `f14 f14 sqrt *` to potentially capture intricate patterns within the data.

These transformations aim to enhance feature representation by capturing potential nonlinear relationships and interactions between features relevant to predicting credit card application success.

Here's a new feature set:

```

```

Key changes include:

- Using combinations of `sqrt`, `cos`, `tanh` along with `quan_trans` and `cube` transformations to potentially unearth more non-linear relationships that were previously hidden or less pronounced, useful in capturing complex patterns in the feature data.
- The integration of trigonometric transformations such as `cos` and `tanh` that might lead to different scaling and sensitivity to feature interactions.
- Combined these transformations with quintuple applications on certain features to deeply extract variations.

2026-01-17 16:37:11,051 - INFO - llm output = To come up with a better feature set leveraging both examples you've given, I'll focus on incorporating transformations and ensuring variety, while possibly emphasizing interactions and importance of certain features based on general intuition in credit score modeling.

Here's a new feature set:
```
[f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f14 ,f2 f8 * ,f3 f9 * ,f0 f14 * ,f3 tanh ,f8 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f14 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f13 sin ,f14 quan_trans quan_trans ,f2 stand_scaler ,f11 f14 minmax_scaler * ,f1 quan_trans ,f0 quan_trans ,f2 quan_trans ,f3 quan_trans ,f9 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f14 quan_trans quan_trans ,f13 cos sqrt ,f1 quan_trans sqrt ,f2 sin ,f8 cube ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f1 log ,f2 f7 / ,f3 f8 /]
```

### Key Considerations:
1. **Scaling and Normalization**: Using `quan_trans`, `minmax_scaler`, and `stand_scaler` for various features to help with normalization.
2. **Interactions**: Including products of potentially important features such as income (`f14`), debt (`f2`), and years employed (`f8`).
3. **Mathematical Transformations**: Applying trigonometric (`sin`, `cos`) and other nonlinear transformations (`sqrt`, `cube`, `log`) to model nonlinear relationships.
4. **Feature Combinations**: Attempting to leverage operations like multiplication and division to potentially capture interactions between features.

Please validate this new feature set with empirical analysis as this transformation is hypothetical and would require cross-validation with your dataset to ensure real improvement in predictive power.

**Explanation:**
- Enhanced feature transformations with operations like `tanh`, `sqrt`, `cube`, `reciprocal`, and `log` to cater to non-linear trends.
- Balanced pre-processing using `quan_trans`.
- Incorporated trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, which may reveal latent patterns in data.
- Included `f0 tanh` for better feature scaling, especially if this represents a categorical or binary variable.
- Ensured both linear and non-linear transformations are represented for a comprehensive feature engineering approach.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:37:23,249 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set derived from the given examples, we need to consider transformations that can lead to more informative features for the downstream tasks. We want to include transformations that capture nonlinear relationships, interactions, and scaled versions of features that capture the essential signal in the data.

Here's a new, improved feature set, combining and extending transformations from the provided examples:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f2 sqrt ,f7 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f13 cos ,f1 quan_trans ,f14 cos ,f14 f2 * ,f13 f7 * ,f8 f9 * sqrt ,f1 f14 cos * ,f1 f13 * stand_scaler ,f5 f10 quan_trans * ,f0 f9 tanh * ,f14 quan_trans tanh ,f7 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal ,f2 log ,f8 sin ,f11 f9 * log ,f3 f14 / stand_scaler ,f9 f2 * sqrt ,f10 f6 cube ,f1 f3 f6 * / ,f0 f14 sigmoid ,f13 sin ,f8 tanh]
```

**Explanation**:
- I've retained many of the features and transformations from both lists to ensure we capture significant trends and patterns while ensuring non-linear dependencies.
- Added `f8 sin` and `f13 sin` to explore cyclic patterns in employment and citizenship-related features.
- Added new interactions and transformations that could capture unconventional patterns such as `f11 f9 * log`, `f3 f14 / stand_scaler`, and the scaled interaction terms like `f10 f6 cube` and `f1 f3 f6 * /`.
- Sigmoid, tanh, and reciprocal transformations are used to capture nonlinear rate changes, useful in intensifying or diminishing feature signals.
- These combinations and transformations are crafted to ensure a richer set of features, potentially capturing complex relationships in this credit card application problem.

Explanation of additions and changes:
1. Used `sin`, `log`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `reciprocal` transformations on relevant features as they often capture non-linear relationships and can standardize features more effectively.
2. Expanded the applications of `cube` to capture cubic relationships within the data.
3. Combined `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` with other transformations to ensure that feature scaling sufficiently stabilizes feature contributions.

These transformations potentially provide improved mathematical representations to reveal complex patterns in the data that are useful for predicting credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:37:43,393 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given two feature sets, I'll create a new improved feature set using the provided feature engineering techniques:

Starting with the two examples:
Example 1 includes a diverse set of transformations including square root, quantile transformation, and interaction terms like addition and multiplication, which capture non-linear relationships between features. It uses techniques like standard scaling and quantile transformation, which can help in normalizing and dealing with skewed data.

Example 2 contains cosine transformations and focuses more on individual feature transformations but lacks interaction terms and advanced transformations seen in Example 1.

To create a better feature set, I'll combine these strategies, focusing on capturing interactions between features and providing a robust representation through scaling and nonlinear transformations.

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f2 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f1 quan_trans, f13 stand_scaler, f14 f13 +, f14 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f14 f13 + quan_trans, f1 f14 f13 + *, f1 f8 quan_trans *, f1 f9 quan_trans *, f1 f14 quan_trans *, f8 f9 * sqrt, f14 f2 *, f13 f7 *, f13 cos, f1 f8 * tanh, f2 f9/ f8 sqrt, f1 f13 cube] 

This feature set focuses on leveraging both individual feature transformations and interactions between features, thus aiming to capture nuanced patterns that improve predictions. It integrates cube and tanh transformations to capture potentially complex interactions, as well as the division and square root combination for capturing ratios that could be relevant.

2026-01-17 16:37:57,367 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, let's combine various transformations and select meaningful combinations that could be beneficial in predicting credit card application success. Here’s a proposed transformation feature set:

- Start with raw features: f8, f9, f10, f14
- Apply different transformations: quan_trans, cube, tanh
- Combine features using arithmetic operations: +, *, and transformation layering

Here's the new feature set:

```
[f9, f10, f14 cube, f10 f14 +, f9 f10 + f14 cube +, f8 tanh, f8 cube, f8 quan_trans, f8 f9 +, f8 f9 + f10 *, f8 f9 + f14 cube *, f8 tanh f8 +, f9 quan_trans, f10 cube, f14 quan_trans cube, f14 cube quan_trans *
```

Explanation:
- We use cube transformation on f14 as it significantly transforms income values, beneficial for capturing non-linear relationships.
- Combine f9 and f10 (CreditScore and PriorDefault) directly as they might capture financial habits/patterns.
- Use the `tanh` function on f8, which can handle income variability well and fit within typical values.
- Apply `quan_trans` transformation to earlier features and then multiply across combined various layers for better interaction handling.
- Use cube transformation and apply it within arithmetic expressions to potentially capture intricate interactions.

These transformations and combinations aim to capture intricate relationships and interactions that could better predict successful credit card applications.

2026-01-17 16:38:06,182 - INFO - llm output = Given your task is to predict credit card application success, I'll generate a new feature set based on the provided feature examples using various transformations. I'll aim to create meaningful features that capture complex patterns possibly related to credit scoring:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, 
f2 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f13 cos, f1 quan_trans, f14 cos, 
f14 f2 *, f13 f7 *, f8 f9 * sqrt, f1 f14 cos *, 
f1 f13 * stand_scaler, f5 f10 quan_trans *, f2 f8 * log, 
f0 f9 minmax_scaler *, f14 quan_trans tanh, f7 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, 
f1 f9 sin * cube, f2 log, f9 minmax_scaler tanh, f14 f13 * sqrt]
```

**Explanation of Transformations:**

1. **Logarithm (`f2 log`, `f2 f8 * log`)**: Given the importance of financial data, using the log transformation can help in dealing with skewness and emphasizing relative differences.

2. **Square Root (`f7 sqrt`, `f9 sqrt`, `f10 sqrt`, `f14 f13 * sqrt`)**: This transformation can help reduce the effect of extreme values (e.g., high debt or income).

3. **Cosine and Tanh**: Non-linear transformations like `cos` and `tanh` might capture complex interactions better.

4. **Reciprocal (`f7 reciprocal`, `f10 reciprocal`)**: Useful for reducing the effect of high magnitude values (e.g., high years employed).

5. **Scale and Normalize (Min-Max Scaling and Standard Scaler)**: Scaling continuous variables like credit score and age can help improve the model's convergence and performance.

6. **Product and Composite Features (`f14 f2 *`, `f13 f7 *`, `f8 f9 * sqrt`, `f5 f10 quan_trans *`, `f1 f13 * stand_scaler`, `f0 f9 minmax_scaler *`, `f9 minmax_scaler tanh`)**: Combining features and applying transformations to capture interactions.

7. **Sin & Cube on Non-linear Interactions**: Complex transformations (`f1 f9 sin * cube`) might reveal intricate patterns beneficial for prediction.

By generating these composite and transformed features, we potentially improve the modeling capability by providing better feature representations for predicting credit card application success.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Transformations**: Some features underwent standard transformations like `minmax_scaler` or `stand_scaler` to ensure scaled input, good for models sensitive to value ranges (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks).

2. **Complex Transformations**:
   - **Nonlinear scaling**: `tanh`, `log`, and `sqrt` are used to handle nonlinear relations and compress/enhance ranges.
   - **Interaction terms**: Multiplying or adding several transformed features (e.g., `f8 f2 + tanh`) captures interactions.
   - **Reciprocal & Cube**: Used for skewed data or to emphasize extreme values in transformations (e.g., `f7 f14 * sqrt`).

3. **Enhanced Interactions**:
   - Combining multiple transformations on `f13` and `f14` frequently indicates a stronger focus on specific features.
   - Several product and sum-of-features after transformation (`f13 f14 sqrt * tanh`) might capture intense interactions, valuable for decision surface complexity.

These transformations help in capturing complex patterns that may influence the success rate, considering correlations, scaled importance, and feature interactions.

### Explanation of transformations applied:

- **Square** and **Cube** on features: This emphasizes variances and captures non-linear relationships that might exist between the original features and the target.
- **Log** and **Reciprocal**: Applied to scale heavy-tailed distributions and handle large values better.
- **Tanh** and **Sigmoid**: Smooth out extreme values for features that might skew predictions.
- **Standard Scaler**: Aligns features around zero mean and unit variance, which benefits models sensitive to magnitude of features.
- **Minmax Scaler**: Compresses features into a tight range, useful for features operating within large bounds.
- **Quantile Transform with Standard Scaling**: An advanced transformation that turns features into a Gaussian-like distribution and scales them subsequently.
- **Basic Algebraic operations**: Combining and altering features through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to create complex interaction terms that capture unique relations between data points.

These transformations aim to enhance the representational power of the features and ultimately improve model performance.

```

In this improved feature set, we have:

- Applied more functions like `sqrt`, `square`, `cube`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and `cos` to additional features to capture specific mathematical transformations and interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a new feature set that incorporates both transformations and some complex combinations:

```
[f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f13 ,f14 ,f13 sin ,f2 tanh ,f14 quan_trans ,f13 cos ,f1 quan_trans ,f10 f8 + ,f1 f2 + ,f3 f5 + ,f7 f8 + f7 f8 + * quan_trans, f8 f7 + f8 f7 + * quan_trans ,f8 f10 + quan_trans quan_trans, f8 f14 cube + ,f13 quan_trans f8 + quan_trans, f7 f8 + cos ,f8 tanh ,f2 f8 * quan_trans f13 sin + ,f14 cube f10 + f9 *]
```

### Explanation:

- Retain some of the initial features to ensure the basic information is preserved (like `f1`, `f2`, ... `f14`).
- Incorporate transformations such as `sin` and `tanh` as exploratory features to handle potential nonlinear relationships.
- Use combination features like `f10 f8 +` and scaled, trigonometric, or higher-order transformations for complexity.
- Retain complex combinations from both provided examples, showcasing interactions between features and additional transformations. 

These transformations assume numeric features are standardized or normalized accordingly for operations that require specific ranges (e.g., trigonometric, logarithmic, and reciprocal operations). The goal is to generate more diverse attributes that capture intricate patterns awithin the existing dataset to improve the model's ability to discern successful credit card applicants.

Here's a feature set that blends elements from both examples and aims to optimize the new feature space:

```

```

Explanation:

1. I prioritized using the mathematical transformations (sqrt, cube, reciprocal) that help in capturing non-linear relationships and variances.

2. Integrated advanced transformations like `quan_trans`, `cos reciprocal`, and `sigmoid` for smooth scaling and normalization effects.

3. Included composite operations like `f8 f9 * sqrt` to capture interaction terms between features.

4. Combined elements such as `f2 f14 + /` which highlight relational dynamics between scaled features.

5. Focused on transformations that facilitate data scaling and variance reduction, such as `minmax_scaler`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and explicitly used operations like `f14 square` for variance capture.

By leveraging these transformations, it's possible to enrich the data representation, potentially improving model prediction performance on the task of credit card application success.

2026-01-17 16:39:04,518 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, we want to combine and transform features in a way that potentially enhances their predictive power for the success of credit card applications. The latter example suggests a preference for min-max scaling and square transformations, while the former includes a variety of transformations such as square roots, trigonometric operations, and logarithms. Considering both examples, here's a new feature set that applies diverse transformations while emphasizing scaling and nonlinear transformations:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f14 square, f7 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f1 cos, f14 tanh, f2 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f13 minmax_scaler, f1 sin minmax_scaler, f0 f14 reciprocal *, f2 f7 tanh *, f1 f13 quan_trans cube *, f14 f2 log, f8 f9 cos *, f4 f13 * tanh, f12 f3 minmax_scaler, f1 f10 reciprocal *, f1 f5 * sqrt, f7 minmax_scaler square, f3 f9 sin log, f0 f14 reciprocal * sqrt]

This feature set attempts to strike a balance between transformation diversity and potential predictive power, incorporating both scaling techniques and nonlinear transformations that may capture complex relationships.

Here is a suggested improved feature set:

```
[f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f14 sqrt, f13 quan_trans, f14 sqrt quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, f2 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f12 quan_trans, f13 square quan_trans, f14 sqrt quan_trans quan_trans, f14 stand_scaler quan_trans, f14 quan_trans quan_trans, f13 cos, f14 sqrt quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f14 stand_scaler quan_trans quan_trans, f14 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans, f2 quan_trans quan_trans, f6 quan_trans quan_trans, f7 quan_trans quan_trans, f8 quan_trans quan_trans, f9 quan_trans quan_trans, f10 quan_trans quan_trans, f13 f14 sqrt * quan_trans, f13 cos quan_trans, f14 minmax_scaler, f14 log, f2 f13 + sqrt, f6 tanh, f13 cube, f14 reciprocal quan_trans, f14 / f13 quan_trans quan_trans, f2 f6 * tanh, f7 sqrt, f10 reciprocal, f12 f13 * quan_trans]
```

Explanation and improvements:
1. Combined indicators: `f2 f6 * tanh` - Capture interaction between income and employment, which can potentially signify financial stability when multiplied and transformed.
2. Square root transformation for `f7`, enhancing data normalization.
3. Reciprocal transformation for `f10` to emphasize low driver’s license possession.
4. Interaction and transformation for citizenship multiplied by ethnicity: `f12 f13 * quan_trans`, capturing potential socio-demographic effects.

Explanation:
- The expressions build upon existing complex relationships (interaction terms, nonlinear transformations).
- `f1 f9 sqrt * +` adds the effect of interacting `Age` with `CreditScore`.
- `(f1 f14 cos * f10 reciprocal * +) sqrt` introduces complex interactions between features.
- `f1 f13 f2 + cube` leverages a polynomial expansion with `Age`, `ZipCode`, and `Debt`.
- `f1 f8 f9 * tanh` captures interaction between `Age`, `YearsEmployed`, and `CreditScore` with the `tanh` function, extracting potential non-linear relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

Here is an improved feature set in postfix expression format:

```

```

### Explanation of New Additions:
- `f1 f8 log *`: A log transformation of a feature multiplied by another can help exploit multiplicative relationships, which are often beneficial when dealing with income-related features.
- `f2 f8 reciprocal *`: Introduces inverse relationships to potentially emphasize differences in scale or inverse correlations.
- `f6 f7 * minmax_scaler`: Scales the product of two features to ensure that the feature range is consistent across various feature interactions.
- `f14 f9 sqrt /`: Combines scaled features in a ratio to assess how certain scaled attributes interact.
- `f0 f1 * f2 sqrt +`: Multiplies and then adds to integrate linear and non-linear transformations for capturing more complex patterns.

These transformations, with their varied use of functional transformations and combinations, can help uncover underlying patterns in the data which might improve the model's predictive performance.

**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Basic feature inclusion:** First, include essential features directly because they might have direct predictive power. These are the features from f0 to f14.

2. **Feature interactions and transformations:** Incorporate combinations of features and transformations to discover potential non-linear relationships or interactions:
   - Multiplications (*) capture interaction effects between features, which can reveal synergistic relationships.
   - Additions (+) of features can be useful where combined magnitude of features is informative.
   - Use of trigonometric functions (cos, sin, tanh) can capture periodicity or cyclical relationships.
   - Logarithmic and square root transformations can handle skewness and variance issues, potentially highlighting important patterns.
   - Scaling transformations (minmax_scaler, stand_scaler) to normalize feature values and allow unbiased influence.
   - Cube and reciprocal functions capture extreme non-linearity, potentially useful for extreme value sensitivity.

3. **Specific transformations based on given examples:** 
   - Functions like `cos` and `tanh` are used post-interaction, as suggested in examples, pointing towards potential non-linear relationships.
   - Complex interactions such as `f1 f5 sin * tanh` introduce non-linear transformations while combining features, aiming for reveal of low-frequency components in data.
   - Utilizing important features like employment status, prior default, or income effectively based on interaction outcomes with other features like age or credit score.

By utilizing all these transformations and interactions, it increases the chance of capturing hidden patterns that could contribute to accurately predicting credit card application success.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here is a better feature set derived from the examples:

This feature set builds upon the transformations used in the examples:

1. Includes fundamental features (`f0` to `f14`) to maintain essential information.
2. Applies diverse transformations (`sqrt`, `log`, `cos`, `sin`, `tanh`, `cube`) to capture nonlinear patterns.
3. Implements scaling methods (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`) for normalization, enhancing model performance.
4. Creates interaction terms (`f14 f13 * sqrt f1 *`, `f0 f9 minmax_scaler *`) to explore interdependencies between features, potentially uncovering associative trends crucial in predicting credit card application success.
5. Lowers redundancy by selectively utilizing operations that yield the most distinctive information, like `tanh` for squashing effects and `reciprocal` for inverse relations.

### Explanation for New Features:

1. **`f6 f10 * log`**: Exploring the interaction between `Industry` and the square root of `CreditScore` through logarithmic scaling can identify multiplicative interactions.
2. **`f3 f4 + sqrt`**: Combining `Married` and `BankCustomer` before applying a square root can reveal combined effects of personal status and banking relationships.
3. **`f11 f12 / sqrt sqrt`**: Analyzing the ratio of `DriversLicense` to `Citizen` gives insight into legitimacy status under square root transformations, which could correlate to credit card success.
4. **`f0 f14 * minmax_scaler`**: Scaling a combination of `Gender` and `Income`, could highlight gender-disparities in income-related predictions.
5. **`f13 f1 * f10 sqrt`**: Engaging `ZipCode` and transformed `Age` with a square root `CreditScore` gives geographic and age contextual performance insights.
6. **`f5 f8 / tanh`**: Transform interaction between `Industry` and `PriorDefault` using hyperbolic tangent provides bias correction for outliers and non-linear spread.

These new features are leveraging combinations, scaling, and transformations to extract deeper insights and possibly capture subtle relationships within the data that could help improve the downstream predictions for successful credit card applications.

Let's create a new, better-feature set:

```plaintext

```

Enhancements:
- Incorporated `f14 square` to emphasize potential non-linearities.
- Included `f10 stand_scaler` to normalize and adjust the scale of the feature.
- Combined `f14 log minmax_scaler` to manage skewness and scale-boundary interaction.
- Added `f13 tanh quan_trans` to capture non-linear responses and balance feature distribution.
- Fused `f13 f14 + sqrt quan_trans` to explore potential interaction benefits.

Answer: 1

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

]
```

### Explanations:

1. **Interaction Terms**: Interactions like `f14 f2 *`, `f13 f7 *`, and `f6 f2 / sqrt` are included to capture the influence of joint feature effects.
2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Functions such as `cos`, `tanh`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `reciprocal` are used for non-linearity, capturing subtler patterns.
3. **Combining Features**: New synthetic features like `f1 f13 * stand_scaler` and `f14 f2 f6 * + log` capture merged effects, followed by scaling/neural non-linearity.
4. **Statistical Scaling and Binning**: Techniques like `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler` help standardize and occasionally remap feature distributions for consistency and better separation in feature space.
5. **Significant Mathematical Transformations**: Using `sigmoid` and `cube` helps in handling extreme feature values and normalizing outputs, suitable for likelihood estimation.

This feature set provides a comprehensive, varied representation that should enhance model learning and prediction accuracy for determining credit card application success.
