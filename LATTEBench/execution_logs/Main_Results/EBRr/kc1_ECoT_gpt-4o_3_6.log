you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:57:05,717 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we'll aim to introduce some transformations and combinations that could capture potential interactions or non-linear relationships more effectively. Here's a new feature set proposal:

```
[f8 ,f10 ,f12 ,f5 f8 * ,f5 f10 * ,f5 f12 * ,f9 f8 * ,f9 f10 * ,f9 f12 * ,f6 f9 + ,f7 f9 + ,f10 f9 + ,f17 f9 + ,f8 f10 + ,f8 f12 + ,f10 f12 + ,f6 f8 * ,f7 f8 * ,f17 f8 * ,f9 f9 sqrt ,f8 f8 sqrt ,f10 f10 sqrt ,f12 f12 sqrt ,f5 f9 log ,f8 f9 log ,f10 f9 log ,f12 f9 log ,f5 f8 log ,f5 f10 log ,f5 f12 log ,f6 f9 f8 + * ,f7 f9 f10 + * ,f17 f9 f12 + * ,f9 f10 f8 * sqrt ,f8 f12 f10 * sqrt ,f6 f5 f8 tanh * ,f10 f5 f8 tanh * ,f10 f9 f5 tanh * ]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Multiplicative Interactions:** Introduced new interactions such as `f5 f8 *`, `f5 f10 *`, etc., which can capture the combined effects of these features on the target variable.
2. **Additive Interactions:** Added features such as `f6 f9 +` and `f8 f10 +` to detect linear interactions between pairs of features.
3. **Sqrt Transformations:** Applied square root transformations to some features and interactions to help stabilize variance and normalize the data.
4. **Log Transformations:** Included log transformations for interactions to capture potential multiplicative effects.
5. **Complex Interaction Combinations:** Combined multiple features using addition and multiplication (`f6 f9 f8 + *`, `f10 f5 f8 tanh *`, etc.) to explore more complex relationships that might better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

These variations aim to better capture the potential relationships and dynamics within the data, potentially leading to improved predictive power in downstream tasks.

```

Explanation:
1. **Advanced Transformations**: I've introduced complex operations such as `sqrt`, `square`, `cube`, `tanh`, and combinations of trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tanh`) to capture nonlinear relationships and complex interactions among features.

2. **Feature Interactions**: Involving interactions such as subtracting and combining features with multiplication and other transformations encourages exploration of relationships between various metrics.

3. **Scaled Transformations**: Utilizing scaling techniques like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `sigmoidal_scaler` helps in normalizing features, potentially improving model performance by reducing variance and making the data more homogeneous.

4. **Reciprocal and Logarithmic Scaling**: Incorporating reciprocal and logarithmic transformations helps in handling features with large ranges and potential skewness, aiding stability and performance.

This constructed set maintains the format as requested, enriching the feature pool with more sophisticated and varied transformations for improved detection capability in the defect prediction task.

### Explanation:
1. **Combining Features**: I retained the use of addition and subtraction from the original examples to combine related features.
2. **Advanced Transformations**: Incorporated transformations like `reciprocal`, `log`, `sin`, and `tanh`, which provide nonlinear transformations that can help capture complex relationships in the data.
3. **Quantile Transformation**: Retained and utilized on `f8` to ensure distribution correction for skewed data.
4. **Feature Scaling**: Introduced a `minmax_scaler` operation to normalize feature `f9`, enhancing its interpretability and stability.
5. **Root and Square Operations**: Kept square and introduced square root operations, which are useful for variance normalization and managing skewness.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set:
- We've kept basic features as is for initial straightforward insights.
- We've applied multipliers linking flow graph complexity and Halstead metrics (`f3`, `f9`, `f10`) to improve interaction terms.
- Sqrt and reciprocal transformations are applied to key metrics (`f9`, `f11`) for normalization and complexity reduction.
- Extended reciprocal transformations further normalize values and highlight non-linear patterns.
- We've kept square and scaling transformations on certain features to reflect their quadratic nature or adjust them to a common scale.

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Arithmetic and Transformations:**
   - Subtraction (`-`) and squaring (`square`) are used to capture interactions and nonlinear relationships between features.
   - Added square root (`sqrt`) to explore the effect of transformation while maintaining numerical stability.

2. **Advanced Transformations:**
   - Quantile Transformation (`quan_trans`) and subsequent sine transformations (`sin`) are used to explore feature distributions and periodic patterns.
   - Usage of reciprocal is intended to examine inverse relationships, augmented with squaring for further exploration of nonlinear interactions.

3. **Combined Usage:**
   - Combinations of basic and advanced transformations reused across different feature constructions (including subtractions and squares) to ensure a wide spectrum of possible transformations while considering both linear and nonlinear relationships.

This approach aims to maximize the predictive power of the features by leveraging complex interactions, combined transformations, and transformations that enhance both direct linear and subtle nonlinear interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f11 tanh ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f18 cube ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f3 log ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f18 stand_scaler ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f0 f1 + ,f2 f3 *,f4 f5 -,f6 f7 /]
```

This new set includes a mix of logarithmic, square root, hyperbolic tangent, reciprocal, cube transformations, scaling, and basic arithmetic operations, all applied across various combinations of the original features. The intent of this feature engineering process is to enrich the feature space, potentially capturing non-linear patterns or interactions that could improve the predictive performance of the model.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this improved feature set, I included a few transformations from the first set, like `f5 cube` and `f6 sigmoid`, and the quantile transformation for `f9` from the second set. Additionally, I maintained a series of transformed differences and cosine transformations, which can help capture non-linear patterns and interactions between features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

Here’s a suggested feature set:

```

```

In this new feature set:

1. **Combination**: We use a combination of arithmetic operations and statistical scalars like `sqrt`, `log`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `quan_trans`.

2. **Non-linear transformations**: Introduced `sin`, `square`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `reciprocal` to capture complex patterns.

3. **Chained operations**: Chaining multiple operations (like `sqrt`, `log`, `minmax_scaler`) to derive more representative features from existing ones.

These transformations aim to provide a richer representation of the data that can capture underlying patterns associated with software defects. Always evaluate the impact of the new features on model performance using appropriate metrics.

```

In this improved set:
- We retained the transformations such as `square` and `tanh` which capture non-linear relationships in the second example.
- We introduced interaction terms such as `f0 f1 *` and `f4 f5 sqrt *`, which may capture coupling effects between different features.
- We added innovative combinations using operations like `sin`, `cos`, `reciprocal`, and `log` to capture complex interactions and potential periodicity or dampening effects.
- `cube` transformation on `f11` is used to capture higher-order effects which can significantly enhance modeling for non-linear phenomena.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:58:31,526 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the examples provided, we want to aim for transformations that capture non-linear interactions and provide standardized metrics. 

Here is a proposed better feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f5 cube, f6 sigmoid, f9 quan_trans, f7 log, f4 sqrt, f5 stand_scaler, f0 minmax_scaler, f20 tanh, f3 reciprocal log, f9 sqrt reciprocal, f18 f7 sigmoid +, f18 f4 sqrt +, f18 f0 cube +, f18 f5 stand_scaler +, f18 f1 cube tanh + f3, f18 f20 sigmoid tanh +, f18 f0 minmax_scaler tanh +]
```

**Rationale:**
- We retain several original features to keep foundational data.
- Retain `cube`, `sigmoid`, and `quan_trans` to capture non-linear interactions and data distributions.
- Use `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `tanh` to normalize or scale features, making data more interpretable for models.
- Introduce `log` transformations for skewed data.
- Use operations like `+` to combine features to potentially capture interactions or aggregate more information.
- Incorporate combinations that imply interaction between key transformed features, aiming to capture complex relationships within the data that are potentially predictive.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:58:40,313 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations, let's create an improved set of features. This set will attempt to leverage both feature scaling techniques and non-linear transformations to enhance the representation of the original data for predicting software defects.

Here's an improved feature set:

```

This feature set incorporates a mix of transformations:
- **Statistical Transformations** like standard scaling and quantile transformations are applied to standardize the distribution of key features, especially those related to Halstead and McCabe complexity measures (i.e. effort, volume, design complexity, etc.).
- **Numerical Transformations** such as square root, log, reciprocal, and cube functions add non-linear perspectives, helpful for capturing intricate relationships in the data.
- **Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Transformations** like sin and tanh are used on selected features as they can help uncover periodic pattern aspects or compress large values.

This diverse combination of feature transformations aims to create a robust feature space that may capture the complex, non-linear patterns associated with software defects more effectively.

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Inclusion**: Selected key features based on two examples provided, such as `f0`, `f1`, `f5`, `f6`, among others, maintaining a wide variety of initial features.
2. **Reciprocal Transformations**: Retained reciprocal transformations but kept it to pertinent features like `f0` and `f20`.
3. **Trigonometric Transformations**: Introduced sine transformation for features `f10` and `f11` for improved non-linear transformation capabilities. Added the `tanh` for some combinations to encapsulate another non-linear transformation.
4. **Square Transformations**: Applied square transformations on `f17` and `f18` to capture variance and potential quadratic relationships.
5. **Combining Features**: Constructed feature combinations using division (`/`) to create interaction terms and utilized logarithms for interaction compounds with potential large values.
6. **Root Transformations**: Applied a square root transformation to `f9` to handle skewness.

This new set should provide varied, non-linear, and cross-feature interactions to better capture underlying patterns that might be useful for predicting software defects.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:59:13,995 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, I'll attempt to construct an improved feature set by leveraging nonlinear transformations and interactions between features. The goal is to create features that capture more complex relationships that may be indicative of software defects.

Here's a proposed feature set inspired by the examples:

```plaintext
[f5 ,f8 ,f9 ,f17 ,f8 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f8 sqrt sin ,f7 cube ,f8 cube ,f18 cube ,f19 cube ,f8 sqrt cube ,f18 sqrt cube ,f19 sqrt cube ,f7 cube sin ,f8 cube sin ,f16 cube sin ,f18 cube sin ,f8 sqrt cube sin ,f18 sqrt cube sin ,f19 sqrt cube sin ,f12 tanh ,f9 tanh ,f18 tanh ,f8 quan_trans ,f18 quan_trans ,f7 cube sin sin ,f8 cube sin sin ,f18 cube sin sin ,f8 f9 + ,f7 sqrt sin sin ,f8 stand_scaler sin ,f8 quan_trans sin ,f10 stand_scaler ,f18 stand_scaler ,f19 stand_scaler ,f5 f8 / ,f8 f9 + sin ,f10 sin ,f18 sin ,f7 sqrt cube sin sin sin ,f8 sqrt cube sin sin sin ,f16 sqrt cube sin sin sin ,f18 sqrt cube sin sin sin ,f19 sqrt cube sin sin sin ,f8 f9 + minmax_scaler]
```

**Explanation:**
- I included a range of statistical transformations (e.g., `sqrt`, `cube`, `sin`, `tanh`) that are capable of capturing nonlinear patterns in the data.
- The interactions like `f7 sqrt sin sin`, which involve combining multiple transformations, could help in discovering relationships that are not obvious from raw features.
- Used scaling techniques (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) to normalize the data, which helps in model convergence and improves numerical stability.
- Interaction terms like `f8 f9 +` and `f5 f8 /` explore potential relationships between combinations of features.
- Incorporating `quan_trans` with nonlinear functions enriches the diversity of the feature set, addressing different types of distributions within the data.

The above feature transformations aim to enhance the model's ability to detect subtle patterns predictive of software defects.

```

### Explanation of Additions:
1. **Min-Max Scaling for f10, f11, f6**: Helps to normalize features to a common range, improving model sensitivity to feature differences.
2. **Square Root Transform for f0, f1, f2, f3**: Can stabilize variance and make data more normal distribution-like, which can be useful for some algorithms.
3. **Cubing f10**: Emphasizes larger values, potentially highlighting critical ranges in the data.
4. **Sigmoid Transform for f14**: Compresses values to be between 0 and 1, useful for probability-like interpretation in classification tasks.
5. **Tanh Transform for f15**: Similar to sigmoid but ranges from -1 to 1, maintains the sign of input data which may capture polarity.
6. **Standard Scaling for f4**: Centers data around mean zero and unit variance, making it useful for models sensitive to data scale.

These additional transformations can help in capturing complex relationships and offer better predictive power by enhancing input data distribution and scaling.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Explanation:
- Incorporated `tanh` and `sin` transformations to capture potential non-linearities in f1, f2, f7, and created interaction terms.
- Used `cube` and `quan_trans` transformations on selective features for variance stabilization and scaling.
- Combined `square` operations with other non-linear operations (`sin`, `quan_trans`, `tanh`) to get more complex interaction terms which might capture important patterns.
- These transformations and interactions are aimed at capturing complex relationships in the data that weren't evident with the original linear-combined transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:59:33,889 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples you've provided, the latter one seems slightly better as it includes some additional transformations such as `f8 stand_scaler`, `f9 cube`, and `f9 sin` that could offer more nuanced insights into the data. I'll build on that example further to create a potentially improved feature set.

Here's an enhanced feature set:

```
[f0, f7, f8, f9, f11, 
f5 cube, f6 sigmoid, f7 sigmoid, f8 stand_scaler, f9 cube, f9 sin, 
f5 cube sigmoid, f5 stand_scaler, f6 cos,

f18 f4 square cos -, 
f9 cube sin, f8 f9 * sqrt, f4 f11 / log]
```

In this feature set, I:

1. Retained the useful new transformations from the previous set (e.g., `f9 cube`, `f9 sin`).
2. Added new transformations to explore different interactions and non-linearities between features:
   - `f9 cube sin` to explore periodic behavior in combination with cubic transformation, 
   - `f8 f9 * sqrt` to explore interactions between scaled `f8` and `f9`,
   - `f4 f11 / log` to examine the ratio of `f4` and `f11` through a logarithmic transformation.

Such transformations could enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns related to software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

```

In this feature set:

- I've retained several complex interactions using `sqrt`, `cube`, and `sin` transformations, which exploit non-linear aspects in your original features that may correlate with defects.
- Incorporated transformations like `cos` and `tanh` to capture additional non-linear relationships.
- Added interactions between multiple features using operations such as `+`, `*` combined with `sqrt`, `cube`, `sin`, etc., enabling more complex combinations.
- Included a few interactions with `reciprocal` that can be useful if the inverse relationships offer new information.
- Used `stand_scaler` and `quan_trans` to normalize and try to uniform the feature distribution, potentially improving the model's learning dynamics.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:59:56,187 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, we can design a better feature set by leveraging more complex transformations while ensuring that the transformations might capture intricate relationships in the data that are pertinent to the defect prediction task:

```

```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Transformation Complexity:** We've maintained complex transformations (like cube, sin, reciprocal, etc.) from both sets to explore nonlinear relationships that might be crucial for predicting software defects.

2. **Feature Coverage:** To potentially capture different aspects of the data, we've used features from both sets and imposed various transformations on them, ensuring we touch upon both linear and non-linear spaces.

3. **Variety of Operations:** The set includes mathematical operations such as reciprocal, cube, sin, and tanh, providing a broad exploration of feature space transformations.

4. **Normalization and Scaling:** Including operations like stand_scaler, quan_trans, and tanh for normalization and value transformation helps mitigate the effects of outliers and make the learning process smoother.

5. **Comprehensive Sin Transformations:** Sin and cube transformations are used in a combinatorial fashion on multiple features to capture periodic or complex relationships within the feature data effectively.

By building a different combination of transformations and using them synergistically, we aim to discover patterns that were not evident in the original feature space or in simpler transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:00:07,399 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, we can generate a new feature set that balances complexity and diversity while leveraging transformations that may capture non-linear relationships. I'll aim to combine meaningful mathematical transformations and differences between features, focusing on avoiding excessive complexity, which might introduce noise rather than useful information.

Here's a better feature set that combines ideas from both examples and introduces transformations that may aid in capturing more complex relationships:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f5 f6 /, f3 f4 *, f7 square, f8 sqrt, f9 log, f2 tanh, f14 f0 -, f1 minmax_scaler, f10 f11 +, f12 f13 -, f18 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal, f12 f19 *, f3 f5 f6 + *, f7 f8 f9 + +, f17 f16 /]
```

- The set begins with the original features for foundational predictions.
- Added interaction terms like `f5 f6 /` and `f3 f4 *` to capture relationships between features.
- Applied diverse transformations including `sqrt`, `square`, `log`, `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, `reciprocal`, etc., to capture non-linear relationships.
- Included some simple mathematical operations between features, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, to explore interactions.
- Limited the complexity by avoiding overly nested or recursive transformations that could introduce noise.

This balanced approach will potentially enhance the predictive power by exploring both linear and non-linear interactions while maintaining interpretability.

2026-01-17 18:00:14,012 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, we want to create a better feature set by leveraging combinations of transformations that maintain or enhance predictive power. The transformations applied in the second example focus more on a quantile transformation for f9. To improve, we'll consider a combination of standard scaling, logarithmic transformations, and reciprocal transformations to potentially capture non-linearity and variance across the features:

```

```

In this set:
- `f4 log`, `f5 log`: Logarithmic transformations capture multiplicative relationships and mitigate skewness.
- `f0 stand_scaler`, `f1 stand_scaler`, `f4 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling normalizes the data, capturing outliers and spreading the input features evenly.
- `f9 minmax_scaler`, `f9 sqrt`: Min-max scaling and square root can handle skewness and normalize counts.
- `f0 reciprocal`, `f1 reciprocal`, `f20 reciprocal`: The reciprocal transformation can manage features with a large range or variance.
- `f6 sigmoid`, `f7 tanh`: These capture non-linear relationships and are often useful for multi-layer network structures.
- `f9 quan_trans`: Quantile transformation addresses distribution issues, mapping a variable to a uniform distribution.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:00:21,291 - INFO - llm output = Considering the two feature transformation examples you provided, we must strive for a balance between complexity and expressive power to enhance prediction accuracy. We aim to leverage transformations that efficiently capture the underlying patterns without introducing unnecessary computational complexity or redundancy.

Let's consider the transformations employed:

1. **Reduction of Redundancy:** Avoid overly complex recursive transformations when possible, as seen with repeated reciprocal usage.
2. **Introducing meaningful nonlinear transformations:** Utilizing functions like `tanh`, `log`, `square`, `cube`, and `sigmoid` that can capture non-linear relationships, possibly not realized by the original features.
3. **Feature Normalization:** Utilize normalization techniques like `minmax_scaler` when useful for bringing different features onto a similar scale, improving optimization performance. 

Here is a proposed better feature set transformation:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, 
f9 square, f5 cube, f11 tanh, f8 sqrt, f14 sigmoid, 
f5 cube log, 
f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, 
f6 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, 
f18 f5 cube -, f18 f0 sigmoid -, f18 f6 tanh -,
f5 cube f8 sqrt *, 
f9 square f7 log +,
f3 log f2 sqrt *, 
f0 sqrt f1 -, 
f2 cube f4 tanh *]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Combinations of Derived Features:** Such as `f5 cube f8 sqrt *` and `f3 log f2 sqrt *`, aiming to combine powerful transformations representing feature interactions that might be correlated with the target outcome.
- **Reduction of Excessive Operations:** By limiting unnecessary recursive operations and focusing on transformations adding discriminative power.
- **Structured Approach to Feature Generation:** Combining base transformations with nonlinear operations to create complex but interpretable transformations, potentially capturing intricate patterns in data.

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: Kept essential features like `f0`, `f1`, `f4`, etc., as they form the base.
- **Quantization**: Added `f9 quan_trans` and `f11 quan_trans` to capture non-linear effects in these features.
- **Reciprocal & Higher Reciprocals**: Applied reciprocal transformations and higher-order reciprocals to some features like `f0`, `f1`, `f3`, and `f20` to explore multiplicative inverses.
- **Sqrt & Sigmoid**: Used `f9 sqrt` and `f9 sigmoid reciprocal` to capture transformations that can normalize distributions.
- **Focused Diversity**: Avoided excessive depth in transformation chains to prevent numerical instability while retaining enough variety to capture complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:00:33,852 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, the second one includes a more extensive set of transformed features, which can capture more complex relationships in the data. To construct an improved feature set from the two examples, let's include high-value transformations such as `square`, `tanh` for non-linearity, and `reciprocal` transformations for various features. This time, I'll diversify the transformations to explore more potential useful transformations. Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 square ,f0 square ,f1 square ,f9 tanh ,f0 tanh ,f1 tanh ,f2 tanh ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f9 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f2 log ,f3 log ,f9 log]
```

In this proposal, I've included:

- `square` transformations on `f0`, `f1`, and `f9` to capture quadratic relationships.
- `tanh` transformations on `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f9` to account for non-linear relationships.
- `reciprocal` transformations on several features to emphasize the effect of smaller values.
- `log` transformations on `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f9` to stabilize variance and normalize skewed distributions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:00:39,743 - INFO - llm output = Given the feature transformations presented in the examples, I'll provide an improved feature set, considering the operations and new features derived from the original ones. The goal is to enhance the representation for downstream tasks like defect prediction.

Here is the refined feature set:

```

```

Explanation:

- Utilized a mix of mathematical and statistical transformations to better capture patterns and relationships found in the defect prediction context.
- Combined features like `f2` and `f9` using multiplication to gauge their combined effect, considering `f2` and `f9` have unique property representations.
- Employed `tanh` on a feature derived from multiplication to potentially improve the non-linearity captured.
- Incorporated transformations such as `log`, `sqrt`, and `minmax_scaler` for better distribution handling and normalization, potentially leading to more informative representations.
- Prioritized combinations and transformations that might help in understanding complex interactions and associations present within the raw features.

In this feature set:

1. Both `log`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `minmax_scaler` are used to capture different non-linear relations among features.
2. Stand_scaler is applied extensively for normalization.
3. Reciprocals are repetitively applied to capture potential inversely proportional relationships among certain features.
4. Squares and cubes are used to explore polynomial relationships, particularly with features known for their large ranges or values.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

The examples provided show some creativity in feature transformations, so let's build on that.

**New Feature Set:**

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

```

### Explanation:

1. **Incorporating Non-linear Functions:** Using functions like `cube`, `tanh`, `square`, and `sqrt`, which are common in feature engineering, allows for capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

2. **Reciprocal and Logarithms:** By using `reciprocal` and `log`, we can manage features with long-tail distributions or high variance, effectively normalizing or rescaling them.

3. **Interaction Terms:** Including terms like `f2 f3 log +` and `f3 f1 reciprocal * f19 +` introduces interaction effects, which can be significant in understanding combined feature impacts that might not be evident when features are considered independently.

4. **Feature Scaling:** Utilized `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to scale the features. This is crucial for algorithms sensitive to the scale of the data, like support vector machines or k-means clustering.

5. **Post-processing with Advanced Functions:** Applying multiple transformations, such as `f9 tanh f7 sqrt log +` and `f0 sqrt f13 reciprocal reciprocal *`, can help in capturing complex relationships that single transformations might miss.

This new set aims to create a rich and diverse pool of features from which a downstream algorithm can learn effectively. Balancing simplicity with complexity in the features can allow prediction models to generalize well to unseen data.

### Explanation of Transformations:

1. **Base Features**: Retain important features related to Halstead metrics (e.g., `f5`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f11`, etc.) which are likely to provide strong baselines.

2. **Non-linear Transformations**: 
   - Applied `cos`, `tanh`, and `sqrt` functions on selected features to capture non-linear patterns.
   
3. **Combinations**:
   - Added interactions between `f5` and most other features to explore their combined effects.
   - Added interactions between non-linearly transformed features (`cos` and `sqrt`) and other features to enhance the derived non-linear relationships.
   
4. **Complex Transformations**:
   - Included `cos reciprocal`, `cos tanh`, and `square` transformations, particularly where multiple interactions are compounded, to uncover complex patterns.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:01:04,997 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, it seems that the latter feature set is more comprehensive with additional transformations applied. To construct an even better feature set, we can consider adding some new transformations, combining features, and ensuring that we capture non-linear relationships more effectively. Here's a proposed improved feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 square ,f9 tanh ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f2 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f3 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal ,f0 log ,f1 log ,f2 log ,f3 log ,f4 log ,f5 log ,f6 log ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f11 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f13 sqrt ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f4 f5 + ,f3 f2 - ,f8 f9 * ,f6 f7 / ,f16 f17 + ,f18 f19 - ,f0 f11 tanh ,f20 f12 sigmoid]
```

In this enhanced feature set, I have:

1. Added logarithm transformations (`log`) to several key features to reduce skewness and highlight multiplicative relationships.
2. Applied square root (`sqrt`) and min-max scaling (`minmax_scaler`) to capture interactions and normalize data between 0 and 1.
3. Included basic arithmetic operations between some of the features (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to create new synthetic features that might capture interactions between features.
4. Included activation functions (`tanh`, `sigmoid`) applied to combinations of original features to capture non-linear relationships more explicitly.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set combines various transformations such as `sqrt`, `cube`, `sin`, `tanh`, `quan_trans`, `stand_scaler`, and operations like addition and multiplication, applied to different original features. The goal is to introduce new non-linear relationships and scale/normalize features, which might be beneficial for the prediction model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This set leverages both non-linear transformations and interactions among features to potentially capture more complex relationships that improve predictive power for software defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:01:41,406 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature set examples, let's synthesize a new feature set by incorporating transformations that deepen the representation capability, while maintaining the focus on a variety of operations:

- Retain some original features to ensure basic metrics are preserved.
- Use a mix of transformations including non-linear mappings and scaled features.
- Introduce interactions and differences between transformed features to maximize variability and dependency expressions.

Here's a refined and possibly improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9 sigmoid, f10 tanh, f11 log, f12 stand_scaler, f13 minmax_scaler, f14 square, f15 sqrt, f16 reciprocal, f17 cube, f18 quan_trans, f19 stand_scaler, f20 minmax_scaler, f5 cube, f6 sigmoid, f9 quan_trans, f18 f0 - , f18 f5 cube - , f18 f1 sqrt - , f18 f6 cos - , f18 f7 tanh - , f18 f8 reciprocal - , f18 f9 sqrt - , f18 f10 tanh - , f18 f11 log - , f18 f12 stand_scaler - , f18 f13 minmax_scaler - , f18 f14 square - , f18 f15 sqrt - , f18 f17 cube - , f18 f19 stand_scaler - , f18 f20 minmax_scaler - , f5 f6 sigmoid +, f5 f9 quan_trans +, f6 f9 quan_trans +, f18 f5 cube sigmoid cos - , f18 f7 tanh cosine +]
```

**Explanation:**
- The feature set includes a series of transformations (e.g., `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `log`, `square`, etc.) to introduce non-linear complexities.
- Differences between original and transformed features (`f18 f0 -`, `f18 f5 cube -`, etc.) are used to capture deviations in variable importance.
- Pairwise interactions such as addition (`f5 f6 sigmoid +`, `f5 f9 quan_trans +`, etc.) expand the feature space by exploring synergistic effects.
- Diverse scalers (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) ensure that the model benefits from standardized and normalized representations, which might be useful under different distribution assumptions.
- The holistic use of these operations attempts to capture complex relationships that might be predictive of software defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:01:49,331 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the two examples provided, we will focus on creating features that may capture more informative aspects and interactions among the original features while ensuring not to overly complicate the transformations. Here is a proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f5, f6, f10, f11, f12, f13, f15, f17, f18, f20, f0 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal, f10 sin, f11 sin, f17 square, f18 square, f20 reciprocal, f5 reciprocal reciprocal, f5 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f5 f0 /, f5 f1 /, f5 f6 /, f5 f10 /, f5 f12 /, f5 f0 + log, f20 f0 / sin, f5 f13 / tanh, f5 f15 / tanh, f5 f9 * f17 square, f0 f1 + minmax_scaler, f8 f19 / cube, f12 f13 / tanh, f0 f5 + sqrt]
```

Here's a breakdown of the transformations:
- Maintaining useful basic transformations like reciprocals, square, and square roots of features which may help model interpretability.
- Retained meaningful interactions from previous sets (like division, sine transformation).
- Introduced new interactions and transformations, like cube and tanh, which can capture nonlinear relationships.
- Added combinations using minmax_scaler and interaction terms potentially capturing relationships or correlations between features that were not explicitly modeled previously (e.g., adding and multiplying features before applying a transformation or a scaling operation).

These transformations should be able to capture a wider range of interactions and nonlinearities present in the original data, offering potential improvements for predictive modeling tasks.
