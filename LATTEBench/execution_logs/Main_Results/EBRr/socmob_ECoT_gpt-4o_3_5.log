```

### Explanation:
1. Basic transformations and interactions between features using subtraction (`-`), similar to the previous set.
2. Include some basic non-linear transformations such as `sqrt` and `tanh` applied to `f4`, since it might be critical given its inclusion in the prior examples.
3. The interactions from the previous feature examples are retained and enhanced by incorporating additional `tanh` transformations. This is used because `tanh` can capture non-linearity effectively.
4. A nested non-linear transformation using `tanh tanh` on one of the interactions to introduce more complexity.

The goal here is to slowly introduce more complex features by combining basic arithmetic operations and non-linear transformations, while still keeping the structure manageable and interpretable.

Explanation:
1. Included `f3 f4 +` to capture interaction between `f3` (family structure) and `f4` (counts for son's first occupation), similar to the first example.
2. Retained `f4 sigmoid f4 +` and `f4 sigmoid cos square` from the first example for their non-linear transformations which could be useful in capturing complex patterns.
3. Added `f1 f4 + stand_scaler`, a feature that standardizes interaction between `f1` (sons_occupation) and `f4`.
4. Used `f0 f4 -` to get insights about the difference in counts related to `f0` (fathers_occupation) and `f4`.
5. Incorporated `f1 f4 - stand_scaler` to examine the significance of the difference between `f1` and `f4`, with the values standardized to improve model performance.
6. Added `f3 f4 - log`, utilizing the logarithmic transformation to reduce skewness and normalize the distribution when contrasting `f3` and `f4`. 

The new feature set attempts to create a balanced repository of transformations and interactions for effective model predictions while including narrowly tailored non-linear features that could enhance predictive performance.

2026-01-19 20:36:27,314 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature engineering examples provided, the goal is to apply transformations to the features that might capture nonlinear relationships and interactions more effectively, particularly considering the transformations demonstrated (like tanh, cube, etc.). Combining these transformations can help improve the model's ability to capture complex patterns and make better predictions.

Considering your examples, here is a feature set that might be more predictive:

```
[f2 ,f4 ,f4 tanh ,f4 tanh cube ,f1 f4 tanh + ,f1 f2 tanh + ,f1 f2 f2 + tanh + ,f1 f4 tanh cube + ,f1 f4 tanh + tanh ,f1 f2 tanh + tanh ,f1 f2 f2 + tanh + tanh ,f1 f4 tanh cube + tanh]
```

Here's the reasoning for this construction:
1. You maintain similar transformations to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships.
2. Add layers of the tanh transformation and cube to explore complex interactions.
3. Experiment with interaction between features (such as `f1 f4 tanh cube +`), as interactions might hold valuable information.
4. Utilize tanh to potentially capture diminishing returns or threshold effects more effectively.

These transformed features could provide deeper insights and potentially improve prediction accuracy in your downstream tasks.

- Retained a combination of non-linear transformations like `sigmoid`, `cos`, `cube`, and `square` to enhance non-linear relationships.
- Integrated multiple scaling methods like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to standardize features, ensuring that different scales of numerical data are accounted for.
- Added combinations involving `tanh` to capture hyperbolic transformations, coupled with existing transformations.
- Maintained diversity by including both simple and complex interactions from the original sets, reinforcing valuable signal capture while exploring novel feature spaces.

Here’s one potential improved feature set:

[f4 sqrt tanh tanh sin, f4 minmax_scaler tanh sin, f4 cube, f4 cos, f1 log, f0 f2 *, f4 reciprocal tanh sin] 

Explanation:
1. **f4 sqrt tanh tanh sin**: Builds on complex transformations to potentially capture intricate patterns in `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
2. **f4 minmax_scaler tanh sin**: Normalization followed by non-linear transformations to preserve variance and amplify non-linear relationships.
3. **f4 cube**: Captures potential exponential behavior in the target variable.
4. **f4 cos**: Adds a cyclical nature which might be beneficial for periodic patterns.
5. **f1 log**: Log transformation handles skewness, and the nominal features remain unaffected.
6. **f0 f2 ***: Interaction term between features `f0` and `f2` potentially represents compounded effects of father's and son's occupation resemblance or mismatch.
7. **f4 reciprocal tanh sin**: A combination of non-linear transformations that could provide additional informative features to enhance model complexity.

Here's a proposed feature set combining these strategies:

```
[f4 minmax_scaler ,f4 tanh tanh ,f1 f4 minmax_scaler reciprocal + ,f1 f4 tanh tanh reciprocal + ,f1 f3 f4 + minmax_scaler tanh + ,f1 f3 f3 reciprocal + tanh + ,f3 f4 minmax_scaler reciprocal + ,f4 minmax_scaler f1 reciprocal + ,f1 f3 f4 + minmax_scaler cube + ,f4 minmax_scaler f3 f4 cube + ,f1 f4 tanh tanh reciprocal cube + ,f4 minmax_scaler reciprocal f4 tanh tanh +]
```

This feature set strategically uses transformations such as `minmax_scaler`, `tanh`, and `reciprocal`, hoping to optimize feature space through scaling, non-linear transformations, and reciprocal calculations which might help in handling skewness and amplifying separation between classes.

2026-01-19 20:37:20,164 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided and the context, the goal is to transform the features in a way that might improve predictions. We see that both previous examples involve arithmetic operations with the feature `f4` (counts_for_sons_first_occupation) and other features, as well as some mathematical transformations like `cube`, `cos`, and `sin`. 

To create a new and potentially better feature set, we could consider using transformations that make the data more linear or standardized. Here's a transformed feature set which combines ideas from the provided examples:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f4 stand_scaler, f4 log, f4 sigmoid, f0 f4 -, f1 f4 -, f2 f4 -]

Explanation:
1. `f4 stand_scaler`: Standardize the counts for son's occupation to reduce the effect of non-normal distribution.
2. `f4 log`: Apply logarithm transformation to potentially linearize any exponential growth patterns in the data.
3. `f4 sigmoid`: Sigmoid transformation can be useful to compress values into a smaller space between 0 and 1.
4. Subtractive operations (`f0 f4 -`, `f1 f4 -`, `f2 f4 -`) continue to highlight the relative difference in counts, which seems to be a common theme in previous examples and might capture meaningful variance. 

This set leverages normalization, transformations, and maintains the relative differences which could enhance predictive performance.

2026-01-19 20:37:44,936 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature sets, the task is to further improve the feature set by combining or transforming them to enhance predictions.

Let's analyze the operations used in both feature sets:

1. **Common Operations**: Both feature sets extensively use transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, `sin`, `sigmoid`, and scaling techniques (`minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans`).

2. **Complex Combinations**: The second feature set explores deeper combinations with operations like `tanh sin tanh`, `minmax_scaler sin sin`, and use of `sigmoid sin`.

To combine improvements and complexity, let's propose a new feature set that integrates transformations, scaling, and combinations while ensuring it potentially captures more complex relationships:

1. `[f4 sqrt tanh cube sin]`: Incorporates both magnitude transformation (`cube`) and oscillation (`sin`) on already `tanh` transformed scale.

2. `[f4 quan_trans tanh tanh cos]`: Uses quantile transformation for non-linear distribution shaping, followed by dual `tanh` to normalize and `cos` for frequency pattern identification.

3. `[f4 stand_scaler sin sigmoid +]`: Standard scaling to normalize, followed by non-linear `sin` and logistic growth interpretation with `sigmoid`, which is then summed for coherence pattern extraction.

4. `[f4 reciprocal sqrt tanh sin]`: Uses reciprocal to inverse the scale, followed by root transformation for balance, `tanh` for non-linear squashing, finished with `sin` to capture oscillatory influence.

This new feature set continues to utilize the strengths of previous transformations while focusing on capturing potentially more intricate underlying relationships and patterns in the data.

- Used `tanh` on `f2 f4` to potentially capture non-linear relationships between these two features.
- Introduced division with `f3 f4 /` to look at the proportion between `f3` and `f4`, which could represent relative importance.
- Applied `log` transformation to `f2` to reduce skewness and highlight multiplicative relationships.
- Implemented `sigmoid` on `f3` to utilize logistic transformation's curve to dampen extreme values.
- Added `minmax_scaler` on `f2` to normalize values which might aid algorithms that benefit from data scaling.
- Used reciprocal of `f3` to generate the inverse which sometimes gives predictive insights.
- Combined `f2 f3 *` for creating interaction features which can capture joint effects that might not be obvious when features are considered independently.

We will aim to create a new feature set that captures useful interactions while appropriately scaling and transforming the data. Here's a proposal for a better feature set:

Feature Set:

1. `f4 f4 + f0 f3 + + f2 f1 f4 + * + minmax_scaler tanh`
2. `f4 square f3 f0 + + f1 f2 * + stand_scaler sigmoid`

6. `f4 reciprocal f3 f1 + + minmax_scaler f4 tanh +`
7. `f0 f4 + f1 f4 + + f2 f4 * minmax_scaler`

Explanation:

- The transformations such as `square`, `cube`, `log`, and `reciprocal` are included to capture non-linear relationships and interactions among features.
- `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are applied to ensure standardization and normalization, which can be vital for effectively training models.
- Functions like `sigmoid` and `tanh` offer non-linear squashing, which helps in adjusting scale and treating outliers.
- The use of postfix notation reflects interactions and transformations in a computationally structured way, enhancing the expressiveness of the feature set.

By escalating the interaction among features and applying effective transformations, this feature set aims to capture the complex dynamics of the dataset which would help in better predicting the two-class target nominal feature.

2026-01-19 20:38:29,645 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, let's derive a new feature set that incorporates the beneficial aspects of both examples while aiming for improved predictions:

1. The first example utilizes subtraction operations with `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` (f4) and applies various trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. It also combines these to create interaction terms using multiplication.
2. The second example leverages addition operations and creates transformation terms using the `tanh` and power functions such as `cube`.

To create a new and improved feature set, we can blend these ideas to capture various interactions, transformations, and non-linear effects:

[f2 ,f4 ,f4 tanh ,f4 sqrt ,f4 tanh cube ,f1 f4 tanh + ,f1 f2 tanh + ,f1 f4 tanh cube + ,f1 f4 sqrt + ,f1 f4 sqrt cube + ,f1 f2 f2 + tanh + ,f1 f4 tanh cube + tanh ,f1 f2 tanh + tanh ,f1 f4 sqrt cube + tanh]

Explanation:
- Utilize both basic transformations (`tanh`, `sqrt`) and power functions (`cube`) on `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` (f4) to explore non-linear relationships.
- Incorporate the addition of features (such as `f1` and `f2` with transformed `f4`) to explicitly model feature interactions.
- Combine transformations with addition (`+`) and power functions, especially focusing on interactions between transformed features for enhanced modeling capability.
- The feature set is designed to capture complex interactions and transformations that may enhance predictive performance in the context of this task.

- `f1 f4 cube sqrt f2 sqrt +` adds complexity by combining sqrt transformations with interactions.
- `f4 cube f0 f3 * /` demonstrates a complex interaction term useful in capturing nuanced relationships. 

These transformations can help in framing complex, non-linear patterns hidden within the data that are otherwise hard to capture with linear models.

It includes sinusoidal transformations (`sin`), aiming possibly to capture cyclic patterns that may be present in categorical data transformed into numerical space.

For a better feature set that might combine and expand on these ideas, we can consider:

- Maintain core features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`).
- Use both the differences with `f4` and sinusoidal transformations to capture both linear/non-linear interactions and potential cyclic patterns.
- Introduce additional mathematical transformations such as `sqrt`, `cube`, and `tanh` to capture non-linear relationships.

Here is the improved feature set:

```

2026-01-19 20:39:26,694 - INFO - llm output = Improving feature sets for predictive modeling involves combining and transforming existing features to better capture patterns in the data. Your task involves generating a feature set using postfix expressions, and you've provided two examples, indicating a preference for the latter being better. 

To create a single feature set that hopefully improves upon the examples you've provided, we'll employ operations that can help differentiate and enhance feature values. We'll focus on transformations that can amplify contrasts between classes, especially given the transformation of the target into a binary classification problem based on a threshold.

Here is an attempt at generating one better feature set based on your examples:

``` 
[f4 f4 + f3 f0 + + f2 f1 * + sqrt minmax_scaler, f4 f2 * f0 + minmax_scaler cube, f1 f3 + f4 + stand_scaler tanh]
```

### Explanation of the generated feature set:

1. **`f4 f4 + f3 f0 + + f2 f1 * + sqrt minmax_scaler`**: 
   - This combines several features with addition and multiplication.
   - Applies `sqrt` to handle skewed distribution effects, followed by `minmax_scaler` to normalize the values to a smaller range.

2. **`f4 f2 * f0 + minmax_scaler cube`**:
   - A multiplication operation for potential interaction between `f4` and `f2`.
   - Adds `f0` and then cubes the result post `minmax_scaler`, emphasizing differences between classes by amplifying higher values.

3. **`f1 f3 + f4 + stand_scaler tanh`**:
   - Focus on addition of multiple features and scale them using `stand_scaler`.
   - Apply `tanh` to control outlier effects and reduce extreme values, maintaining smooth gradients for learning.

These transformations are designed to enhance predictive possibilities by combining features in a way that reveals new interactions and patterns, which might be more informative than individual or raw features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this new feature set, additional operations such as `cube`, `cos`, and `sigmoid` applied in different combinations and sequentially on transformed features aim to potentially enhance the pattern distinction between classes. Using operations like `reciprocal` and combinations involving multiple basic features provides a novel representation that might capture intricate relationships within the data.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor, Craftsmen-Other, Craftsman-Construction, Salesman-Retail, Manager, Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Farm_Laborer]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Craftsmen-Other, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Service_Worker, Craftsman-Construction, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Professional-Salaried, Proprietor, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Operative-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Clerk, Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Farm_Laborer]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 427.4], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 11.9, Mean = 16.1128, Std = 38.9794

1. `f4 f4 + f3 f0 + + f2 f1 * + sqrt stand_scaler`: Combines several features through addition and multiplication, applies square root, and then standardizes.

2. `f1 f4 - f3 tanh minmax_scaler`: Computes the difference between `f1` and `f4`, applies the hyperbolic tangent function to `f3`, and performs Min-Max scaling.

3. `f0 f2 cube log`: Multiplies `f0` and the cube of `f2`, and then applies a logarithm transformation.

4. `f0 f3 * f1 f4 * +`: Multiplies `f0` with `f3`, multiplies `f1` with `f4`, and then sums the results.

5. `f2 f2 * f1 + sqrt reciprocal`: Squares `f2`, adds `f1`, applies square root, and then takes the reciprocal.

6. `f4 stand_scaler f3 sqrt /`: Standardizes `f4`, computes the square root of `f3`, and then divides the standardized `f4` by the result.
