you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Usage of Tanh**: This function can help in capturing variations across extremes and is particularly useful with features that have outliers or a large range, which could be the case with variables like `f7`, `f8`, and `f19`.
2. **Reciprocal Transformation**: Applied to `f6` because it can effectively handle skewness and reduce the impact of large values.
3. **Sigmoid Transformation**: Applied to `f5` to compress the range within [0,1], which can help enhance non-linear relationships for some features.

We'll use a mix of operations to ensure diversity and leverage combinations that might capture underlying patterns effectively.

Here's a new feature set example:

```

```

In this new feature set, I've mixed operations like multiplication (`*`), addition (`+`), and scaling transformations with trigonometric (`cos`, `sin`), hyperbolic (`tanh`), and statistical operations (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quant_trans`) to ensure a diverse capture of the features' behavior. Additionally, reciprocal transformations and more intricate combinations with cube and tanh functions were used to reflect non-linear relationships potentially present in the data.

The new feature set will use a variety of transformations and aggregations to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f17, f19, f20, f5 f9 * , f8 f11 * , f1 f6 + , f4 f10 + , f5 sqrt , f7 log , f8 log , f9 cos , f10 tanh, f0 quan_trans , f2 quan_trans , f8 quan_trans , f3 log, f7 log quan_trans , f1 tanh stand_scaler, f11 f5 * tanh, f7 sqrt stand_scaler, f8 sqrt stand_scaler, f9 sqrt stand_scaler, f4 sin quan_trans , f10 sigmoid, f11 cos, f0 sqrt stand_scaler, f11 f5 * stand_scaler, f5 f5 +, f11 stand_scaler, f19 minmax_scaler, f20 tanh sqrt, f6 f10 * quan_trans]
```

This feature set leverages a combination of transformations and interactions to capture complex patterns in the data:

- **Multiplication and Addition Interactions:** Terms like `f5 f9 *` and `f1 f6 +` capture interactions between different features, which might be meaningful for defect prediction.
  
- **Non-linear Transformations:** Functions such as `sqrt`, `log`, `cos`, `sin`, and `tanh` are used to model non-linearities in data, potentially aiding in capturing complex relationships.

- **Scaling:** Techniques like `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler` normalize features to bring them into comparable ranges, potentially improving model performance.

- **Sequential Transformations:** Operations like combination of `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `stand_scaler` used in sequence on the same feature can highlight and capture distinct aspects of the feature’s distribution. 

By combining operations, interactions, and scales, the resulting feature set aims to offer a rich set of relevant feature representations for improved defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:46:04,757 - INFO - llm output = Sure, let's create a new feature set based on the examples provided.

In the first example, we observe heavy use of transformations such as `quan_trans`, `cos`, `cube`, and combinations of transformations. The second example has more combined interaction terms formed by multiplication, and transformation through operations like `cos` and `minmax_scaler`.

To improve predictions further, we can focus on creating features that capture non-linear interactions and distributions. Here's a proposed better feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 f1 + ,f4 f5 + ,f6 f7 + ,f9 f10 + ,f11 f14 + ,f0 cube ,f1 cube ,f4 reciprocal ,f5 reciprocal ,f6 log ,f7 log ,f9 log ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f20 cos ,f5 f6 * tanh ,f1 f9 * sigmoid ,f0 f4 * stand_scaler ,f8 log reciprocal ,f9 tanh reciprocal ,f7 f10 / quan_trans ,f6 f11 / quan_trans ,f0 f18 * log ,f19 f15 * log ,f3 f17 * log ,f3 f12 * cos ,f2 f14 * reciprocal cos ,f8 f10 * tanh cos ,f7 f10 * tanh log ,f5 f15 * log tanh ,f7 f16 * cos stand_scaler ,f4 f19 * + f3 f17 * + ,f3 f14 * reciprocal tanh ,f15 f11 * cube stand_scaler ,f18 f16 * log tanh ,f12 f19 * * f2 cube]
```

This proposed feature set aims to capture various interactions and non-linear properties of the original features through operations like addition, multiplication, transformation, and combinations in different forms.

2026-01-17 17:46:08,831 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! To generate a better feature set inspired by the previous examples while considering further enhancement, we can employ various transformations. Here's the new feature set with transformations applied:

```plaintext

```

Here are some considerations for the transformations applied:

1. **General Selection**: Begin with a selection of original features that show promise based on the problem domain.
2. **Transformation Diversity**: Use a mix of transformations, such as `quan_trans`, which uniformly scales features, and `minmax_scaler` to normalize them. These transformations help balance the scale across features, enabling better model insights.
3. **Non-linear Enhancements**: Incorporate non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `cos`, and `sqrt` to capture potential complex data patterns and relationships.
4. **Feature Interaction and Advanced Scaling**: Employing advanced scaling with cube transformation on `f10` can capture higher-order interactions, which might be beneficial for complex relationships.

These steps are designed to expand on the previous feature sets, highlighting non-linear relationships and optimized scaling to potentially enhance predictive models' efficacy.

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Basic Features**: Retain all original features (f0 to f20) to ensure essential information is not lost.
2. **Enhanced Interaction Features**:
   - **Multiplication and Division**: Introduce pairwise interactions such as f0*f1, f4/f9, and f6*f7 to capture combined effects.
   - **Addition**: Use f3+f4 to explore aggregated effects.
   - **Non-linear Transformations**: Applied on selected features using operations like tanh, reciprocal, square, and cosine to capture non-linear patterns.
   - **Scaling/Standardization**: Min-max scaling on f6*f9 to ensure feature values are within a useful range for learning algorithms.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

Explanation:

1. **Transformation Variety**: The use of a variety of transformations, including trigonometric, logarithmic, reciprocal, and scaling (stand and minmax), ensures diverse exploration of feature space.
  
2. **Previous Success**: Based on observed transformations in the prior examples, combinations of basic algebraic operations (+, -, *, /) followed by complex transformations tend to capture the underlying patterns better.

3. **Higher-Order Operations**: Introducing higher-order operations (cube, tanh) can capture non-linear relationships, which are often crucial for defect prediction.

4. **Mix of Simple and Complex**: Providing a balance of simple transformations (sqrt, sin) and more complex sequences (cos reciprocal minmax_scaler) ensures robustness and versatility of the new feature set across various data scenarios.
  
Overall, this feature set should offer improved predictive capabilities by expanding the dimension and capturing potential non-linear relationships inherent in the original features.

Key considerations for this feature set:
1. **Diversity**: The set includes multiple unique features with different transformation combinations to capture varied aspects of the data.
2. **Non-linearity**: Utilization of trigonometric and non-linear functions like `sin`, `cos`, and `cube` adds non-linear transformations, potentially capturing complex relationships.
3. **Transformation Balance**: The set balances simple features (raw features and basic transformations) with more complex expressions, ensuring a blend that promotes learning.
4. **Cross-feature Interaction**: The last few features encourage interactions between different original features, which may uncover more intricate relationships within the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:46:38,735 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by combining insights from both provided examples, I'll choose and generate features that maximize transformation diversity and potential predictive power. I will ensure that we're not using original feature names and that all expressions follow the provided postfix notation format. Here's an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f17, f19, f20, f5 f9 *, f8 f11 *, f4 sin, f1 f6 +, f5 sqrt, f6 log, f8 log, f9 cos, f4 quan_trans, f7 tanh, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 tanh, f3 log quan_trans, f9 sqrt stand_scaler, f8 sqrt, f10 sigmoid, f7 f5 * stand_scaler, f19 tanh, f20 log stand_scaler, f11 f5 * cos, f6 f10 * quan_trans, f5 cos, f9 cos quan_trans, f11 cos quan_trans, f4 sin quan_trans, f0 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans]
```

Here, key transformations like `log`, `sqrt`, `cos`, `tanh` and combinations like `log quan_trans`, `stand_scaler`, etc., have been included to potentially enhance feature variability and capture non-linear relationships. Furthermore, the selection attempts to balance between simple transformations and more complex compound transformations (e.g., `f3 log quan_trans`) from both examples.

In this feature set, combinations and transformations are applied to capture interactions between relevant features, applying cosine, quantile transformation, and standard scaling techniques strategically across different features to enhance predictive power while maintaining robustness. Additionally, relevant interactions between features are captured using multiplication operations followed by transformations to better model complex relationships that may exist in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

While maintaining useful features from the previous examples, new combinations and transformations were introduced to enhance potential predictive power.

2026-01-17 17:47:10,394 - INFO - llm output = To create a new and improved feature set, I will draw from the operations and transformations applied in the two provided examples. The provided transformations include a mix of basic arithmetic operations and more advanced transformations such as trigonometric functions, scaling, quantile transformation, and others.

Here's a more refined feature set that leverages the stronger aspects of both examples:

```
[f0, f1, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f16, f17, f19, 
 f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans,

 f6 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, 
 f10 log, f20 log, 
 f5 minmax_scaler tanh, 
 f9 cos minmax_scaler, 
 f5 sigmoid]
```

**Justifications:**
- **Feature Selection:** I've chosen a mix of original features from both example sets while ensuring a balance between Halstead and McCabe metrics. This selection attempts to retain important features relevant to both complexity and program size.
- **Transformations:** I've retained and expanded on the quantile transformations and sinusoidal transformations, as those help to capture non-linear relationships and distribute data more normally.
- **Feature Interactions:** Interacting features such as `f0 f9 * sin` can often reveal more nuance in the relationships and interactions between features.
- **Standard and Min-Max Scaling:** I've included stand_scaler and minmax_scaler transformations to handle features with a large range of values.
- **Mathematical Functions:** Additions of log, reciprocal, and cube transformations are aimed at capturing changes in scale and non-linearities within the data.
- **Tanh and Sigmoid:** These non-linear transformations can be useful for capturing subtleties within feature distributions.

By synthesizing transformations, interactions, and scaling from both examples, this new feature set aims to better capture the complexities present in software defect prediction.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

In this newly constructed feature set:

- I combined various transformations (e.g., `quan_trans`, `minmax_scaler`, `cos`, `sqrt`, etc.) on different features to introduce non-linearities and capture complex relationships in the data.
- I utilized operations like `*` and `/` to create interaction terms between important features.
- Advanced functions such as `tanh` and `sigmoid` are used to add non-linearity, which is useful for modeling complex patterns often found in defect prediction tasks.
- By applying several transformations, we aim for features to better align with potential hidden patterns rather than original features alone.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f10 f19 +, f0 f6 * minmax_scaler, f4 f6 / log, f7 f8 * sigmoid, f11 f17 - reciprocal, f9 cos sqrt, f11 f19 / stand_scaler, f11 tanh, f20 cube quan_trans, f9 sin minmax_scaler]

2026-01-17 17:47:23,554 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, I will generate a new and improved feature set for defect prediction using a combination of transformations and feature generation techniques. The goal is to enhance predictive power by creating nonlinear and potentially more informative transformations of the original features.

Here's a better feature set example:

```
[f10 f19 + tanh, f0 f6 * minmax_scaler log, f4 f6 / sqrt reciprocal, f7 f8 * sigmoid cube, f11 f17 - stand_scaler, f9 cos sqrt minmax_scaler, f11 f19 / tanh log, f11 tanh quan_trans, f20 cube sin minmax_scaler, f9 sin stand_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nonlinear Transformations**: Applied nonlinear transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `reciprocal` to add nonlinearity and capture complex relationships.

2. **Scale Transformations**: Used scaling transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to ensure features are within a range suitable for machine learning models.

3. **Composite Transformations**: Combined multiple operations such as `*`, `+`, and `/` with different transformations to create more complex interactions and potentially uncover hidden patterns in the data.

4. **Postfix Expression Order**: Maintained the format of the postfix expression for consistency and ease of parsing in machine learning pipelines.

This feature set aims to provide a more comprehensive view of the data's structure, potentially revealing more nuanced patterns associated with software defects.

2026-01-17 17:47:33,844 - INFO - llm output = Based on the features given in the two examples, we can enhance the feature set by integrating transformations and combinations to capture complex patterns that might improve the predictive performance:

1. **Feature Selection**: Maintain vital features that intrinsically contribute to the software defect prediction task: f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f17, f19, f20.

2. **Feature Interactions**: Create interaction terms that might capture latent dependencies:
   - f0 f1 +: Sum of f0 and f1, possibly capturing the joint effect of two elementary code features.
   - f7 f5 *: Interaction between f7 (Halstead difficulty) and f5, followed by a standard scaler.

3. **Transformation Enhancements**: Imply complex transformations to capture non-linear relationships:
   - f5 sqrt sqrt: Double square root of f5 to smooth nonlinearities.
   - f8 log cube: Logarithmic transformation followed by a cubic transformation for f8.
   - f4 sin log: Application of sinusoidal transformation followed by logarithm to capture periodic patterns.
   - f9 cos minmax_scaler: Min-max scaling combined with cosine transformation to normalize cyclic patterns.
   
4. **Scaling and Normalization**: Standardize and normalize to ensure all features contribute uniformly during model training:
   - f1 minmax_scaler: Min-max scaler applied to f1 for normalization.
   - f9 sqrt stand_scaler: Square root transformation coupled with standard scaling.
   - f20 log stand_scaler: Log transformation followed by standard scaling for ensuring interpretability and dealing with skewness.

By integrating these considerations into a new feature set:
```
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f17, f19, f20, f0 f1 +, f5 sqrt sqrt, f8 log cube, f4 sin log, f9 cos minmax_scaler, f7 f5 * stand_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f9 sqrt stand_scaler, f20 log stand_scaler]
```

This set embodies essential raw features along with derived features through sophisticated transformations and interactions, aiding the downstream defect prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f17, f19, f20, f5 f9 *, f8 f11 *, f4 sin, f1 f6 +, f5 sqrt, f6 log, f8 log, f9 cos, f4 quan_trans, f7 tanh, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 tanh, f3 log quan_trans, f9 sqrt stand_scaler, f8 sqrt, f10 sigmoid, f7 f5 * stand_scaler, f19 tanh, f20 log stand_scaler, f11 f5 * cos, f6 f10 * quan_trans, f5 cos, f9 cos quan_trans, f11 cos quan_trans, f4 sin quan_trans, f0 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f6 reciprocal, f2 cube minmax_scaler, f9 tanh log, f5 f3 - cos, f11 f1 / tanh, f17 + f19 sigmoid, f10 tanh cube, f8 f11 + sqrt quan_trans, f12 tanh log]

2026-01-17 17:47:47,524 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, I'll aim to create a new feature set by utilizing the transformations given. The goal is to create a better set, following the indication that the second set is better than the first.

Here's a new feature set combining transformations from the two examples you've provided:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 cos, f5 f9 *, f6 log, f8 log, f3 log, f1 minmax_scaler, f7 tanh, f20 log stand_scaler, f4 sin, f5 sqrt, f11 f5 * cos, f0 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f5 cos]
```

In this new feature set:
- I retained the original features from the second set.
- I included transformations that could introduce valuable non-linear relationships and normalize certain features which could improve model performance.
- I maintained some complex interactions from the first set, which might capture interactions between the features.
- This combination introduces new operations and retains advantageous operations from the second set.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:47:59,870 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and transformations, the goal is to generate an improved set of features that might better capture the underlying structure of the data related to software defects. Here is a newly proposed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f4, f6, f7, f9, f10, f11, f16, f20, f0 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler, f18 stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler, f20 stand_scaler, f4 log, f6 log, f7 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f0 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f0 f1 *, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f18 tanh, f20 tanh, f4 log stand_scaler, f10 cube, f11 reciprocal, f8 sigmoid, f7 f10 *, f9 cos stand_scaler stand_scaler]
```

Key Enhancements:
- Added `stand_scaler` transformation to normalize features using standard scaling, which might be more suitable than quantile transformation for some distributions.
- Introduced `log`, `sqrt`, and `reciprocal` transformations on selected features to handle skewness and improve interpretability for certain metrics.
- Employed `tanh` and `sigmoid` transformations to bound features within certain ranges, potentially stabilizing model learning.
- Combined transformations in various ways (`log stand_scaler`, `cos stand_scaler stand_scaler`) to explore interactions and complex relationships.
- Incorporated additional interactions and nonlinear transformations to provide diverse views of the data structure.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:48:10,739 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions further based on the given feature sets, we can create a new feature set by combining and transforming the most informative and varied features from both sets, applying a more sophisticated combination of transformations. This will enhance the non-linear relationships capture and normalize or scale them appropriately.

Here's an improved feature set using transformations and operations:

```

Explanation:
- We kept influential transformations from both sets (like `quan_trans`, `cos`, `tanh`, `cube`) and included scale transformations (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) to normalize the data, which can enhance model performance.
- We introduced composite transformations like `sqrt minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans log`, etc., to capture complex relationships.
- We retained significant features across both sets (e.g., `f0`, `f1`, `f4`, `f7`, `f11`, etc.) and extended them with various transformations to potentially improve prediction quality.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:48:25,685 - INFO - llm output = To create a new improved feature set based on the given examples, we should focus on the operations that show a pattern of better feature extraction as seen in the latter feature set. We'll include diverse transformations, such as `quan_trans`, trigonometric transformations, and scaling operations, which help capture non-linear relationships and standardize the feature scales. Here's a constructed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, 
 f5 f9 * quan_trans, f8 f11 * quan_trans, f1 f6 + sin, f4 f10 + cos, f5 sqrt stand_scaler, 
 f7 log minmax_scaler, f8 log tanh, f9 cos quan_trans, f10 tanh sigmoid, f0 quan_trans sqrt, 
 f2 quan_trans sqrt, f8 quan_trans sqrt, f3 log sqrt, f7 log quan_trans, f1 tanh stand_scaler, 
 f11 f5 * tanh stand_scaler, f7 sqrt stand_scaler log, f8 sqrt stand_scaler log, 
 f9 sqrt stand_scaler log, f4 sin quan_trans minmax_scaler, f10 sigmoid quan_trans, f11 cos stand_scaler, 
 f0 sqrt stand_scaler tanh, f11 f5 * stand_scaler log, f5 f5 + minmax_scaler, f11 stand_scaler tanh, 
 f19 minmax_scaler quan_trans, f20 tanh sqrt cos, f6 f10 * quan_trans sqrt]
```

In this feature set, we:

- Combined multiplication and `quan_trans` for interaction terms (e.g., `f5 f9 * quan_trans`).
- Utilized trigonometric transformations followed by `quan_trans` or scaling to stabilize variance and capture complex relationships.
- Applied `sqrt`, `log`, `stand_scaler`, and `minmax_scaler` to normalize and transform features further.
- Leveraged combinations of operations to explore potentially rich interactions and non-linear relationships (e.g., `f11 f5 * tanh stand_scaler`, `f0 sqrt stand_scaler tanh`).

This approach is designed to enable better model learning by producing features that highlight important patterns and scaling appropriately for numeric features.

2026-01-17 17:48:35,828 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, the second feature set transforms a wider variety of original features using quantile transformation more extensively, which could improve the distributional properties better suited for many models. Both sets also employ some non-linear transformations such as `cos` and `sin`, with the second set including an additional transformation (`f4 sin`), potentially enhancing its expressiveness. 

To create an improved feature set based on these examples, I'll combine elements from both sets, incorporating a broad range of transformed features while adding new potentially useful transformations:

``` 
[f0, f1, f4, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f16, f20, f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f12 quan_trans, f18 quan_trans, f19 quan_trans, f20 quan_trans, f0 quan_trans quan_trans, f4 quan_trans quan_trans, f6 quan_trans quan_trans, f7 quan_trans quan_trans, f8 quan_trans quan_trans, f10 quan_trans quan_trans, f12 quan_trans quan_trans, f14 quan_trans quan_trans, f16 quan_trans quan_trans, f17 quan_trans quan_trans, f9 cos quan_trans, f9 cos quan_trans quan_trans, f4 sin, f14 sin, f0 log, f8 log, f8 cube, f4 tanh]
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Log Transformation**: Applied to `f0` and `f8`, it can help in normalizing skewed distributions.
2. **Cube Transformation**: Applied to `f8`, it may add non-linearity and capture interactions that help in predictive performance.
3. **Tanh Transformation**: Applied as an additional non-linear transformation to capture more variability in feature `f4` which was also used in `sin` transformation.

These changes are intended to increase the expressiveness of the feature set while maintaining completeness and including features that have transformations known to be beneficial in statistical modeling contexts.

### Explanation:
- **Retained useful transformations**: Kept transformations like `quan_trans`, `cos`, `cube`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `log`, and `sqrt` which have shown effectiveness in capturing underlying patterns.
- **Included higher-order transformations**: Added additional transformations including `sqrt cube` for `f9` and `quan_trans log` for `f4` which can help capture nonlinear relationships more effectively.
- **Balanced complex transformations**: While complex transformations like `quan_trans minmax_scaler` and `sigmoid minmax_scaler` remain, the introduction of straightforward transformations provides a balance between complexity and simplicity.

2026-01-17 17:48:50,580 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, I will create a new feature set aimed at improving the predictive power for the software defect prediction task. We will leverage transformations that have shown potential in simplifying or emphasizing relationships between features and defects. Here's the new feature set:

[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f17, f19, f20, f5 f9 *, f8 f11 *, f4 sin, f1 f6 +, f5 sqrt, f6 log, f9 cos, f4 quan_trans, f7 tanh, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 tanh, f3 log quan_trans, f9 sqrt stand_scaler, f8 sqrt, f10 sigmoid, f7 f5 * stand_scaler, f19 tanh, f20 log stand_scaler, f11 f5 * cos, f6 f10 * quan_trans, f5 cos, f9 cos quan_trans, f11 cos quan_trans, f4 sin quan_trans, f0 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f3 f11 * log, f19 f10 + stand_scaler, f9 f8 * sqrt, f7 f4 / stand_scaler, f5 f20 * quan_trans] 

Explanation of improvements:
- Added more composite operations like `f3 f11 * log` and `f9 f8 * sqrt` to capture multiplicative relationships and highlight potentially non-linear interactions.
- Applied `stand_scaler` to new expressions such as `f19 f10 + stand_scaler` and `f7 f4 / stand_scaler` to ensure consistency and reduce variance, which could improve the stability of the predictive model.
- Utilized `quan_trans` on a composite feature `f5 f20 *` to potentially enhance its ability to distinguish between distribution-specific characteristics. 

These transformations aim to emphasize patterns within the data that could be more predictive of defects while maintaining computational tractability.

In this feature set:

- **Quan_trans** is applied early, providing non-linear transformations.
- **Minmax_scaler** and **cube**, along with **sqrt**, provide a mix of scaling and polynomial features.
- **Tanh** and **cos** functions introduce some non-linearity which might be able to capture different defect patterns.
- Combining **reciprocal** with **sin** & **stand_scaler** can help normalize and oscillate the data, capturing periodic patterns or variabilities.

The interaction terms are designed to ensure diversity such that the model can leverage them to spot potential defects more effectively.

**Explanation of Added Transformations:**

1. **f0 sqrt tanh**: Applying a square root followed by hyperbolic tangent helps in capturing nonlinear relationships.
   
2. **f6 reciprocal**: The reciprocal of f6 could highlight potential inverse relationships, possibly offering new insights.

3. **f7 square log**: Squaring followed by logarithmic transformation can be useful to stabilize variance and result in more pronounced feature distributions.
   
4. **f9 cos minmax_scaler**: Applying cosine transformation followed by min-max scaling helps in normalizing the cyclical nature of the data while ensuring all features maintain comparable scales.

5. **f1 reciprocal cube**: This combination can capture low-level inverse relationships with elevated effects through cubing.

6. **(f4 * f6)**: Multiplying features could identify interactions and correlation between these two original features.

7. **(f1 + f9)**: Summation helps in capturing additive interactions and might enhance signal combinations between these features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation and Improvements:

1. **Base Features**: Include a comprehensive mix of original features to capture the necessary base information.
   
2. **Mathematical Transformations**: 
   - Use mathematical transformations (e.g., `sqrt`, `log`, `cube`, `sin`) to normalize or adjust skewness in data.
   - Apply `sqrt` and `cube` to different variables to potentially capture specific nonlinear relationships.

3. **Feature Interactions**: 
   - Incorporate interactions (e.g., `f0 f1 +`, `f7 f5 * stand_scaler`) to capture relationships between features.
   - Introduce a new interaction with `f5 f9 * sqrt`, aiming to capture complex interactions.

4. **Scaling and Transformation**:
   - Apply scaling techniques (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) to ensure feature comparability.
   - Transform features with `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and other operations to handle distributions and magnitudes effectively.

5. **Expanded Calculations**:
   - Combine values in ways that are unexplored in prior sets, like `f6 f8 * log`, which might capture specific patterns relevant to defects. 
   - Additionally, features like `f18 reciprocal log` may capture unique behavior in the data by transforming and scaling simultaneously.

These amendments are aimed at enhancing the predictability by leveraging more complex transformations and interactions beyond the original sets while keeping the format consistent.

Such interactions are further transformed using statistical operations like `stand_scaler` and `quan_trans` to maintain distribution's properties or adjust for non-linearity.
  
- **Trigonometric and Logarithmic Transformations:** These are included (e.g., `tanh cos`, `log sigmoid`) because they might help capture non-linear relationships present in complex datasets, providing predictive strength.

- **Statistical Scaling and Transformation:** By employing scaling techniques (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`), we mitigate issues related to disparate feature scales, which can hinder the learning algorithms, especially distance-based models.

- **Root and Reciprocal Transformations:** Employed for features where we might want to adjust skewness or linearity in the data (`sqrt`, `reciprocal`).

Remember, the choice of transformations largely depends on exploratory data analysis outcomes, understanding domain-specific insights, and ongoing evaluation against model performance metrics.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:49:28,093 - INFO - llm output = The second set focuses heavily on using quantile transformation, which is a powerful non-linear transformation useful for making variables more Gaussian-like, ensuring robust results for certain machine learning models. However, there might be an overload of transformations, which could lead to overfitting if not cross-validated properly. A more balanced feature set could combine strategic transformations and selection of original and minimally transformed features.

Here's a more balanced feature set based on the two examples provided:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f4, f6, f9, f10, f20, f0 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f20 quan_trans, f0 quan_trans quan_trans, f4 quan_trans quan_trans, f8 quan_trans quan_trans, f10 quan_trans quan_trans, f18 quan_trans quan_trans, f9 cos, f9 cos quan_trans, f4 sin, f10 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans]
```

In this set, I've ensured a mix of original features, some crucial initial quantile transformations, and deeper yet strategic quantile transformations. This should provide a robust yet less overwhelmingly transformed feature set.

2026-01-17 17:49:34,819 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, the goal is to create a new feature set that leverages advanced feature transformations to enhance predictive power for the software defect prediction task. Here's a new feature set that improves upon the previous examples:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f4, f6, f7, f9, f10, f11, f16, f19, 
 f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f11 quan_trans, f18 quan_trans, f19 quan_trans,

```

### Key Modifications:
1. **Feature Selection**: Focused on features that encapsulate line count, complexity, and operators, which are crucial for defect prediction.
2. **Transformation Depth**: Utilized quantile transformation deeply on critical features (f0, f4, f6, f7, f11, and f19) for better normalization and variance reduction.
3. **New Transformations**: Introduced transformations such as `sqrt`, `cos`, and `reciprocal` which haven’t been deeply utilized, aiming to capture unique patterns.
4. **Cube Transformation**: Applied to f10 to emphasize larger discrepancies, which may highlight crucial differences in defect-related data.
5. **Combination of Transformations**: Combined transformations like `cos` and `sqrt`, and `quan_trans` with `reciprocal` to explore non-linear relationships.

These enhancements aim to provide a richer and more nuanced feature space for the downstream prediction task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:49:40,198 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, the latter set utilizes more advanced transformation techniques such as quantile transformation and repeated transformation (i.e., applying a transformation multiple times), which can help in normalizing non-linear relationships and addressing skewness in the data. It also includes more diverse and layered transformations compared to the former.

Here is a better feature set inspired by the latter example while keeping the same format:

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 cos ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f0 quan_trans ,f1 quan_trans ,f4 quan_trans ,f6 quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans ,f18 quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans ,f20 quan_trans ,f10 sqrt ,f5 log ,f9 tanh ,f8 tanh sqrt ,f11 log sqrt ,f0 reciprocal sqrt ,f19 reciprocal quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans quan_trans]
```

This improved set includes a mix of original features and advanced transformations. It incorporates concepts of normalization, reduction of non-linearities, and stabilization of variance, which are aimed to potentially improve the predictive power of the model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Retain Basic Features**: Like the previous examples, keep basic features such as `f0, f1, f3, f4, etc.` to retain foundational information.
2. **Advanced Transformations**:
   - Multiplicative interactions such as `f5 f11 *` and `f8 f10 *` to explore interactions between features.
   - Use of `sin, cos, tanh` for capturing nonlinear relationships.
   - Logarithmic and square root transformations (`f6 log, f8 sqrt`) to manage skewness and highlight varying scales.
3. **Standard Scaling and Quantile/Log Transformations**: These transformations help in normalizing feature distributions and better separation in complex feature spaces.
4. **Reciprocal and Cube for New Insights**: Incorporating `f6 b reciprocal` and additional nonlinear transformations for capturing distinct aspects of data behavior.

This combined approach of retaining crucial base features while introducing diverse and complex transformations can lead to better predictive performance by capturing more intricate patterns within the dataset.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f4, f6, f7, f9, f10, f11, f16, f20, f0 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler, f18 stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler, f20 stand_scaler, f4 log, f6 log, f7 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f19 sqrt, f0 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler stand_scaler, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f0 f1 *, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f18 tanh, f20 tanh, f4 log stand_scaler, f10 cube, f11 reciprocal, f8 sigmoid, f7 f10 *, f9 cos stand_scaler stand_scaler]

2026-01-17 17:49:56,609 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature set examples, we can aim to create a better feature set by selecting relevant transformations and combinations while introducing new operations or compositions that may capture important interactions or non-linear relationships. Here's a new feature set proposal:

 f6 f7 cube]
```

Explanation:

1. Kept several original features but prioritized those with more potential influence based on typical industry knowledge around software metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, volume).
2. Maintained standard scaling on crucial features that likely need normalization to handle any outliner impact.
3. Retained logarithm transformations and trigonometric transformations for potential non-linear correlations.
4. Included reciprocal transformations to explore inverse relationships further.
5. Introduced combinations between new and varied features (e.g., f7 f2 /, f9 f10 * log) aiming to explore non-linear interactions.
6. Added `cube` operation to potentially capture complex, non-linear relationships from f6 and f7.
7. Added additional compositional transformations like `f0 f4 * tanh` to explore feature space interaction more intricately.
