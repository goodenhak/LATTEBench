you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

Here's an attempt at a better feature set:

2026-01-17 17:27:35,393 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given feature transformations and the operations allowed, we should aim to effectively capture non-linear relationships and improve the distribution characteristics of the data. The second example utilizes some new transformations like `sqrt`, which could capture moderate non-linearities. Let's build on this:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f4 log, f9 log, f11 log, f9 reciprocal, f11 reciprocal, f5 sigmoid, f9 square, f7 minmax_scaler, f3 + f19, f6 * f8, f14 / (f2 + 1)]
```

### Key Additions:

- **`f4 log`, `f9 log`, `f11 log`:** Applying a logarithmic transformation can help in cases where the data has an exponential growth behavior. It's effective for mitigating skewness and compressing large ranges.

- **`f9 reciprocal`, `f11 reciprocal`:** Reciprocals are useful for transforming variables with decay-like behavior and increasing variables' spread where values are clustered near zero.

- **`f5 sigmoid`:** Sigmoid function can convert input values into a range between 0 and 1, highlighting non-linearity, especially useful in cases where we want to focus on the middle range values.

- **`f7 minmax_scaler`:** This scaling effort ensures that this feature is accounted for in a normalized fashion across comparisons.

- **`f3 + f19`, `f6 * f8`:** Creating interaction terms can highlight relationships between features that may not be evident individually.

- **`f14 / (f2 + 1)`:** A simple ratio after scaling can reveal relative differences pertinent to defect prediction tasks. Adding 1 to avoid division by zero.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's the improved feature set:

```

In this feature set:
- I've included a mix of original and transformed features using sine, reciprocal, and addition operations.
- Used operations on pairs of features to capture potential interactions between them.
- Maintained transformations that have shown potential in the examples, like `sin`, and `reciprocal`.
- Combined features and then applied `sin` to the result to introduce non-linearity.
- Focused on keeping the feature set compact but effective by using each transformation strategically.

2026-01-17 17:27:46,620 - INFO - llm output = To combine elements from both feature sets and propose a better feature set, we can leverage transformations that have shown promise in each set. The first feature set example emphasizes quantile transformations, sin, and sqrt operations. The second example focuses on min-max scaling, arithmetic operations, and other transformations such as square, cos, and tanh. 

Here's a new feature set combining successful strategies from both sets:

```plaintext
[f0, f5, f7, f12, f0 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f1 cube, f5 sqrt, f8 quan_trans sqrt, f0 cos, f5 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f11 minmax_scaler, f10 sin, f7 quan_trans quan_trans sin, f8 quan_trans quan_trans sin, f5 cube sin, f6 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans sin, f11 tanh, f5 tanh, f5 cube sin sqrt, f11 cos, f5 sin sqrt, f9 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f11 tanh]
```

This feature set includes diverse transformations:
- Utilizes `quan_trans` and `sqrt` operations from the first set, as well as trigonometric transformations such as `sin`.
- Carries over `minmax_scaler` and `tanh` from the second set, which are useful for normalization and non-linear transformations.
- Incorporates some arithmetic and combination of transformations to explore potential complex relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:27:53,366 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set for predictions, focus on integrating meaningful transformations, avoiding redundant or overlapping transformations, and prioritizing features and transformations that potentially add predictive power. Here is an improved feature set based on the examples provided:

```
[f5 ,f8 ,f7 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f0 sqrt sqrt ,f6 sqrt sqrt ,f8 sqrt sqrt ,f10 sqrt sqrt ,f14 sqrt sqrt ,f9 f4 - ,f9 f5 - ,f9 f8 - ,f9 f12 - ,f9 f4 sqrt - ,f9 f0 sqrt sqrt - ,f11 f9 - f12 sqrt sqrt - ,f11 f9 - f8 sqrt - f5 sqrt - ,f11 f9 - f5 sqrt - f10 sqrt - ,f9 f7 sqrt sqrt stand_scaler ,f11 f9 - f5 sqrt - f9 f0 sqrt sqrt - ,f11 f9 - f5 sqrt - f9 f6 sqrt - -]
```

**Rationale:**

1. **Meaningful Pairings:** Maintain transformations that effectively combine relevant features (e.g., `f9 f4 -` and `f11 f9 - f8 sqrt - f5 sqrt -`), which could highlight differences in feature values contributing to predictions.

2. **Remove Redundancies:** Avoid adding unnecessary complexity with deeply nested transformations that might not add value (the second example is excessive in this regard).

3. **Scaling Important Features:** Scaling features like `f9 f7 sqrt sqrt` can help normalize their impact across samples, ensuring model robustness.

4. **Prioritize Key Features:** Focus transformations on features that have shown predictive power in the domain, like `f11` (Halstead effort) and `f5` (Halstead volume), while exploring their relationships (e.g., using `sqrt` and differences).

This optimized feature set aims to reduce redundancy, maintain meaningful transformations, and leverage statistical scaling techniques for enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Explanation:
- **Keep Core Features**: Retain and utilize foundational features from both examples to ensure key attributes are not lost.
- **Diverse Transformations**: Use a variety of transformations like reciprocal, tanh, logarithm, cube, and quantile transformation to cover different transformation aspects.
- **Complexity**: Apply transformations in layers (e.g., `quan_trans tanh`) for more complex feature interactions.
- **Select Additions**: Introduce new transformations where appropriate (`log` on select features) to explore potential non-linear relationships.
- **Combine Operations**: Use operations like addition between certain features to capture combined effects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:28:12,457 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, we can focus on combining transformations and feature interactions in a more effective way. The latter example focuses on trigonometric and quantile transformations, while the former incorporates scaling and polynomial transformations. A more balanced and potentially effective approach could be combining elements from both examples. Here's a suggested feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19,

 f3 sin, f18 stand_scaler, f9 sigmoid, f18 f9 *, f11 stand_scaler, 
 f9 sin sin, f5 sin sin, f5 sin, f9 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler sin]
```

This feature set takes advantage of polynomial expansions, which can capture non-linear relationships, while also incorporating trigonometric and scaling transformations from both original feature sets. The goal is to balance linear, non-linear, and scaled representations to potentially improve the prediction task.

New feature set:
```
[f5, f8, f9, f5 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f0 sqrt, f5 f0 +, f5 f7 +, f5 f6 f8 + +, f5 f9 f0 - +, f5 f9 f19 - +, f9 f0 - sqrt, f9 f8 - sqrt, f5 sqrt sqrt, f9 f0 - sqrt sqrt, f5 f0 + sqrt, f9 minmax_scaler, f7 quan_trans, f9 minmax_scaler sqrt, f5 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f5 log, f9 log, f8 log, f5 f9 log *, f5 f8 reciprocal +, f5 f9 f6 - sqrt +, f5 f9 f14 - sqrt +, f9 f14 - sqrt sqrt, f8 sigmoid, f5 f0 + sigmoid, f5 f9 f8 - sqrt + sigmoid, f5 f7 + sigmoid, f9 f0 - tanh, f9 tanh, f5 sinh, f8 sinh, f5 f8 sinh +, f9 sinh, f5 sinh sqrt, f5 sinh reciprocal]
```

This feature set includes:
1. Basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction) to capture potential interactions and relationships.
2. Square root transformations to handle skewness.
3. Reciprocal and logarithmic transformations to normalize features and potentially reduce non-linearity.
4. Min-max scaling to standardize features and handle outliers.
5. Non-linear activations such as sigmoid, tanh, and sinh to transform features to capture complex relationships. 

These transformations aim to create a feature space that enhances discrimination between modules with and without defects.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This set adds a combination of square root and logarithmic transformations, which can be helpful for normalizing the data distribution and emphasizing important features. Make sure the transformations are applied only to features with positive values to avoid mathematical errors. New combinations utilizing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division help create interactions between features, capturing non-linear relationships that might improve the prediction accuracy.

In this new feature set, I've incorporated log transformations (useful for handling skewness or distributions with long tails) and a combination of scaling operations (min-max and standard scaling) for features that were previously absent. These have been mixed with existing transformations like reciprocals, squares, cube, and hyperbolic functions to potentially capture non-linear patterns in the data. Additionally, I've added some combinations of transformations that could further aid in capturing underlying relationships in the data.

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Transforms & Sines**: Retained original and sine-transformed features for potential periodic patterns.
2. **Sqrt & Log Transforms**: Included original sqrt and log transforms for variance stabilization.
3. **Combinations**: Retained several combinations of features to capture interactions.
4. **New Transformations**: 
   - Included `cos` and `tanh` of some features for additional non-linearity.
   - Used `reciprocal` to handle potential inverse relationship.
   - Included `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to normalize certain features, possibly improving learning of linear models.

These additional transformations and variants may help capture complex patterns in the dataset related to software defects, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

2026-01-17 17:28:51,677 - INFO - llm output = To construct an improved feature set based on the two provided examples, we will focus on incorporating additional transformations and combinations that could capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features better. The new feature set should be more expressive, thus potentially improving the predictive performance of a downstream task.

Here is the new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f18, f19, f20, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal, f4 square, f0 tanh, f1 tanh, f3 tanh, f6 tanh, f7 tanh, f8 tanh, f10 tanh, f12 tanh, f14 tanh, f16 tanh, f17 tanh, f18 tanh, f19 tanh, f20 tanh, f0 reciprocal tanh, f1 reciprocal tanh, f3 reciprocal tanh, f20 reciprocal tanh, f4 square tanh, f9 cos, f9 cube, f9 f4 +, f5 log, f11 log, f0 f1 *, f3 f6 *, f4 f9 *, f0 f5 reciprocal, f8 f10 reciprocal, f7 f11 +]
```

### Key Additions:
1. **Log Transformation**: Adds `f5 log` and `f11 log` to capture unit changes in f5 and f11 which could correlate with defect density.
2. **Interaction Terms**: Includes products such as `f0 f1 *`, `f3 f6 *`, and `f4 f9 *` to capture interactions between different features which might be useful, given that combinations of factors can jointly determine software quality.
3. **Reciprocal Multiplications**: `f0 f5 reciprocal` and `f8 f10 reciprocal` links reciprocal transformations which could normalize influential features.
4. **Sum of Features**: Included `f7 f11 +` to explore the combined effect of these two features since `f7` and `f11` might capture complementary qualities of the software module.

These transformations can help in non-linear separability that might not be captured well with raw features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's the improved feature set:

```

In this improved feature set:
- I've included some standard scaling transformations from the first set since these often help in normalizing the distribution of feature values, which is beneficial for many machine learning algorithms. 
- Retained the `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, and `cos` functions as they could introduce useful non-linearity into the feature space.
- Added `square` transformation for `f9` since it captures higher-order interactions. 
- Utilized both intrinsic `sqrt` transformations from the latter example. 

These transformations are designed to preserve the intrinsic properties of the data while exploring non-linear and normalized transformations to better capture potential patterns indicating software defects.

### Additional Explanations:
- **New Transformations**:
  - **Square Root** and **Logarithm**: These are useful for stabilizing variance and handling right-skewed data.
  - **Hyperbolic Tangent** and **Sine**: Applied to certain features to capture nonlinear relationships.
  - **Reciprocal Sine** combinations: They explore interactions where one feature magnitude inversely affects another's sine-transformed value.
  - **Stand Scaler** and **Min-Max Scaler**: Normalizations applied to some features to bring them into comparable scales.

- **Feature Interactions**:
  - Multiplicative and additive interactions can capture correlations between raw and transformed variables.
  - Divisive combinations such as `f14 f15 /` may highlight complementary or inversely related effects.

The aim of these engineered features is to help downstream models capture a richer set of potential relationships within the data, increasing the likelihood of improved predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Given that the latter feature set includes a squared term, I will incorporate some higher-order interactions and non-linear transformations that might be beneficial. Here's the new feature set:

```

 f19 sqrt]
```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: All features from `f0` to `f19` are retained for base-level predictive power.
- **Interaction Terms**: Pairwise products and sums between some features are included to capture interactions.
- **Higher-order Terms**: Squared terms for a selection of features to account for potential non-linear effects.
- **Log Transformations**: Applied to some features to manage skewness and approximate normality.
- **Reciprocal Transformations**: Applied to a couple of features, potentially useful if they have strong inverse relationships.
- **Min-max Scaling**: Applied to some features to normalize the range between 0 and 1.
- **Ratios**: Ratios of selected features to highlight proportional relationships.
- **Hyperbolic Tangent**: Applied to some feature interactions to introduce a non-linear transformation.
- **Square Root**: Applied to `f19` for a smoother curvature transformation. 

These transformations are chosen with the intention to capture a broader range of patterns and interactions, potentially beneficial for improving the predictability of software defects.

2026-01-17 17:29:32,898 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided examples, the latter one includes a broader transformation set, combining square root, sigmoid, and cosine transformations along with standard scaling but does not apply transformations to as many features as the former. When crafting a better feature set, it's crucial to consider the diversity of transformations, the range of features they apply to, and ensure that the transformations have meaningful representation power, such as non-linear mappings that could capture more complex relationships. Let's create a more comprehensive feature set by incorporating elements from both examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 sqrt ,f11 sqrt ,f5 tanh ,f8 tanh ,f9 sigmoid ,f11 cos ,f9 square ,f5 cos ,f9 cos, f10 reciprocal ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 stand_scaler ,f10 stand_scaler ,f12 stand_scaler ,f14 stand_scaler ,f16 stand_scaler ,f17 stand_scaler ,f18 stand_scaler ,f19 stand_scaler ,f20 stand_scaler ,f11 cos stand_scaler ,f9 sigmoid stand_scaler ,f9 square stand_scaler ,f5 tanh stand_scaler]
```

This improved feature set includes:

1. Utilization of non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `square`, `cos`, and `sqrt` to capture complex patterns.
2. Application of these transformations across a broader range of features.
3. Use of `reciprocal` for possible inverse relationship exploration.
4. Standard scaling is applied to the raw features and their non-linear transformations to maintain the data scale consistent and aid in model convergence.

This new combined feature set effectively balances transformation variety, feature coverage, and utility for potentially improved model predictions.

- **Sine transformations:** Apply sine transformations to impactful features with distortions already signaled in the examples, enhancing non-linearity.
- **Reciprocal transformations:** Use reciprocal transformations to emphasize variations in smaller-valued features.
- **Combinatory augmentations:** Operate on combined augmented features such as f5 f9 +, f9 f11 +.
- **Nonlinearity through sin combinations:** Retain and introduce combinations of sin operations on reciprocal or squared transformations to explore non-linear interactions without over-complicating with multiple nested functions.

The goal is to improve model interpretability and performance by applying diverse transformations and interactions. Here is a suggested feature set:

``` 
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f14, f16, f19, f0 quan_trans, f1 quan_trans, f3 quan_trans, f4 quan_trans, f5 quan_trans, f6 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f8 quan_trans, f9 quan_trans, f10 quan_trans, f14 quan_trans, f16 quan_trans, f19 quan_trans, f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f16 stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler, f9 sigmoid, f11 cos, f5 cos, f9 square, f9 f9 *, f12 sin, f14 stand_scaler sin, f9 quan_trans sin, f4 cos]
```

### Key Choices and Improvements:
1. **Diverse Base Features**: I've included a wide mix of base features from both examples to ensure coverage of important metrics.
2. **Quantile Transformation**: Applied on strategically chosen features that seemed nonlinear.
3. **Standard Scaling**: Ensured that features are centered and scaled, particularly those prone to large value ranges.
4. **Trigonometric Functions (Sin and Cos)**: Explored on various features to capture periodicity or nonlinearity.
5. **Sigmoid and Square Transformations**: To introduce non-linear separability.
6. **Feature Interactions**: Include multiplication of `f9` with itself to explore non-linear relationships.

This feature set is carefully designed to leverage data transformations and interactions that can improve the predictive power of models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:29:58,417 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the given transformations, we can combine and extend the operations to derive new useful features for the prediction task. The goal is to explore interactions between features and apply transformations that can capture nonlinear relationships. Here, I will propose a new feature set that builds upon the examples provided:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f9 sqrt ,f5 square ,f9 f5 * ,f7 log]
```

### Explanation:

1. **`f9 sqrt`**: Taken from the first example, applying square root transformation can normalize the distribution and reduce skewness.
   
2. **`f5 square`**: Taken from the second example, squaring can capture potential quadratic relationships.

3. **`f9 f5 *`**: A new feature interaction by multiplying `f9` and `f5`, capturing interaction between these features which could provide additional insights into their joint effect on the target variable.

4. **`f7 log`**: Applying log transformation to `f7` (representing `% Halstead 'difficulty'`) can help in dealing with skewed data and making the distribution of this feature more normal, which can lead to better model performance. 

By suggesting these transformations and interactions, we're aiming to capture potential nonlinear effects and interactions that might be significant for the defect prediction task.

```

Improvements and rationale:
1. **Additional Interactions**: I've added interactions such as `f11 f5 /` (ratio of Halstead 'effort' to Halstead 'volume'), which may capture the efficiency of the coding effort.
2. **Multiplicative Features**: Included product-based features, e.g., `f9 f6 *` (interaction between Halstead's effort and 'program length'), to reflect complex relationships.
3. **Advanced Transforms**: Added `f20 log` to capture the logarithmic behavior of the 'branchCount,' potentially smoothing out outliers.
4. **New Combinations**: Introduced `f2 f17 tanh *` (a combination leveraging essential complexity and unique operators with a non-linear transformation) to assess fundamental code complexity effects.
5. **Enhanced Composite Feature**: Used `f9 f19 sqrt +` for a more robust, composite feature for total operators combined with a transformation to emphasize dominant patterns.

These transformations aim to uncover hidden patterns in the features for improved predictions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a new improved feature set:

```

This new feature set includes:
- A mix of basic features for foundational representation.
- Polynomial and trigonometric transformations that allow for capturing nonlinear patterns and potential periodic relationships.
- Operations such as reciprocal, sigmoid, and standard scaling that normalize or bound feature values, potentially leading to improved model performance or stability.
- Combinations of features through addition, multiplication, and min-max scaling, to capture interactions or dependencies between different features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Changes and considerations:
- Added `f7 square` to capture additional non-linearity in the dataset.
- Included `f5 tanh` and `f15 tanh` to exploit the properties of the hyperbolic tangent.
- Added `f12 f6 *` to explore interactions between features `f12` and `f6`.
- Introduced logarithmic and square root transformations for `f2` and `f11` to capture potential polynomial relationships.
- Applied `quantile_transform` to `f11` and `f17` for potential normal distribution transformation, which can be useful for certain ML models.
- Added `minmax_scaler` to features `f10` and `f0` to normalize their values to a 0-1 range.
- Applied `quantile_transform` and `minmax_scaler` to `f6` and `f0` respectively, to adjust to limit risks of outliers.

These transformations aim to introduce non-linear interactions, explore relationships through trigonometric functions, and adjust feature distributions to enhance the predictive capabilities of machine learning models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:30:27,248 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the given examples, we want to capture useful transformations and interactions among the features that might help in the downstream task (like defect prediction). We can incorporate statistical transformations, interactions, and functional transformations that might capture underlying patterns in the data. Here's the new feature set proposal:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 sqrt, f5 square, f9 f5 *, f7 log, f0 f1 /, f2 f3 +, f8 f14 *, f9 f18 -, f16 f19 /, f13 f20 square, f7 f8 sqrt, f11 f5 tanh, f17 f15 cos]
```

In this proposal, I've considered various transformations:
- Multiplicative interactions like `f9 f5 *` and `f8 f14 *` to capture product relationships between features.
- Additive and subtractive interactions like `f2 f3 +`, `f9 f18 -`, and `f16 f19 /` to derive new potential linear combinations informative for prediction.
- Functional transformations like `f7 log`, `f11 f5 tanh`, and `f17 f15 cos` to help capture non-linear relationships and additional patterns in the data.
- Division-based transformation `f0 f1 /` to assess the ratio-related attributes between two features, which may provide insight into their relative measure.
- Square, square root, and their combinations like `f5 square`, `f9 sqrt`, `f13 f20 square`, and `f7 f8 sqrt` to explore effects of variance and scale in the data.

These feature transformations aim to enrich the dataset by representing the relationships between original features in a way that may capture more complex interactions and potential influential predictors for your model.

In this improved feature set:
- I've retained important features and transformations from the examples.
- Added some new transformed features like `f9 square minmax_scaler`, `f5 cos * f7`, and `f20 log` to capture interactions and non-linearity.
- Applied transformations and scaling to potentially significant features based on both examples.
- Created additional interaction terms and nonlinear transformations to capture complex relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

This set applies a variety of transformations to the original features to capture non-linear relations and interactions, which can be especially useful in predicting software defects. Transformations like square root, sine, logarithm, tanh, and cube are included alongside interactions between features to potentially uncover hidden structures or relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:30:53,056 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set from the given examples, we'll combine relevant transformations and introduce additional operations to capture more complex patterns. Here’s an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19, 
f0 sin, f1 sin, f3 sin, f4 sin, f5 sin, f6 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f12 sin, f16 sin, f19 sin,

f14 f0 -, f17 f18 +, f7 f11 /, f5 f2 square, f19 log]
```

### Explanation of new additions:
- **f0 stand_scaler**: Standardize `f0` to have zero mean and unit variance can enhance its interpretability in the presence of other scaled features.
- **f19 reciprocal**: The reciprocal might capture interesting inverse relationships.
- **f3 f7 ***: Interaction between `f3` and `f7` could capture multiplicative effects useful for the model.
- **f8 f5 /**: Dividing `f8` by `f5` looks at proportional change, which can help in understanding rates or ratios.
- **f6 f9 +**: Adding `f6` and `f9` may capture additive interactions between these features.
- **f14 f0 -**: Subtracting `f0` from `f14` allows analysis of their difference, yielding information about relative magnitudes.
- **f17 f18 +**: Additive interactions between `f17` and `f18`.
- **f7 f11 /**: Dividing `f7` by `f11` captures another possible rate or ratio indicator.
- **f5 f2 square**: Applying square transformation on `f5` while multiplied by `f2`, enhances feature nonlinearity.
- **f19 log**: Log transformation of `f19` makes heavily tailed distributions more symmetrical, stabilizing variance. 

These transformations create new features aimed at capturing more complex data patterns and potentially improving model accuracy.

```

- Maintained the existing fundamental features `[f0, f1, ..., f20]` for baseline information.
- Kept useful transformations from both examples such as `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `cos`, `square`, and `stand_scaler`.
- Enhanced focus on potentially impactful features and transformations that address non-linear relationships, such as adding reciprocal transformations (`f0 reciprocal`, `f1 reciprocal`, `f20 reciprocal`) and `tanh` transformations for selected features.
- Eliminated excessively compounded transformations which can lead to complexity without guarantee of added value.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f11, f10 sin, f12 sin, f17 sin, f0 sin sin, f6 sin sin, f7 sin sin, f9 sin sin, f19 sin sin, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f4 sin sin sin, f6 sin sin sin, f9 sin sin sin, f10 sin sin sin, f14 sin sin sin, f8 f8 +, f9 f11 +, f3 sin, f9 f11 + sin] 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f5 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f16 ,f17 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 sin ,f9 sin ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f4 reciprocal ,f7 reciprocal ,f8 reciprocal ,f10 reciprocal ,f20 reciprocal ,f5 sin sin ,f9 sin sin ,f11 sin sin ,f0 reciprocal sin ,f1 reciprocal sin ,f7 sin sin ,f8 sin sin ,f10 sin sin ,f16 sin sin ,f19 sin sin ,f20 sin sin ,f4 f4 + ,f9 f11 + ,f8 f8 + ,f9 f10 + ,f0 f1 *,f5 f7 *,f5 f9 + ,f2 f6 + ,f3 f8 + ,f7 f10 + ,f8 f11 + ,f10 f11 + sin]

2026-01-17 17:31:04,239 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and their transformations, we can derive a new and improved feature set. This new set will incorporate the most promising transformations from the provided examples while introducing some additional transformations to enhance predictive power:

1. Start by including features that appear consistently in both examples.
2. Include some complex transformations that involve multiple operations.

Here's a suggestion for a new, better feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f16, f17, f19, f20, 
f5 sin, f9 sin, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f4 reciprocal, 
f7 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal, 
f5 sin sin, f9 sin sin, f11 sin sin, f0 reciprocal sin, f1 reciprocal sin, 
f7 sin sin, f8 sin sin, f10 sin sin, f16 sin sin, f19 sin sin, f20 sin sin, 
f4 f4 +, f8 f8 +, f9 f11 +, f9 f10 +, f0 f1 *, f5 f7 *, f5 f9 +, 
f2 f6 +, f3 f8 +, f7 f10 +, f8 f11 +, 
f0 cube, f1 cube, f9 cube, 
f0 f9 /, f7 f11 /, 
f10 f17 + sin, f8 f19 * cos]
```

### Key Additions:
- **Complex Mathematical Operations:** Introducing cube transformations and division operations to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Combinations of Features:** Including combinations like `f0 f9 /` and `f7 f11 /` to capture proportional relationships.
- **Recursive Transcendental Functions:** Extending the usage of transcendental functions (`sin`, `cos`) on combination features to capture cyclic patterns.

This feature set aims to leverage the strengths of complex and non-linear transformations, which can potentially improve the predictive performance of the downstream task.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:31:10,429 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for better predictions based on the two provided examples and the operations available, let's try to create a more informative transformation that can potentially help in the defect prediction task. 

The first example adds the square of `f5`, potentially emphasizing the non-linear impact of this feature. The second example subtracts `f9` from itself, which is effectively zero and doesn't add much value. However, such an operation can sometimes be a precursor to scaling or normalizing operations.

Let's propose a new feature set that might encode useful information:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 f9 * sqrt]
```

**Explanation:**
- `f5 f9 *`: Multiplying `f5` and `f9` might capture interactions between these two features that are not evident when they are considered individually.
- `sqrt`: Taking the square root of the product can help manage the scaling, especially since `f5` and `f9` can be large, and emphasize small product values more evenly. This non-linear transformation could potentially highlight areas of the data with specific characteristics relevant for defect prediction.

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **Selection of Diverse Transformations**: Utilizing a mix of transformations like reciprocal, tanh, square, cube, and logarithm to handle different scales and distributions in data, while maintaining diverse nonlinear interactions.

2. **Combination of Techniques**: By combining techniques such as `quan_trans` and `stand_scaler` with transformations like `cos` and `sigmoid`, we ensure not only scaling but also nonlinear behavior capture.

3. **Introduction of Feature Interactions**: Using operations like addition and multiplication between transformed features captures interaction effects which can be useful for prediction tasks.

4. **Balanced Complexity**: While increased features may lead to better learning, keeping transformations manageable ensures model interpretability and prevents overfitting.

This new set leverages the transformations and calculations to enhance predictive modeling, by expanding upon nonlinear relationships and scaling within the dataset.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:31:20,922 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, the latter set introduces a wider variety of transformation techniques beyond sinusoidal transformations, including logarithms, square roots, hyperbolic tangent, sigmoid, and cubic transformations. These transformations can capture more complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Additionally, the latter set includes scaling (min-max scaler), which can help standardize feature ranges.

Here is a new feature set that further incorporates useful transformations to potentially enhance predictive capability:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19,

 f5 sin sin, f1 sin sin, 
 f5 f1 /, f2 f3 *, f8 f9 +, f10 f11 -, f14 f17 +, f9 f18 -, f4 sin, 
 f0 log, f1 log, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, 
 f10 sigmoid, f11 sigmoid, f19 cube, 
 f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler,
 f6 reciprocal, f7 log, f8 sqrt, f11 tanh, 
 f2 cube, f3 cube, 
 f7 f8 *, f9 f16 -, 
 f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler]
```

This feature set adds some additional diverse transformations which could help in capturing more complex patterns, including reciprocal, another logarithm and square root, and standardized scaling. The mixture of transformations can potentially improve the model's performance by giving it access to a richer, more diverse set of feature representations.

Explanation of new additions:
- `f5 f6 *`: Create interaction terms for features that would logically multiply such as difficulty and program length.
- `f7 f19 +`: Combine related features to capture potential additive effects.
- `f8 f9 /`: Explore the ratio between effort and volume for insight into efficiency.
- `f0 f10 *`: Capture interactions between line count of the code and another relevant measure.
- `f4 cos minmax_scaler`: Apply a cosine transformation followed by scaling to capture cyclical aspects.
- `f9 cos sqrt`: Apply a square root to cosined volume to better handle non-linearity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:31:37,348 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, the goal is to improve the feature set by constructing a new set that builds on the transformations provided and capitalizes on potential non-linear patterns while reducing redundancy. Here’s an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19, 
 f0 sin, f1 sin, f5 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f12 sin, f16 sin, f17 sin,

 f9 minmax_scaler sin, 
 f17 sin sin sin sin, 
 f18 sin sin, f20 sin sin]
```

### Key considerations:
1. **Selection of Features**: I kept a broad base of features from both sets while aiming to include more meaningful interactions and transformations. 
2. **Retained Transformations**: Used `sin`, as it’s prevalent in both examples, indicating potentially useful nonlinear interactions. Also included `quan_trans` and `minmax_scaler` based on their presence in the second feature set.
3. **Deeper Transformations**: In cases where deep chained transformations are present, included a few additional layers to capture intricate patterns.
4. **Reduction**: Streamlined some redundancy to minimize complexity while preserving depth where beneficial.

This set aims to incorporate diverse transformations and interactions while maintaining a manageable level of complexity.

- This includes both the square transformation of `f5` and the logarithm of `f7` from the second set.
- It also incorporates a multiplication of the square root of `f5` with `f4`, potentially capturing interactions between these features.
- The hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) transformation of `f6` can introduce non-linearities which might be beneficial for capturing complex relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

```

Enhancements: 
1. Utilized transformations such as `tanh`, `square`, and `cos` which could help with non-linearity.
2. Included reciprocal transformations to handle skewness and enhance variability. 
3. Added more interaction terms to capture potential non-linear relationships and interactions among features which could improve the model performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:31:54,777 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the given examples, we need to strategically combine the transformations and interactions to provide potential improvements for the defect prediction task. Here’s a refined feature set:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f9 sqrt, f5 square, f9 f5 *, f7 log, f8 f1 /, f2 f5 *, f10 f9 -, reciprocal f6, f4 minmax_scaler, f3 f2 +, f14 f19 cos, f7 f0 sin, f11 tanh, f17 quan_trans] 

In this feature set:

1. Basic features (f0 to f20) are maintained for direct use.
2. Added interaction between `f8` and `f1` using division, potentially capturing interaction effects.
3. Multiplied `f2` and `f5` to explore combined complexity or distance metrics.
4. Subtracted `f9` from `f10` to find differentials or discrepancies.
5. Used reciprocal transformation on `f6` to reflect the inverse relationship.
6. Applied min-max scaling to `f4` to normalize it between 0 and 1.
7. Combined `f3` and `f2` using addition to explore cumulative effects.
8. Applied the cosine transformation on `f14` and `f19` to explore periodic patterns.
9. Used the sine transformation on `f7` with `f0` for interaction capturing.
10. Applied tanh activation to `f11` to squeeze values into a range between -1 and 1, useful for outlier handling.
11. Employed quantile transformation on `f17` to make the feature more uniformly distributed. 

These transformations aim to introduce non-linearity, normalize the data, and explore meaningful interactions, potentially improving the performance of defect prediction models.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression.

```
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,

### Explanation:
- **Retained Core Features**: Like in the second set, the core features (f0 to f20) are kept, as they form the foundation of our dataset.
- **Advanced Transforms**: This set utilizes logarithmic (f18 log) and reciprocal (f5 reciprocal) transformations, which are not present in previous examples and could highlight multiplicative or diminishing returns in certain features.
- **Square and Cosine Transformations**: Retains the squared and cos transformations for breadth in feature representation. 
- **Standard Scaler**: Most features have been standardized for consistent scaling, which is essential for machine learning algorithms.
- **Enhanced Feature Interactions**: Includes interactions like addition (f3 f4 +) and subtraction (f7 f6 -) between features that may co-work or cancel out each other, providing additional insights or simplifications.
- **Square Root**: The sqrt transform is retained and scaled for normalization, as seen with `f11 sqrt stand_scaler`.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:32:07,384 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, it's important to identify a new feature set that maintains the diversity and complexity of transformations, while potentially improving the utility of the features for predictive purposes. The second provided feature set emphasizes deeper compositions of trigonometric functions, which might be indicative of capturing non-linear patterns more effectively. We'll aim to incorporate deep compositions and variations in our new feature set, while also retaining some operations from the first set for balance:

```
[f0, f1, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f19, f5 square, f0 cube, f4 cube, f7 sin, f8 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f12 sin, f16 sin, f18 sin, f5 sin sin, f9 sin sin, f5 cube, f8 cube, f10 cube, f12 cube, f11 stand_scaler, f9 quan_trans, f9 sigmoid, f0 sin, f3 sin, f9 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler sin, f5 sin sin sin, f9 quan_trans sin sin, f0 log sin, f6 sin sin, f8 sin sin, f10 sin sin, f18 sin sin, f20 sin sin]
```

In this new set:
1. Retain diverse trigonometric transformations, like `sin`, and their compositions to account for potential non-linear relationships.
2. Include deeper compositions of `sin` functions for potentially improved non-linear pattern capturing.
3. Incorporate a balanced mix of other transformations like `stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler`.
4. Retain the cube and square transformations for variance and interaction effects.
5. Introduce logarithmic transformations to manage skewed distributions and potential multiplicative relationships.
  
This balanced approach aims to capture non-linear relationships while ensuring a diversity of transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:32:12,477 - INFO - llm output = Based on the previous examples and transformations, we can create a better feature set by building upon the second example (which includes `f5 square`), and introduce a combination of previously unused transformations or combining them in a novel way. Let's combine some useful transformations like multiplication and square root for a potential interaction term and keep the scalable transformations for numerical stability. Here's a suggestion:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f5 f9 * sqrt , f5 square]

This includes the following elements:
- All original features `[f0, f1, ..., f20]`.
- A new interaction feature obtained by taking the square root of the product of `f5` and `f9`, similar to a geometric mean which often serves well as an interaction term for multiplicative relationships.
- Retain the square of feature `f5`, which was present in the previously better example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:32:18,193 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, we can engineer a better feature set by combining elements from both examples and introducing some additional transformations while ensuring the transformed features may enhance the predictive power for software defect prediction. Here is an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f14, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20,
f9 cos, f9 sigmoid, f9 square, f5 cos, f9 cos,
f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f14 stand_scaler, f16 stand_scaler, f17 stand_scaler, f18 stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler, f20 stand_scaler,
f11 cos stand_scaler, f9 sigmoid stand_scaler, f9 square stand_scaler, f5 cos stand_scaler, f9 cos stand_scaler,
f4 cos stand_scaler, f9 f9 *,
f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f20 reciprocal,
f9 tanh, f9 tanh square,
f6 cube tanh, 
f5 cube,
f4 log, f8 log,
f19 quan_trans tanh]
```

In this new feature set, we have:

1. Retained a core set of original features that appear to be useful.
2. Included both scaling transformations (using `stand_scaler`) and nonlinear transformations (using operations like `cos`, `sigmoid`, `square`, `cube`, `tanh`).
3. Combined transformations for deeper feature extraction (e.g., `f6 cube tanh`, `f9 tanh square`).
4. Applied some log transformations to potentially normalize the range of feature values that have broad or skewed distributions (e.g., `f4 log`, `f8 log`).

This combined feature set attempts to balance normalization, non-linearity, and complexity enhancements to improve the downstream predictive task.
