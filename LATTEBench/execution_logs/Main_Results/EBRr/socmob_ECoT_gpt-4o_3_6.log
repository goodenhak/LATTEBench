Given this, I would create the better feature set by combining these concepts:

```

- `sigmoid` and `minmax_scaler` are used to normalize the features.
- `sqrt` and `tanh` provide additional non-linear transformations.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4 log, f4 minmax_scaler, f2 f3 *, f0 f1 +, f4 f4 sqrt *, f3 f3 quan_trans +, f4 f2 * sin]
```

In this feature set:
- **`f0, f1, f2, f3`:** Retain original categorical features for transformation.
- **`f4 log`:** Transformation of the count feature into a logarithmic scale, reducing skewness for high values.
- **`f4 minmax_scaler`:** Normalizes `f4` between 0 and 1.
- **`f2 f3 *`:** Interaction effect between features `f2` and `f3`, useful to capture dependent structures.
- **`f0 f1 +`:** Combined effect of `f0` and `f1` considering their categories contribute together.
- **`f4 f4 sqrt *`:** Combination of `f4` transformed by its square root.
- **`f3 f3 quan_trans +`:** Quantile transformation on squared feature `f3` to capture nonlinear distributions.
- **`f4 f2 * sin`:** Nonlinear transformation combining `f4` and `f2` applying a sine function to the product, enhancing variability.

This feature set is designed to capture relationships and transformations that might reveal complex patterns in the data related to the son's occupation prediction task.

2026-01-19 20:41:55,196 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, the goal is to create an improved feature set by combining and enhancing the transformations applied in the examples. We aim to capture non-linear relationships and standardize or scale the data as needed, while exploring a variety of transformations to potentially expose underlying patterns.

Here is a new feature set inspired by the two examples:

```

```

Explanation:
- I included basic transformations like `sqrt` for capturing non-linearities and normalizing distributions.
- Various scaling and normalization techniques such as `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and `quan_trans` are used to handle data scaling and distribution issues.
- The use of `sigmoid` helps capture non-linear transformations, while the combination with `stand_scaler` can standardize these transformations.
- More complex combinations, like nested `sigmoid` and scaling transformations, are included to potentially capture more complex interactions the model might learn from.

2026-01-19 20:42:38,065 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets and their postfix expressions, the goal is to create a more effective feature set for the downstream task, taking inspiration from the transformations that have been applied in the examples.

Both provided sets extensively use transformations like `sigmoid`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler`, alongside trigonometric functions and arithmetic operations to create derived features. These transformations aim to normalize, scale, or otherwise derive meaningful variations of the original `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` feature (`f4`). 

To propose a better feature set for improving prediction performance, we'll combine insights from both examples, focusing on transformations that may better capture non-linear relationships and distribution characteristics. Here is a proposed set:

```plaintext
[f4, f4 stand_scaler sqrt, f4 quan_trans log, f4 f4 * minmax_scaler cos, f4 quan_trans tanh cos, f4 f4 * quan_trans sin, f4 f4 * tanh, f4 log sqrt sin, f4 sin tanh, f4 f4 * sqrt quan_trans tanh, f4 minmax_scaler sqrt cos]
```

Explanation:
1. `f4 stand_scaler sqrt`: Standard scaling followed by square root helps stabilize variance and can be useful if the data is skewed.
2. `f4 quan_trans log`: Quantile transformation followed by log normalizes the distribution and handles skew.
3. `f4 f4 * minmax_scaler cos`: This scales squared counts and applies the cosine function, potentially highlighting cyclic patterns.
4. `f4 quan_trans tanh cos`: Applies a s-shaped transformation after normalization, potentially emphasizing outliers or mid-range values.
5. `f4 f4 * quan_trans sin`: Applies a sinusoidal transformation which could highlight periodic patterns.
6. `f4 f4 * tanh`: Applying tanh can capture non-linearities in the data.
7. `f4 log sqrt sin`: Logarithm and square root transformations stabilize variance, followed by sine for cyclical pattern detection.
8. `f4 sin tanh`: Sequentially applying sine and tanh transformations can enhance complex patterns.
9. `f4 f4 * sqrt quan_trans tanh`: Combines non-linear and normalization transforms to emphasize higher-order details.
10. `f4 minmax_scaler sqrt cos`: Combines scaling with trigonometric transforms to enhance feature expressiveness. 

This set aims to leverage transformations that can help align the distribution of `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` with assumptions made by various predictive models, focusing on non-linear patterns and scaling that may improve predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-19 20:42:44,805 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two new feature set examples you provided, the latter feature set includes basic operations and primarily uses original features without much transformation. The aim is to create a more complex, informative feature utilizing transformations, as demonstrated in the first set. The objective is to generate a feature that captures intricate patterns and provides significant information for the prediction task by applying transformations.

Here is a potential better feature set, leveraging transformations effectively:

```plaintext
[f1 f4 minmax_scaler - sigmoid log stand_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler cube sigmoid log ,f0 f4 minmax_scaler + tanh ,f1 f2 * stand_scaler ,f3 sqrt stand_scaler ,f4 f4 * sqrt log stand_scaler]
```

In this feature set:
- The first two features are taken from your first example, as they provide complex transformations that might capture insightful patterns.
- The third feature combines the effect of father's occupation together with son's first occupation count after normalization, capturing non-linear interactions with `tanh`.
- The fourth and fifth features explore interactions and transformations of `f1` (son's occupation) and `f2` (family structure), and `f3` (race) respectively, potentially capturing non-linear relationships after standard scaling.
- The last feature uses `f4` (counts for son's first occupation) and explores its non-linear transformation through squaring, taking square root, and log operations.

This approach should provide a rich representation for the downstream predictive modeling tasks.

```

**Explanation:**

- Include `f4` and `f4 tanh` to capture both the raw and non-linear transformation aspects.
- Square `f4` to enhance the non-linear effect, useful for capturing variance.
- `f4 sqrt` and `f4 log` can help in normalizing skewed distributions and better handling variability, especially for higher count values regarding `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
- Applying quantile transformation and scaling techniques like `stand_scaler` helps in standardizing the distribution, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.
- Use non-linear functions such as `sin` and `sigmoid` combined with transformations to capture cyclic behaviors and compressing the feature values, which might lead to better separability in classification.
- Integrating transformations (e.g., `f4 f4 * quan_trans sin`) leverages complex interactions between variables and transformations, potentially uncovering hidden relationships in the data.

This feature set will provide a blend of simple, complex, and non-linear transformed features, potentially enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between classes in predicting the counts for the son's current occupation.

2026-01-19 20:43:28,324 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and the operations mentioned, the goal is to transform features in a way that might enhance the predictive power for the task at hand. 

In the first set, a variety of transformations are applied, including standard scaling, quantile transformations, cube transformations, and combinations of these using basic arithmetic operations. In the second set, the transformations rely more on multiplication and the use of the sigmoid function.

Combining ideas from both sets while favoring transformations that might better reveal relationships in the data, we get:

```
[f4 stand_scaler f2 sigmoid * ,f4 f3 stand_scaler sigmoid * cube ,f4 f4 f0 * sigmoid f3 f1 * * +]
```

Explanation:
- The first transformation scales `f4` and then multiplies it by the sigmoid of `f2`, potentially capturing non-linear relationships while standardizing `f4`.
- The second transformation scales `f3`, applies the sigmoid function, then multiplies with `f4` and cubes the result. This includes non-linear transformations and interaction between features `f4` and `f3`.
- The third transformation applies the sigmoid function after multiplying `f4` with itself and `f0`, incorporates an arithmetic combination with interactions between `f3` and `f1`.

These transformations attempt to build upon and merge the most potentially informative transformations from the provided examples.

- I retained transformations like `quan_trans`, `stand_scaler`, and `sin` to potentially normalize and map the data into spaces that may better capture complex relationships.
- Included `reciprocal` and `log` for their ability to linearize exponential relationships and stabilize variance.
- Incorporated combinations that might amplify important variations, e.g., `sqrt tanh f4 *`, which applies the hyperbolic tangent to a square root transformation, before scaling by `f4`.
- Added `minmax_scaler` to maintain some feature ranges consistent, improving model stability and sensitivity.

Explanation:
1. `f4 tanh stand_scaler`: Applying the hyperbolic tangent (non-linear transformation) followed by standard scaling helps in normalizing the data and accentuating its nuances.
2. `f4 sigmoid log stand_scaler cube`: This combines the effects of both non-linear transformations (sigmoid and log), followed by scaling and cubing, to potentially capture intricate patterns in the data.
3. `f3 stand_scaler sigmoid`: Standard scaling on `f3` followed by the sigmoid transformation may help adjust and then compress data scales, useful for binary classification tasks.

1. `f4 quant_trans f0 sigmoid *` applies a quantile transformation to `f4` and then multiplies it by the sigmoid of `f0`, helping to model non-linear interactions.
2. `f3 f1 stand_scaler / sqrt` divides `f3` by the standard-scaled `f1` and then applies a square root to capture the interaction between these two standardized features.
3. `f4 f0 minmax_scaler * f3 reciprocal + log` multiplies `f4` with `f0` after min-max scaling, adds the reciprocal of `f3`, and then applies a logarithmic transformation to capture multiplicative and reciprocal interactions.

- `f1 minmax_scaler` scales the son's occupation to a range, enhancing numerical stability for categorical data when used in models.
- `f3 stand_scaler` standardizes the family structure feature, centering it around zero and ensuring that distinct categories don't influence one another disproportionately.
- `f4 reciprocal` is applied on the counts for the son's first occupation to handle skewness in this continuous variable, especially considering its wide range and high standard deviation.

- The use of `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `cube`, and `sqrt` transformations provides nonlinear scaling and interaction between features which might help in differentiating patterns more effectively.
- Including `reciprocal`, `log`, and `square` helps manage skewness and create new interaction dynamics.
- The `minmax_scaler` can be useful for normalizing specific combinations of attributes, potentially improving model convergence.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The latter example focuses more on scaling and transforming the `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` feature (`f4`) using functions like `quan_trans`, `stand_scaler`, and `sigmoid`. My new feature set will prioritize similar operations and include the other features:

Explanation:
- Retained core features such as `f3` and `f4` which are likely to be important for predicting `counts_for_sons_first_occupation`.
- Used various transformations such as `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `minmax_scaler`, `log`, `reciprocal`, etc., to capture non-linear relationships and scaling effects.
- Simplified some transformations to focus on important patterns without overfitting.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

The goal is to capture non-linearities, normalize the distributions, and expand feature space for potentially better predictive performance.

Here's a new feature set that combines and enhances the transformations applied in the two given examples:

This feature set consolidates and introduces some additional transformations such as `tanh` and `log` to further capture non-linear relationships and scale down the values, especially for features that may be highly skewed.
