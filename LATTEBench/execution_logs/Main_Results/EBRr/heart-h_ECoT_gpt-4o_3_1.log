The goal is to incorporate a mix of nonlinear transformations, scaling, and derived features to capture underlying patterns in the data. 

Here’s a better-improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

### Explanation:
1. **Linearity and Scaling**: I've used basic arithmetic and scaling transformations like division, subtraction, minmax scaling, and logarithms to address non-linearity and scale dependencies.

2. **Nonlinear and Interaction**: Cubic, square root, reciprocal, and log transformations along with interactions between features help capture complex relationships.

3. **Stacking Sigmoid and Tanh**: Applying sigmoid and tanh functions to normalized or transformed features can capture more nuanced relationships and help with non-linear boundaries between classes.

By considering variability, potential interaction, and distribution of features, these transformations aim to improve feature representation for the downstream prediction task where predicting the presence of heart disease in patients is the goal.

We aim to incorporate advanced transformations and additional interactions while ensuring we cover diverse transformations and interactions without excessively increasing complexity.

Here's a proposed feature set that combines elements from both examples:

```
[f0, f3, f4, f7, f8, f12, f4 minmax_scaler, f4 tanh, f4 square, f1 f4 +, f5 f4 +, f6 f4 +, f8 f4 +, f12 f4 +, f4 minmax_scaler f4 +, f4 tanh f4 +, f4 square f4 +, f1 f4 + cos, f5 f4 + cos, f6 f4 + cos, f8 f4 + cos, f9 f4 + cos, f4 tanh f4 + cos, f4 square f4 + cos, f6 f8 + f9 f5 + + f8 f3 log + +, f12 f8 + f8 f12 + +, f6 f8 + f9 f5 + + f3 log f8 + +, f6 f8 + f1 f10 + +]
```

This feature set includes:

- Direct uses of some original features such as `f0`, `f3`, `f4`, `f7`, `f8`, `f12`.
- Transformed versions of `f4` using `minmax_scaler`, `tanh`, and `square`.
- Combinations of original features with `f4`, such as `f1 f4 +`, `f5 f4 +`, `f6 f4 +`.
- Combinations of original features with additional transformations, like `cos` applied to sums that include `f4`.
- Interactions that include `f6 f8 + f9 f5 + + f8 f3 log + +` and other complex combinations for potentially capturing complex relationships.
  
This set strikes a balance between straightforward transformations and more complex interactions, aimed at uncovering hidden patterns and improving prediction performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Root & Cube:** Applied to all features to capture non-linear relationships.

2. **Standard Scaler & Min-Max Scaler:** These normalized versions help algorithms converge faster and perform better as many machine learning algorithms perform better with normalized input data.

3. **Log and Squared Roots of Combinations:** These transformations of combinations might capture interactions and non-linearities between different features.

4. **Hyperbolic & Sigmoid Functions:** These can capture additional non-linear aspects.

5. **Feature Combination:** Added some summations and interactions between features to see possible synergies between them.

6. **Cubed Features:** Exploring higher order relationships.

These transformations and combinations can lead to a richer feature space, potentially uncovering important relationships that could improve predictive performance.

Explanation:

1. **Keep Original Features**: Retain important original features that might have directly interpretable relevance, including age (f0), sex (f1), chest pain (f2), and other numerical features like trestbps (f4), chol (f5), etc.

2. **Useful Interactions and Ratios**: Include interactions like ratio of chest pain over age `[f4 f3 /]` and trestbps over restecg `[f4 f7 /]`.

3. **Non-linear Transformations**: Introduce non-linear transformations such as `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `sqrt` which can help in making relationships more linear if they inherently follow a non-linear pattern. For example, sigmoid applied to age, sex, and a few others.

4. **Logarithmic and Reciprocal Transformations**: Use transformations like `log` and `reciprocal` for attributes like `thalach` and `oldpeak` which can reduce skewness and handle large value ranges effectively.

5. **Combinations**: Incorporate feature combinations and adjustments such as `[f4 sqrt f7 +]` which adds derived square-rooted values in a linear fashion. Also include `[f8 f9 *]` which multiplies `exang` and age, potentially capturing complex interactions.

These features together offer a robust set that likely captures both linear and non-linear relationships, while also addressing potential issues in scaling and value distribution. They should facilitate better predictions for the presence of heart disease.

2026-01-19 19:44:36,384 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature set examples, let's construct a new and potentially better feature set by combining and improving upon the transformations. In feature engineering, it's often beneficial to use combinations of transformations that can capture non-linear relationships and normalize or scale the features appropriately.

Here's a proposed feature set based on combining transformations and drawing insights from the two examples:

1. Use of various transformations like division, quantile transformation, and sigmoid to normalize and capture non-linear patterns.
2. Inclusion of multi-step transformations to capture complex patterns.

New feature set:

```
[f9 sigmoid, f10 quan_trans sigmoid, f8 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid, f9 f7 / sigmoid, f10 f3 / sigmoid, f8 quan_trans sigmoid, f8 f3 / sigmoid, f10 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid, f9 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid, f9 f7 / quan_trans sigmoid, f10 quan_trans quan_trans, f8 f7 / quan_trans sigmoid, f6 f8 + f9 f3 / + f10 quan_trans sigmoid +, f6 f8 + f9 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid +, f6 f8 + f10 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid +, f6 f8 + f8 quan_trans sigmoid +, f6 f8 + f9 quan_trans sigmoid +]
```

This feature set focuses on:
- Capturing interaction effects with addition and division.
- Utilizing non-linear transformations like quantile transformation and sigmoid to manage outliers and non-linear relationships.
- Including previously seen successful transformations with new combinations to enhance feature representation.

For a potentially better feature set, let's incorporate diverse operations that can introduce non-linearities and normalization, while avoiding overly complex chains of transformations that might lead to overfitting or computational inefficiency. Here's a proposal:

```
[f2, f4, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10,

```

In this feature set:
- Basic numerical and categorical features are kept.
- Non-linear transformations like sine, cosine, and cube are used for introducing complex patterns.
- Scaling (minmax and sigmoid) is included for normalization and compressing feature space.
- The inclusion of arithmetic operations (`f4 f7 *`, `f4 f7 /`) allows interactions between features, potentially capturing joint effects.
- Multiple complex interactions (like `f8 sin sin cube`, `f8 sin sin cos`) add non-linearity without excessive repetition.

2026-01-19 19:45:02,000 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST  "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2026-01-19 19:45:02,003 - INFO - llm output = Let's analyze the provided feature set transformation examples and build on them to generate a potentially useful new feature:

### Given Examples:
1. **Example 1:** 
   ```plaintext
   [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f0 cos, f1 cos, f2 cos, f5 cos, f6 cos, f8 cos, f9 cos, f10 cos, f11 cos, f12 cos, f3 cos, f7 cos]
   ```
   This example suggests using the cosine transformation of each feature as an additional feature.

2. **Example 2:**
   ```plaintext
   [f8 f9 *]
   ```
   This example creates a new feature by multiplying features \( f8 \) and \( f9 \).

### New Feature Set Proposal:
We aim to create a new feature that captures a complex relationship between multiple features. Let's incorporate transformations and interactions suggestive of non-linear relationships:

- **Selection of Transformations:** Consider non-linear transformations that can capture interactions or create new interpretations of the existing data. Combining transformations often helps in revealing underlying patterns.
  
- **Choice of Interactions:** Based on the examples, consider combining transformations like the cosine with products or sums of features.

### New Feature Proposal:
```plaintext
[f4 f6 + f11 * f2 sqrt]
```

**Explanation:**
- **\[f4 f6 +\]:** Adds features \( f4 \) and \( f6 \). These could potentially measure related aspects and augment interpretability.
- **\[f11 *\]:** Multiplies the result by feature \( f11 \), which could control for the influence of an additional feature.
- **\[f2 sqrt\]:** Takes the square root of feature \( f2 \), which can help in normalizing or stabilizing variance.

These transformations can play a crucial role in revealing interactions and non-linear relationships that are otherwise not apparent in the original feature set.

I'll selectively combine transformations that capture important details about the features and relationships between them.

Here's a refined and potentially more effective feature set leveraging the examples provided:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f3 sqrt, f4 sqrt, f7 square, f8 f9 *, f0 tanh, f3 reciprocal, f5 sigmoid, f9 log, f7 tanh f10 -, f1 f2 /, f4 f7 /, f4 f3 /, f4 sqrt f7 +, f0 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f11 sigmoid, f12 sigmoid, f9 f10 /, f3 cos f8 +, f1 f4 *, f3 reciprocal f5 *]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Original Features**: We retain a variety of original features (e.g., f0, f1, …, f9) to ensure all initial data attributes are considered.

2. **Basic Transformations**:
   - **Sigmoid**: Applied to binary/categorical data (e.g., f5, f0) to map values between 0 and 1, which can be useful for logistic regression models.
   - **Tanh and Log**: Capture non-linear relationships akin to standard scaling and log transformation for stabilization.
   - **Square and Square Root**: Enhance or diminish the numerical influence, where square suggests non-linear up-scaling and sqrt is commonly used for reducing skew.

3. **Combinations/Interactions**:
   - **f4 sqrt f7 +**: Sums resting blood pressure (possibly high impact on health) with maximum heart rate adjusted, emphasizing their joint effect.
   - **f8 f9 ***: Interaction between exercise induced angina and oldpeak specifically captures relationships tied to stress and heart performance.
   - **f1 f2 /**: The division between sex (binary) and chest_pain shows relative incidence, helpful for categorical binary encoding.
   - **f3 reciprocal**: Addresses how a small normal restecg could relate intricately with trestbps.
   - **f9 f10 /**: Ratio representing the effect of oldpeak adjusted for reciprocal scaling from the slope feature gives scope of variance.

4. **Tailored Feature Derivation**:
   - **f3 cos f8 +**: Integrated metric smoothing cosine into chest pain types against f8, capturing cyclical cardiovascular behavior.
   - **f1 f4 ***: Product of sex and trestbps leveraging gender differences in cardiovascular responses.

This new feature set aims to provide both breadth (by covering individual features and transformations) and depth (through careful construction of interaction terms) within the processed data that could better capture complex relations beneficial for heart disease prediction accuracy.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Transformations**: Include original features to maintain baseline information.
2. **Cosine Transformations**: Cosine transformations can help in scenarios where periodicity might play a role.
3. **Square Root Transformations**: Square root transformations can reduce skewness and stabilize variance for features with higher values.
4. **Log Transformation**: Often used to handle positive-skewed features. Applied here to `f0` and `f3` as age and trestbps can be skewed.
5. **Min-Max Scaling**: Normalize the range of specific features to [0,1]. Applied to `f7` (thalach) and `f8` (exang) as they often benefit from normalization.
6. **Interaction terms**: Showcasing possible interactions between pairs of features which might capture non-linear relationships between them.

Each transformation and additional feature is designed to harness more predictive power from the original features by addressing potential issues such as non-linearity, high variance, or interactions that aren't captured by the original feature set.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's an improved feature set that leverages the transformations used in the examples while potentially exploring new combinations designed to enhance predictive power:

```

### Explanation:

1. **Preserving Raw Features**: The base numerical and categorical features (f0, f1, f2, f4, etc.) are preserved as they can be significant on their own.

2. **Combining Elements from Both Sets**: The new features leverage transformations such as sigmoid and quan_trans, used in conjunction with multiplication/division with other features to capture interactions.

3. **Feature Interactions**: Some features are created by interacting original features (multiplying/dividing them) before applying transformations, which can capture non-linear relationships.

4. **Complex Constructs**: Combinations of multiple features and transformations in a single feature (e.g., `f6 f8 + f9 f3 / + f10 quan_trans sigmoid +`) are designed to capture higher-order interactions which might be necessary for improved prediction of heart disease.

This resulted feature set should offer richer representations to the model, capturing both non-linear transformations and interactions among the original features.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```plaintext
[f10 quan_trans quan_trans, f8 f9 / quan_trans sigmoid, f8 f7 / sigmoid, f10 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, f10 quan_trans, f2 f3 / quan_trans, f10 f3 / quan_trans, f9 f3 / sigmoid, f8 f9 / sigmoid, f8 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid, f8 quan_trans sigmoid, f9 quan_trans sigmoid, f9 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid, f9 f7 / quan_trans sigmoid, f8 f3 / tanh, f8 f7 / minmax_scaler, f9 f3 / minmax_scaler, f10 sqrt, f2 minmax_scaler, f2 f3 / minmax_scaler, f8 f7 / quan_trans sqrt, f10 sigmod, f7 q1]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Advanced Feature Transformations**:
   - **Quantile Transformation**: Used multiple times for scaling features to follow a uniform distribution, potentially improving linear model performance.
   
2. **Distribution Transformations**:
   - **Sigmoid and Tanh**: Applied on several features to bring values between -1 and 1 (Tanh) or between 0 and 1 (Sigmoid). This can be particularly effective in reducing the impact of outliers.
   
3. **Scaling Techniques**:
   - **Min-Max Scaling**: Applied on ratios to ensure values feed well into algorithms that are sensitive to input magnitudes.
   
4. **Combination of Ratios and Original Features**:
   - Ratios like `f8 f9 /` and individual features provide a mixed feature space that captures different data aspects.

5. **Single Feature Transformations**:
   - Using simple transformations like square, square root, and reciprocal to further enhance feature behavior.

Collectively, these transformed features are structured to capture non-linear relationships and balance feature proportions, thus enriching the predictive capability of the model designed for heart disease prediction.

Key Highlights:

1. **Logarithmic and Reciprocal Transformations**: Applied on features such as blood pressure and cholesterol to manage skewness and capture multiplicative effects.
   
2. **Trigonometric Functions**: Sin, and tanh functions can model cyclic trends or boundaries within the data, potentially capturing underlying patterns.

3. **Product and Difference of Features**: Using multiplications and subtractions between relevant features (e.g., resting blood pressure and maximum heart rate) might reveal interaction effects indicative of heart disease.

4. **Scaling & Normalization**: Min-max and standard scaling to standardize features, which is vital for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.

5. **Square Root Transformations**: Applied to blood pressure and ST depression differences to reduce skewness while preserving order.

By exploring combinations and non-linear transformations in this way, we aim to enhance the model's ability to detect the presence of heart disease more accurately.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Explanation of selected transformations:
1. **Log Transformation**: Applied to features like `f3` and `f4` to reduce skewness for normally distributed transformations.
2. **Trigonometric Transformations**: Used with `sin` and `cos`, possibly extracting periodic patterns from time-related or cyclic features.
3. **Scaler Transformations**: Both `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` help bring features to similar scales and normalize them.
4. **Combinations of Arithmetic and Transformation Operations**: Such as `/, +, -` combined with `tanh, sqrt` incorporate complex interactions yielding potentially richer features.
5. **Derived Feature Interactions**: For example, `f3 f9 + tanh` explores interactions enhanced by activation-like functions (`tanh`).

This feature set is designed to balance between transformations for normalization, pattern extraction, and complex interactions maximization to uncover more informative features from the original dataset. This setup aims to enhance the model's ability to capture underlying patterns that might predict the target variable, `heart disease`, more robustly.

```

### Key Enhancements:
- **Logarithmic and Power Transformations**: Applying log transformations selectively on features (e.g., `f0 log`, `f4 log`) to handle skewness, while square and square root transformations can help manage outlier effects (`f3 square`, `f3 sqrt`).
- **Interaction Features**: Combining original features (e.g., `f0 f3 *`, `f5 f7 *`) to explore multiplicative effects while considering differences and ratios can expose relational dynamics (`f7 f11 -`, `f8 f9 /`).
- **Activation Functions**: Using `tanh` and `reciprocal` to potentially normalize and introduce non-linear characteristics (`f3 f10 tanh`, `f4 f10 tanh`, `f8 reciprocal`).
- **Normalization/Scaling**: Standard scaling (`stand_scaler`) and min-max scaling provide normalization to adjust feature scales harmoniously (`f7 stand_scaler`, `f12 minmax_scaler`).
- **Combined Feature Aggregation**: Aggregating transformed features to identify potential synergies (e.g., `f3 f12 +`, `f3 f5 /`, `f9 f7 -`).

This feature set expands classical transformations, while integrating statistical techniques that could unveil predictive relationships, and the balance of original, transformed, and interaction features aims to improve the prediction task outcome for heart disease presence.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here is an improved feature set:

```

### Explanation:

1. **Combination of Scaling and Transformation**: Using `quan_trans` and `sigmoid` in combination can often highlight the non-linear relationships and ensure that the transformed features are distributed in a way that's beneficial for learning models. The combination of `quan_trans` and `sigmoid` is utilized in multiple features.

2. **Reciprocal and Logarithmic Transformations**: These are effective for reducing skewness and handling features that might be expected to have exponential relationships with the outcome (e.g., `f3 reciprocal`, `f9 log`).

3. **Feature Interaction**: Multiplications (`f8 f9 *`, `f1 f4 *`) capture interactions between features, assuming non-additive relationships contribute information that's predictive.

4. **Non-linear transformations**: Applying functions such as `tanh`, `sigmoid`, which can handle non-linear relationships.

5. **Statistical Feature Transformations**: Using operations like `sqrt` and `square` helps to create variations in scale and variance (`f3 sqrt`, `f4 sqrt`, `f7 square`).

By integrating these feature transformations, we aim to enhance model performance by capturing both linear and complex non-linear relationships inherent in the data.

2026-01-19 19:47:07,228 - INFO - llm output = Feature engineering often plays a crucial role in improving model performance, especially when it comes to handling complex datasets with multiple types of variables. Based on the given examples, here is a new, improved feature set. The aim is to introduce transformative operations that can uncover underlying patterns and relationships while retaining all original features for completeness:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12,
 f0 square, f1 sin, f2 cos, 
 f3 log, f4 log, f3 f4 /, f5 square, 
 f6 sigmoid, f7 square, f8 cos, f9 sqrt, f10 tanh, f11 minmax_scaler, f12 sigmoid, 
 f3 f9 /, f4 f5 *, f0 f11 -, f8 f10 /, f7 f12 -,
 f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, 
 f4 sqrt, f8 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, 
 f3 f10 +, f4 f12 -, 
 f3 oldpeak square /, f0 thal_sqrt +, 
 f6 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal]
```

**Rationale:**
1. **Log and Sqrt Transformations**: Useful for normalizing skewed data distributions. Applied to `f3`, `f4`, `f9`, etc.
2. **Square and Cos Transformations**: Capture potential non-linear relationships and periodic trends, respectively.
3. **Sigmoid Transformation**: Compresses input into the range (0, 1), potentially useful for probabilities or normalized scaling.
4. **Stand and Minmax Scaling**: Helps to standardize the features, which is beneficial for some algorithms.
5. **New Combinations**: Unique feature interactions such as `f3 oldpeak square / `, `f0 thal_sqrt +`, which might reveal hidden relationships.
6. **Reciprocal Transformations**: Alleviate effects of large outliers.
7. **Feature Differences**: Differences (`f3 f9 /`) sometimes reveal contrasts or changes more effectively than absolute values in isolating hidden patterns.

This set continues to refine feature complexity, integrate interaction terms, and diversify transformations to explore unknown relationships within the data, with the goal of improving prediction reliability for the presence of heart disease.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Explanation for some transformations:
- `f0 f3 +` and `f1 f4 +`: Create interactions between age/resting blood pressure and sex/cholesterol.
- `f0 f4 /` and `f3 f9 /`: Derive ratios that might capture relative health status.
- `f7 f12 -`: Incorporate the difference between maximum heart rate and thal defects.
- Trigonometric (cosine) and nonlinear (tanh, sqrt) transformations enrich the feature set with nonlinear relationships.
- `stand_scaler`, `log`, and `sqrt` are good for normalizing and transforming skewed distributions.

These transformations could help capture complex relationships between features and improve the model's ability to accurately predict heart disease presence.

### Explanation:

1. **Standard Scaling & Min-Max Scaling**: Applied to key features to stabilize variance and adjust scales, notably improving model convergence.

2. **Trigonometric Functions**: Utilizing `sin` and `cos`, especially after scaling operations, can introduce non-linear relationships often present in physiological data.

3. **Log and Square Root Transformations**: Applied to features with likely distribution skewness to approach normality.

4. **Ratio & Difference Operations**: Derived meaningful features through ratio (e.g., `f3 f9 /`) and difference (e.g., `f0 f11 -`) operations capturing relationships between features.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: By focusing on combinations expected to enhance model interpretability and predictive power based on physiological intuition and standard practices in feature engineering.

2026-01-19 19:48:21,143 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, I will create a new feature set that incorporates the strengths of both while aiming for a potentially more insightful and useful transformation of the original data.

Features from the first set show various scaling methods combined with trigonometric transformations, which can be useful for normalizing data and potentially finding non-linear patterns. The use of normalizing techniques along with reciprocal transformations in the second set can help highlight inverse relationships. Furthermore, the sigmoid and quantile transforms in the second set are particularly useful for handling outliers and skewed distributions.

Here's a new feature set that tries to blend these considerations:

```
[f8 minmax_scaler sin stand_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler sin stand_scaler reciprocal, f8 sin minmax_scaler minmax_scaler stand_scaler, f9 f7 / sigmoid, f10 quan_trans minmax_scaler, f8 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid, f10 f3 / quan_trans sigmoid, f9 quan_trans sigmoid, f10 f3 / quantile_transform minmax_scaler, f9 f3 / sigmoid, f10 quan_trans quan_trans, f10 f3 / reciprocal minmax_scaler, f8 f7 / sigmoid stand_scaler, f9 f7 / quan_trans sigmoid minmax_scaler]
```

Explanation for some of the choices:
- Combining scaling and transformation functions across different features (e.g., `f8 minmax_scaler sin stand_scaler`) helps to normalize and potentially unveil hidden periodic or cyclic patterns.
- Using reciprocal transformations (`f10 minmax_scaler sin stand_scaler reciprocal`) helps to explore inverse relationships.
- The use of `quantile_transform` with `minmax_scaler` deals with non-Gaussian distributions and can reveal patterns not previously visible (`f10 quan_trans minmax_scaler`).
- Applying `sigmoid` after `quan_trans` can further control the influence of outliers, ideally making the model more robust to these extreme values.

[f0 log , f4 log , f9 tanh , f3 f9 + tanh , f7 f12 - sqrt , f0 cos minmax_scaler , f1 cos stand_scaler , f3 log minmax_scaler , f3 f4 / minmax_scaler , f9 sqrt stand_scaler , f9 tanh minmax_scaler , f2 stand_scaler minmax_scaler tanh , f8 cos stand_scaler tanh , f11 tanh minmax_scaler , f8 minmax_scaler sin stand_scaler , f8 f10 * sin , f2 stand_scaler minmax_scaler cos , f9 reciprocal stand_scaler , f7 log tanh minmax_scaler , f12 tanh cos]
```

**Explanations for key choices:**
- **Log Transformation (`log`)**: Useful for normally distributed features to reduce skewness, applied to features like `f0`, `f3`, and `f4`.
- **Trigonometric Functions (`cos`, `sin`)**: Useful for non-linear transformations, they can capture periodic patterns, used on features like `f8` and `f10`.
- **Hyperbolic Tangent (`tanh`)**: Useful for scaling features to a range of [-1, 1], applied on `f9`, `f11`, and `f12`.
- **Normalizations and Standardizations (`minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`)**: Scale features to fall within a specific range or to have mean zero and unit variance, aiding in model convergence.
- **Reciprocal Transformation (`reciprocal`)**: Used on positively skewed data to reduce skewness, applied on `f9`.
- **Combination Features**: We combine features such as `f7 f12 -` and use non-linear transformations to capture complex interactions.

The design of the feature set aims to enhance the model's ability to uncover intricate patterns and relationships in the data, crucial for improved cardiovascular risk prediction.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 19:48:53,942 - INFO - llm output = Creating a better feature set involves selecting informative transformations that capture meaningful patterns and correlations in the data, leveraging non-linear transformations, interactions, and scaling. Here's an improved feature set based on the given examples:

```

Additional details:
- This set combines the non-linear transformations and feature interactions from both previous sets with new operations that could capture additional linear and non-linear relationships.
- Consideration has been given to potential multicollinearity by including both individual and combined transformations where useful. 
- Normalization techniques, such as `minmax_scaler` and `sigmoid`, are used to help certain features fit within a standardized range.
- The combination of transformations aims to enhance both linear and non-linear model capabilities.
