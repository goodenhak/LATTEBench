you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's an enhanced feature set that encompasses both foundational and complex transformations:

```plaintext

```

In this version, I've:

1. Kept the crucial original features.
2. Added basic interactions like `f0 f3 *` and `f4 f5 *` to capture interaction effects.
3. Applied `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` on several features to accommodate different scaling perspectives.
4. Introduced non-linear transformations such as `tanh`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and `cube` to capture complex relationships.
5. Added trigonometric functions `sin` and `cos` for periodic patterns, which can be especially useful for time-related features.
6. retained combinations of features that might represent significant interactions across different dimensions. 

This set provides a broad view of interactions and transformations while ensuring comprehensive coverage of different feature generation techniques.

2026-01-19 21:56:44,320 - INFO - llm output = Creating a better feature set typically involves considering both interpretability and the ability to capture complex patterns in the data. In this case, the second feature set is more complex and potentially more informative due to the extensive use of polynomial combinations and transformations, but it might be harder to interpret. A better feature set might involve balancing complexity with the ability to generalize well.

Let's create a combined feature set that captures complex interactions while ensuring it doesn't become too computationally intensive or hard to interpret. Here are some suggestions:

1. Retain useful simple transformations like `f3 cube` and `f5 f4 f6 +` from the more complex example to capture interaction effects.
2. Combine simpler transformation approaches with intuitive mathematical operations, ensuring easier interpretability and computational efficiency.

Here's a proposal for a refined feature set:

```

This feature set attempts to capture:

- Basic interactions through `f5 f4 f6 +` and `f5 f6 f4 + +`.
- Higher-order interactions via cubes with `f3 cube` and `f3 f5 f6 + cube`.
- More complex combinations while still ensuring that they remain manageable and interpretable.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 21:57:53,868 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, a better feature set combines useful transformations from both examples and incorporates a more diverse range of operations. This kind of feature set can help improve model predictions by capturing different aspects of the data through various transformations. The following feature set is constructed by considering these factors:

```
[f0 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f0 f3 * ,f0 f5 * ,f0 f6 * ,f2 f3 * ,f3 f4 * ,f3 f6 * ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f0 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f3 tanh ,f5 tanh ,f6 tanh ,f3 log ,f3 reciprocal ,f3 cube ,f3 sqrt ,f0 sin ,f2 cos ,f4 sin ,f6 cos ,f5 sigmoid ,f2 f3 + ,f2 f4 - ,f3 f6 /]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Basic Features**: Retained some original features to provide context.
2. **Multiplicative Interactions**: Included interactions between fundamental features to capture combined effects.
3. **Scalings and Normalizations**: Used normalizations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to standardize features.
4. **Nonlinear Transformations**: Included transformations like `log`, `tanh`, `reciprocal`, and `cube` to capture nonlinear relationships.
5. **Trigonometric and Sigmoidal Functions**: Added to capture cyclical patterns and compress features within specific bounds.
6. **Additions and Subtractions**: Added new interactions that could capture differences or combined scales between features.
7. **Divisions**: Introduced divisions for potential rate calculations.

This set combines various transformations with interaction terms, providing a robust set of features for potentially improved predictive capability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- We use standard scaling for some original features, as shown in the second example.
- We combine some basic arithmetic operations with scaled features to enrich the feature space, inspired by the complex combinations in the first example.
- New interactions between scaled and non-scaled features are introduced to better explore potential non-linear relationships.

```

Changes and additions:
1. **Increased Cross-feature Interaction**: Combined complementary features to derive new potential interactions (e.g., `f2 f3 * f6 +`).
2. **Enhanced Transformation Diversity**: Applied non-linear transformations like `sin` and `cos` across multi-feature interactions (e.g., `f0 sin f3 *`).
3. **Blended Approaches**: Balanced between base transformations (like `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`) and complex interactions to capture different data scales and non-linearities (e.g., `f2 f3 * f6 +` and `f0 f3 + f3 + sin f5 *`).

These changes make the feature set robust for learning richer patterns potentially leading to improved model performance.

2026-01-19 22:01:15,019 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and operations, the goal is to create a feature set with transformations that might capture important patterns or relationships in the data more effectively. The second example employs feature standardization, operations like square, multiplication, and reciprocals, which might be more informative than simple cube transformations. I'll create a new feature set that builds on these ideas and incorporates additional transformations for potential improvement:

``` 
[f0 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f0 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f5 stand_scaler ,f6 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler square ,f4 stand_scaler square ,f5 stand_scaler square ,f3 stand_scaler f4 stand_scaler * ,f5 stand_scaler f6 stand_scaler * ,f3 stand_scaler reciprocal ,f4 stand_scaler reciprocal ,f5 stand_scaler reciprocal f6 stand_scaler + ,f5 stand_scaler sqrt ,f6 stand_scaler sqrt f3 stand_scaler f5 stand_scaler *]
```

In this feature set:
- Features are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance, which can help improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms.
- Square, multiplication, and reciprocal transformations are used to capture non-linear relationships.
- A square root transformation is added to further explore non-linear patterns.

Given the transformations in the examples (min-max scaling and tanh transformation), we should consider both normalization and nonlinear transformations to capture different aspects of the data distribution.

Here's an improved feature set using a combination of transformations including scaling, nonlinear transformation, and basic arithmetic operations:

```

### Explanation:
1. **Original and Tanh Transformed Features:** Retaining both the original features and their tanh transformations helps in capturing the nonlinearities in the data.
2. **Further Nonlinear Transformations:** Applying the tanh transformation twice to some features, potentially enhances the ability to capture nuanced behaviors in the data.
3. **Min-Max Scaling:** It is beneficial to keep features normalized to ensure no single feature overly influences the model due to scale differences.
4. **Basic Arithmetic:** Combining features using addition and multiplication can capture potential interactions between features.
5. **Arithmetic Differences:** Subtraction aims to capture differences in related features, which could be useful for identifying relative changes between them.

These transformations and combinations allow for capturing both the linear and nonlinear relationships within the dataset, potentially improving the machine learning model's performance in predicting the price changes.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 22:03:04,388 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for downstream tasks such as prediction, it's important to combine transformations that offer meaningful variations and patterns while potentially reducing noise. Here is a better feature set combining elements from the two given sets: 

- Start with the basic features: [f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7] (including more base features considering f7 from the second example).
- Apply transformations and interactions that can potentiate the feature space:
  
\[ 
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f0 f3 *, f0 f5 *, f2 f3 *, f3 f4 *, f3 f6 *, f0 minmax\_scaler, f2 minmax\_scaler, f3 minmax\_scaler, f4 minmax\_scaler, f5 minmax\_scaler, f6 minmax\_scaler, f3 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f3 log, f3 reciprocal, f3 cube, f2 f3 *, f0 f6 *, f4 f5 *, f6 f7 *, f0 sin, f2 cos ,f4 sin ,f6 cos, f1 tanh, f1 tanh log, f3 tanh tanh, f5 tanh tanh, f1 f7 * ]
\] 

### Explanation:
- **Retain Core Features:** Maintain all initial features and add f7 from the second example.
- **New Interactions:** Include multiplication interactions between different variables, such as `f1 f7 *`, a potentially informative interaction reflecting complex relationships.
- **Transformation Layers:**
  - Use of `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, `log`, and `reciprocal` address feature scaling and normalization, complementing more balanced model training and improving interpretability.
  - Use `tanh tanh` for interesting non-linear transformations that may smooth complex relationships.
- **Trig and Periodic Transformations:** Apply trigonometric functions like `sin` and `cos` to induce periodic components, which can be useful for capturing cyclical patterns.

This proposed feature set intends to strike a balance between linear and non-linear feature interactions, feature scaling, and the inclusion of complex transformations appropriate for enhancing predictive model performance.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Explanation:
- Retained the basic features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5`, `f6`, `f7`) for essential raw data representation.
- Included simple transformations and feature interactions (`f1 square`, `f1 square sin`, `f3 f4 +`, `f3 f1 tanh`).
- Applied standard scaling and additional informative transformations to some features to normalize and extract non-linear relationships (`f0 stand_scaler`, `f3 stand_scaler`, `f1 square sin stand_scaler`).
- Added interactions between certain features using operations like multiplication, division, tanh, and logarithm to capture complex relationships and potential predictive power (`f5 stand_scaler square`, `f6 f7 *`, `f2 f6 * tanh`, `f5 f3 / log`, `f5 f7 +`, `f4 f3 * sqrt`).

This new set combines basic, transformed, and interaction features with a variety of mathematical operations, enhancing the model's ability to learn from complex data patterns.

The advancements include adding higher-order interactions such as `f3 f4 f5 * *`, which captures the interaction between three features, and the same for others. Additionally, the inclusion of functions like `sqrt`, `sigmoid` provides different perspectives on the features, which might help capture non-linear relationships in the data.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f0 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f1 square, f1 square sin stand_scaler, f0 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler square, f3 cube stand_scaler, f4 cube stand_scaler]

2026-01-19 22:06:28,454 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformation examples, the goal is to generate a better new feature set. The second feature set example is simpler while maintaining complex transformations like cubes. The first example introduces standardized features and combinations of transformations like scaling and squaring, which can help in capturing different data distributions and variations.

To create a better feature set, we can incorporate some of these transformations to capture more complex relationships while still keeping some simplicity. Here's a proposed set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f0 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, 
f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f1 square, f0 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, 
f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, 
f5 stand_scaler square, f1 square sin minmax_scaler]
```

In this set:
- We've retained the original features (`f0` to `f7`).
- We include cube transformations of all features to capture non-linear relationships.
- Additionally, square and standard scaling transformations are included to handle varied aspect scales.
- A combination transformation `f1 square sin minmax_scaler` is introduced to enhance complexity capturing capabilities, as sin and min-max scalings can help in smoothing and normalizing diverse data ranges.

```

In this feature set:
- We kept the essential original features and some combined feature transformations from both examples.
- Retained scaling and non-linear transformations (like tanh and sigmoid) that could capture underlying patterns.
- Added new combinations and transformations like `f3 f4 +`, `f2 log`, and `f6 sqrt` to enhance the diversity of interactions and potential non-linear relationships that the model can learn.
- Included statistical transformations, such as square roots and logs, on some features to help with variance stabilization and to potentially uncover multiplicative relationships.
- Applied standard and min-max scaling on less represented features to account for range issues and potential outliers.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 22:09:18,374 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, the first set explores the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) and logarithmic transformations, while the second set primarily involves min-max scaling and repeated min-max transformations. To create a better feature set, we can combine the strengths of these approaches by including both the nonlinear transformations (e.g., tanh, log) and scaling techniques. This will allow us to capture both non-linear relationships and ensure that feature values are aligned in a range suitable for most models.

Here is an improved feature set combining ideas from both examples:

```
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f4 tanh, f5 tanh, f6 tanh, f0 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f1 tanh log, f3 tanh log]
```

In the improved set:
- The inclusion of `f0`, `f3`, `f5`, `f6`, and `f7` is preserved for initial transformations.
- Nonlinear transformations like `tanh` applied to `f1`, `f2`, `f4`, `f5`, and `f6` capture nonlinear relationships.
- `minmax_scaler` is applied to `f0`, `f3`, `f5`, and `f7` to normalize these features.
- Logarithmic transformations of tanh-transformed values for `f1` and `f3` introduce further non-linearity and variation.

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f0 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, f0 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f1 square, f4 sqrt, f5 log, f6 reciprocal, f3 tanh, f1 square sin minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:

1. Retained Cubes: Retained cube transformations for all relevant features as they can help capture non-linear relationships.
2. Standard Scaler: Retained this transformation to reduce feature scaling discrepancies for `f0`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5`, and `f6`.
3. Introduced Sqrt: Added `f4 sqrt` to manage skewness.
4. Log Transformation: Added `f5 log` to handle skewness and promote normality.
5. Reciprocal: Added `f6 reciprocal` to help with highly skewed data, stabilizing variance.
6. Hyperbolic Tangent: Included `f3 tanh` to potentially limit the impact of extreme values.
7. Retained Sin of Square with Min-Max Scaler: Maintained the scaled sinusoidal transformation to emphasize cyclical patterns. 

This feature set attempts to balance complexity and dimensionality by keeping potentially highly informative transformations while controlling feature magnitudes and distribution shapes.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /).

This approach might enhance the model's ability to predict the label accurately. Below is an improved feature set based on the given examples.

In this enhanced feature set, I've ensured that redundant expressions are minimized while incorporating a variety of transformations to capture different aspects of the data. I've added combinations like `f4 f5 *`, which might capture interactions between different features, and incorporated additional log and reciprocal transformations for various features to uncover non-linear relationships.

2026-01-19 22:12:25,191 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, let's create a new feature set that captures potentially useful interactions between the original features while taking advantage of some of the feature engineering techniques mentioned:

1. Use basic interactions and potential non-linear transformations (like cube) from the suggested sets, focusing on combinations that might expose relationships related to the electricity price and demand.

2. Combine these with some arithmetic operations that reflect realistic and interpretable scenarios, ensuring to capture interaction terms that involve time (or cyclic features) which might relate to daily/periodic fluctuations (e.g., features involving `day` and `period`).

Here's a proposed feature set based on the examples given:

```plaintext
[f3 ,f5 ,f0 f1 + ,f1 f2 + ,f1 f5 + f6 + ,f3 cube f5 * ,f2 f6 + f7 + ,f0 f3 + f5 cube ,f5 f7 + ,f1 f3 + f2 cube ,f1 f4 + f7 + ,f2 f7 + f3 + ,f1 f3 * f6 + ,f0 f3 + f2 + f7 * ,f1 f6 + f5 + ,f2 f4 + f3 cube]
```

This feature set:
- Maintains combinations of the basic set (like `f3` and `f5`) which are potentially indicative of price and demand interactions.
- Incorporates polynomial transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Uses combinations that include `f0` (date) and `f1` (day) as they are cyclic/temporal features, potentially useful in a time series prediction problem.
- Measures interactions involving electricity prices and demand which are critical for the task of predicting electricity price changes.

2026-01-19 22:13:55,316 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations, the goal is to derive a better feature set by combining and extending the given transformations, maximizing its utility for predictive tasks.

To achieve this, let's combine the most beneficial aspects of both feature sets, focus on diversity in transformations, and ensure each original feature contributes to the new set in a meaningful way.

Here is an improved feature set:

```plaintext

```

In this improved feature set, I've included a balance of mathematical operations, scaling transformations, and nonlinear functions. Key improvements include:

1. **Variety of Basic Operations**: Used combinations of basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division among normalized and original features.
2. **Non-linear Transformations**: Incorporated non-linear transformations such as tanh and sin/cos, which can capture complex patterns in data.
3. **Statistical Scaling**: Applied both min-max scaling and standard scaling to normalized features, ensuring that features with different scales are comparable.
4. **Logarithm and Reciprocal**: These transformations help handle skewed distributions and highlight smaller variations.
5. **Compound Transformations**: Used composite transformations (e.g., `f3 tanh tanh`) to explore higher-order relationships. 

This balanced feature set aims to improve the downstream task by providing a diverse representation of the input variables, making it more adaptable to different predictive models.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 22:17:26,809 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two sets provided, the latter set introduces a broader range of transformations and scaling techniques which can potentially improve predictive performance by providing more diverse perspectives on the data. Building on that, here's an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, 
 f0 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube, 
 f0 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler,

 f3 square, f7 reciprocal, f4 log, f4 square, f6 stand_scaler, f0 cos, f2 sin, f3 tanh log]
```

Explanation of additions:
- Additional transformations offer different perspectives on the same data, potentially identifying nonlinear relationships.
- Incorporating `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` ensures features are centered and scaled, which is often crucial for many machine learning models.
- Functions like `cos`, `sin`, `tanh`, and `log` can help in capturing cyclic patterns or stabilizing variance.

This comprehensive set provides a richer feature space for a downstream predictive task, improving the chances of capturing the underlying patterns effectively.

2026-01-19 22:20:51,255 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two example feature sets you've provided, the task is to create a more informative feature set using transformation and combination techniques that could better capture underlying patterns in the data. 

The second feature set example includes all the original features from the first set, plus more transformations and interactions. I'll incorporate these ideas and aim to enhance the utility of derived features through additional transformations.

Here is the improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7,
 f0 f3 *, f0 f5 *, f0 f6 *, f2 f3 *, f3 f4 *, f3 f6 *, f0 f7 *, f1 f7 /, f3 f7 +,

 f5 f7 *, f1 f6 -, f6 f1 -]
```

**Explanation:**
- The feature set provides a mixture of original features, combined interactions, normalization/scaling, and nonlinear transformations to enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships.
- Including interactions like `f0 f7 *`, `f1 f6 -`, and `f6 f1 -` allows capturing inter-feature influences that could impact electricity price movements in unexpected ways.
- The non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sin`, `cos`, and `log` often help the model learn patterns nonlinearly.
- Further feature scaling with `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` may enhance model convergence and performance for certain types of algorithms.

Here is the new feature set:

3. Included nonlinear transformations such as `tanh`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, `sigmoid` to capture complex relationships.
4. Ensured diversity by using reciprocal and square root where possible to test potential nonlinear relationships.
5. Kept the usage of fundamental mathematical operations to maintain interpretability and potential use in linear models.

The new feature set should maintain the diversity of transformations and include interactions between features, while also introducing some new transformations that could capture more complex relationships.

Here is the improved feature set:

```

```

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Feature Interaction Enhancements**: I included a few more complex interactions such as `f0 f3 f4 * *` and `f0 f5 f6 * *`, which can capture interactions between multiple groups of features simultaneously.
- **Reduction of Redundancy**: Removed redundant features and kept diverse transformations to ensure variability.
- **New Transformations**: Introduced additional transformations like `f1 reciprocal` and `f3 square` to capture inverse relationships and non-linear quadratic effects.
- **Focus on Important Interactions**: Kept interactions like `f4 f5 *` and `f3 f6 *` from previous feature sets as they seem to potentially capture important relationships between electricity prices/demands.

This new feature set leverages both basic and advanced transformations, creating a rich pool of features for improving model predictions.

2026-01-19 22:25:40,006 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set for improved prediction and modeling, we can generate new features by leveraging transformations and combinations from the two given examples. The goal is to capture useful interactions and nonlinearities that could enhance the predictive power.

Here's a new feature set that takes inspiration from both examples, giving priority to meaningful transformations and combinations:
```
[f0, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f0 f3 *, f0 f5 *, f0 f6 *, f2 f3 *, f3 f4 *, f3 f6 *, f0 f7 *, f1 f7 /, f3 f7 +, f0 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler, f6 tanh, f3 log, f3 cube, f3 sqrt, f2 cos, f6 cos, f5 sigmoid, f2 f3 +, f2 f4 -, f3 f6 /, f5 f6 +, f5 f7 *, f2 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f5 tanh, f0 tanh, f0 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f5 log, f1 sqrt, f2 log, f1 f6 -, f6 f1 -]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Features**: The original features (f0 to f7) are included as they form the base of your dataset.

2. **Feature Interactions**: 
   - Products such as `f0 f3 *`, `f0 f5 *`, `f0 f6 *`, `f2 f3 *`, are maintained to capture interactions between different base features.
   - Addition and subtraction interactions like `f2 f3 +`, `f2 f4 -`, and `f3 f6 /` are retained since they can reveal linear relationships.

3. **Transformations**:
   - **Normalization and Scaling**: Using `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` helps in normalizing the data, ensuring that the models do not get biased by some of the inputs having larger ranges than others.
   - **Logarithmic and Reciprocals**: `log` and `reciprocal` are helpful in dealing with skewed distributions, like `f3 log` and `f5 log`.
   - **Non-linear Transformations**: Functions like `tanh`, `sin`, `cos`, `sigmoid` help in capturing non-linear relationships.

4. **Complex Transformations**:
   - Cube and square root transforms (`f3 cube`, `f3 sqrt`) to introduce non-linear relationships.

These new features were selected to balance non-linearity, interactions, and normalization, potentially capturing more subtle patterns in the dataset for the downstream prediction task.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7,  f0 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube,  f0 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler,  f1 square, f4 sqrt, f5 log, f6 reciprocal, f3 tanh, f1 square sin minmax_scaler, f3 square, f7 reciprocal, f4 log, f4 square, f6 stand_scaler, f0 cos, f2 sin, f3 tanh log] 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f0 cube ,f2 cube ,f3 cube ,f4 cube ,f5 cube ,f6 cube ,f7 cube]

2026-01-19 22:26:34,375 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set using the provided examples, we can combine elements from both while applying a variety of transformations to enrich the data representation. Here's a new feature set that builds on the previous examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7,
 f0 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f7 cube,
 f0 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 stand_scaler, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler,
 f1 square, f4 sqrt, f5 log, f6 reciprocal, f3 tanh,
 f1 square sin minmax_scaler, f3 square, f7 reciprocal, f4 log, f4 square, f6 stand_scaler,
 f0 cos, f2 sin, f3 tanh log,
 f2 sqrt, f5 reciprocal, f6 sin, f7 minmax_scaler, f0 tanh, f1 log, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 sin]
```

This new feature set includes:

1. Cubes of original features: Capturing non-linear relationships.
2. Standard scaling of features: Normalizing data to have mean 0 and variance 1, helping in models sensitive to feature scales.
3. Squares, square roots, and reciprocals: Exploring polynomial relationships and inverse relationships.
4. Logarithms: Reducing the effect of large values.
5. Trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations: Introducing periodicity and smoothing relationships.
6. Additional new transformations such as `f2 sqrt`, `f5 reciprocal`, and trigonometric functions like `f0 tanh`, `f1 log`, `f1 tanh`, `f2 tanh`, `f3 sin`, capturing different aspects of feature distribution and relationships.
