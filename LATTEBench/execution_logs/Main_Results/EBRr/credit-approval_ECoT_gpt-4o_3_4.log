Here's a proposal for a new feature set:

```
[f8, f14 f5 -, f14 f7 -, f14 f8 -, f14 f10 -, (f14 f5 -) sin, (f14 f7 -) cos, (f14 f8 - sigmoid) log, (f14 f9 - tanh) sqrt, (f14 f10 -) cube, (f8 tanh) (f14 f7 - sigmoid log sigmoid) * , (f14 f5 - sigmoid log) (f8 f14 * cube) /, (f14 f8 - sigmoid log sigmoid) (f14 f10 - sigmoid log sigmoid) *, (f14 f9 - sqrt) log (f14 f5 - cube) *, f14 sqrt, f14 square, f14 log, (f8 reciprocal) (f7 sigmoid log) +, (f14 f2 - sigmoid log sigmoid) (f9 cos) * ]
```

Key Features:
- Combination of differences (`f14 - fi`) with trigonometric transformations (`sin`, `cos`) to capture cyclic patterns.
- Use of `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and `log` functions on combinations to create non-linear transformations, which might help capture more complex patterns.
- Addition and multiplication of transformed features to model interactions between them.
- Selected feature transformations from both originals, focusing on those likely to provide the most variation or insight, such as `sqrt`, `cube`, and `reciprocal`.

This feature set incorporates both linear and non-linear transformations, aiming to capture a wide range of interactions and relationships within the data.

2026-01-17 16:41:21,875 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, both examples are using various statistical transformations and interactions between features to possibly capture non-linear relationships and increase predictive capability. 

Example 1 applies quantile transformation, min-max scaling, and tanh non-linear transformations along with subtraction interactions with f13, which could help with features that have extreme values or non-normal distributions.

Example 2 applies standard scaling, multiplications, and tanh transformations extensively, capturing more interactions between features which may help identify complex patterns.

When combining the qualities and practices from both examples, a more comprehensive feature set would take the advanced transformations and interactions from example 2 and integrate useful transformations like quantile transformations from example 1:

```plaintext

```

In this configuration, the interactions are maintained, while specific advantageous transformations like quantile transformation, square root transformation, and additional tanh applications are incorporated from the first example, potentially leading to improved model performance due to better feature representation.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f1 log ,f1 log log]

2026-01-17 16:41:27,515 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, it seems that the transformation process is intended to create a new set of features for better prediction by applying various transformation techniques. To improve upon the given examples, we can try incorporating diverse transformations that might capture the underlying patterns of the data better.

Here's an improved feature set using a broader range of transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, 
 f14 quan_trans, f14 sqrt, f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler,

 f7 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, 
 f11 minmax_scaler, f12 minmax_scaler, f14 quan_trans minmax_scaler, 
 f0 standard_scaler, f1 standard_scaler, f6 log, f7 reciprocal, 
 f13 sqrt, f8 square, f9 cube, f10 stand_scaler, f5 / f4, f1 + f2 * f9, 
 f3 - f11 tanh, f3 cos]
```

In this improved feature set:
- Standardization and scaling are applied to more features, which might help to normalize the range and distribution of values.
- A combination of logarithmic, reciprocal, and square root transformations are used on select features to address skewness or highlight nonlinear relationships.
- Arithmetic operations among features are employed to capture potential interactions or composite indicators.
- Additional trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations (cosine and tanh) are applied to explore cyclic patterns or exaggerated values.

This extended transformation approach aims to reveal additional data insights for a more accurate predictive model.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this transformation, I included several interactions, compositions, and scalings:
- Combine features using scaling techniques like `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans`
- Non-linear transformations like `cube` and `tanh` are applied to enhance complex correlations
- Use combinations of features with arithmetic operations followed by transformations to capture more intricate patterns in the data.

```plaintext
[f0 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f14 ,f13 minmax_scaler ,f2 f1 * ,f7 f1 * ,f8 f1 * ,f9 f1 * ,f10 f1 * ,f12 f1 * ,f13 minmax_scaler f1 * ,f1 f0 + ,f1 f5 + ,f1 f6 + ,f1 f7 + ,f1 f8 + ,f1 f10 + ,f1 f2 f1 * + ,f1 f5 f1 * + ,f1 f0 + log ,f1 f5 + log ,f1 f7 + log ,f1 f8 + log ,f1 f0 f1 * + log ,f1 f2 f1 * + log ,f1 f5 f1 * + log ,f2 f5 * sqrt ,f8 f9 * log ,f9 f3 * sqrt ,f0 f11 * cos ,f1 f4 * sin ,f10 f6 / sigmoid ,f12 f1 + sqrt minmax_scaler ,f14 reciprocal]
```

Explanation:
- `f2 f5 * sqrt`: Square root of the interaction between features corresponding to outstanding debt and marital status.
- `f8 f9 * log`: Log transform of the interaction between prior default and employed status, potentially capturing the impact of these combined statuses.
- `f9 f3 * sqrt`: Square root of the interaction between employed status and being married, capturing joint effects in a non-linear manner.
- `f0 f11 * cos`: Cosine transformation of the interaction between gender and driver's license, exploring cyclical patterns.
- `f1 f4 * sin`: Sine transformation of the interaction between age and bank customer status, capturing cyclical trends.
- `f10 f6 / sigmoid`: Sigmoid transform of the ratio between credit score and ethnicity, hypothesizing a bounded relationship.
- `f12 f1 + sqrt minmax_scaler`: Combination of citizenship and age, scaled to ensure consistent numerical impact.
- `f14 reciprocal`: Reciprocal transformation of income, mitigating highly skewed distributions.

Combining these transformations retains a diverse set of linear, non-linear, and interaction-based features to enhance the model's capability to capture intricate patterns in the data.

The second set uses scaling and multiplicative interactions which may capture relationships between features, while the first set includes additive combinations and feature engineering transformations like `quan_trans` and `tanh`.

Here's a new feature set example derived from both sets, incorporating scaling, transformations, and interactions:

```plaintext

```

In this feature set:
- Original features are included for baseline predictability.
- Key transforms include interactions like multiplication and combination with functions like `sqrt`, `log`, `tanh`, `quan_trans`, and others to initialize non-linear combinations.
- Scaling (`minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`) applied to adjust different feature scales.
- Usage of `quan_trans`, `reciprocal`, and others for more sophisticated transformations, leveraging both additive and multiplicative combinations where beneficial. These new features aim to capture complex, potentially non-linear relationships that may be beneficial for the predictive task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this enhanced feature set, we have added some interactions between features (e.g., `f6 f10 cube *`, `f5 square tanh f9 cos *`, `f0 f1 log * stand_scaler`), which can capture complex relationships in the data and improve the prediction accuracy. We also included transformations like `reciprocal` to bring out new insights from standalone features.

2026-01-17 16:42:14,433 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two sets of provided feature transformations, we can create an improved feature set that leverages advanced transformations to capture complex relationships in the data. We'll combine aspects of both previous sets to enhance the predictive power while introducing additional transformations that are likely to improve model performance.

Here's a proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f8 , f10 , f7 tanh , f8 minmax_scaler tanh , f10 minmax_scaler tanh , f13 f14 * , f13 f14 * stand_scaler , f10 tanh , f10 cube , f10 sigmoid log , f8 quan_trans tanh square , f7 f10 * square , f10 minmax_scaler tanh stand_scaler square , f6 stand_scaler , f8 stand_scaler , f1 log stand_scaler , f1 log log stand_scaler , f14 cos , f14 cos stand_scaler , f10 tanh cube , f9 stand_scaler , f10 cube stand_scaler , f8 minmax_scaler quan_trans tanh square , f7 minmax_scaler tanh stand_scaler f10 * tanh square , f10 tanh square cube]
```

### Rationale:
1. Retained strong nonlinear transformations like sigmoid, tanh, and square for capturing relationships.
2. Included combination transformations like `f13 f14 * stand_scaler` for interactions between features.
3. Emphasized important transformations such as those involving scaling (stand_scaler) and normalization (minmax_scaler).
4. Used repeated log transformations to address skewness in `f1`.
5. Introduced and compounded transformations like `tanh cube`, which could help in capturing more complex nonlinearities.
6. Incorporated a balance between standalone and compound transformations for robustness and flexibility.

This improved feature set should aid in better capturing the underlying patterns in the data related to successful credit card applications.

2. Interaction terms (`f1 f2 *`, `f7 f5 /`) combine characteristics, which might help in capturing underlying patterns. 
3. Transforms such as `sqrt`, `log`, and `reciprocal` can help in dealing with non-linearities.
4. `minmax_scaler` is used after calculations to keep transformed values on a similar scale.
5. Non-linear transformations such as `cos` and `tanh` provide alternative views of the data that can be helpful in capturing patterns not visible through linear transformations alone.

This feature set should provide a good balance of newly engineered and transformed features for improved downstream prediction tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Rationale**:
1. Replaced some `minmax_scaler` operations with `stand_scaler` to capture different normalization effects.
2. Combined features with potentially stronger interactions using math operations, like using `+`, `*`, and trigonometric transformations for capturing non-linear relationships.
3. Added new combinations involving log and square root to potentially capture interesting interactions.
4. Included expressions like `f0 f1 / log` and `f6 f8 + sqrt` to further explore joint feature effects and non-linearity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Used both quantile transformation and square root on `f14` to capture nonlinear patterns.
- Included interactions (`f13 f14 *`) and further transformed these interaction terms.
- Applied logarithmic transformation and normalization together to ensure numerical stability.
- Combined both min-max scaling and standard scaling based on prior examples to balance feature scaling.
- Additional transformations like reciprocal, cosine provide different perspectives on data dynamics.
- Ensured rich and non-linear transformations to potential insights without overfitting.

2026-01-17 16:42:59,674 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the two examples provided, let's look for a method that might capture more complex relationships while adding meaningful transformations to the original features. The first example employs the `minmax_scaler` on all features. The second example creates new features by adding the scaled `Income` to each of the other features (f0 through f12), which could help expose relationships influenced by income. 

Considering the transformations that have been applied and aiming to explore potentially powerful relationships between features, let's create a new feature set:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 
 f14 f1 + f2 * 
 f14 f3 + f4 - 
 f14 f5 / f6 * 
 f14 f7 cube 
 f14 sqrt 
 f13 reciprocal 
 f0 f8 * 
 f1 f9 * 
 f2 f10 * 
 f3 f11 * 
 f4 f12 *]
```

Here's a summary of what was done:
- Kept the original features (f0 through f14), as it is essential to maintain the original data points.
- Created interaction terms between `Income` (f14) and selected features to explore multiplicative relationships, potentially capturing compound effects (e.g., `f14 f1 + f2 *`, `f14 f5 / f6 *`).
- Utilized the `cube` transformation on the sum of `Income` and another feature for non-linear relationships.
- Added the `sqrt` transformation for the `Income` feature, which often helps in stabilizing variance.
- Included a `reciprocal` transformation on `Citizen`, capturing inverse effects.

Aiming for a more representative and potentially valuable feature set, I'll integrate both transformation techniques and relationships between features. Here's a new suggestion:

```

- I've retained some original transformations such as `minmax_scaler`, `quantile_transform`, and logarithmic transformations because they can be useful in scaling or normalizing data.
- I've added combinations of transformations and interactions between features, such as multiplication and division, which might capture more complex relationships in the data.
- New features such as `f2 f3 - f4 f5 + sqrt` are introduced to represent complex arithmetic relationships.
- The use of operations like `tanh` and `cube` in combination with other features can capture nonlinear relationships.

2026-01-17 16:43:08,882 - INFO - llm output = To create a more effective feature set for predicting credit card application success, let's combine the insights from both feature sets. 

The first set has a broader range of transformations applied individually and in combinations, while the second set expands these combinations further, particularly emphasizing interactions with `f2` (YearsEmployed) and nonlinear transformations. For a better set, we'll focus on combining useful interactions and transformations from both.

Here's a combined and potentially more predictive feature set:
- Simple and transformed features: `[f8, f10, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f8 tanh]` 
- Transformation of combinations focusing on interactions with `f2` (YearsEmployed): 
  - `[f2 f8 *, f2 f10 stand_scaler *, f2 f8 tanh *, f2 f8 stand_scaler tanh *, f2 f10 stand_scaler tanh *]`
- Expansion of nonlinear interactions and transformations of combinations:
  - `[f2 f7 * f8, f2 f7 * f8 stand_scaler, f2 f7 * f10 stand_scaler, f2 f7 * f8 tanh *, f2 f7 * f10 tanh *, f2 f7 * f8 stand_scaler tanh *, f2 f7 * f10 stand_scaler tanh *]`
   
This new set continues leveraging employment (`f2`) in combination with other features (like `f8`, `f7`, `f10`), while applying scaling, nonlinear transformations, and maintains some potentially useful standalone features (`f8`, `f9`, `f10`). These combinations could capture nonlinear interactions effectively, aiming to improve prediction accuracy for the given task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

**Explanation:**
1. **Feature Scaling and Transformation:** Use of `stand_scaler`, `quant_trans`, and `tanh` operations help normalize and rescale features, potentially highlighting latent relationships within the data.
2. **Higher-Order Interactions:** Products and compositions of features, e.g., `f2 f8 *`, `f2 f7 * f8 stand_scaler *`, capture interactions that may influence credit card approval.
3. **Exponential and Hyperbolic Functions:** Usage of operations like `tanh`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` for certain features (`f5`, `f10`), which can help model non-linear relationships.
4. **Feature Compositions:** Combinations such as `f8 stand_scaler tanh`, `f7 * f8 stand_scaler quant_trans`, and `f10 reciprocal f9 *` are created to capture both scale and effect of features in the prediction task.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 f0 + ,f14 f1 + ,f14 f2 + ,f14 f3 + ,f14 f4 + ,f14 f5 + ,f14 f6 + ,f14 f7 + ,f14 f8 + ,f14 f9 + ,f14 f10 + ,f14 f11 + ,f14 f12 + ,f2 f8 stand_scaler * ,f2 f8 tanh * ,f2 f7 * f8 stand_scaler * ,f2 f7 * f8 tanh * ,f2 f7 * f2 f8 stand_scaler tanh * *]
```

In this improved feature set, I've merged elements from both examples, retaining basic interaction terms and linear combinations, while incorporating powerful interactions with transformations like `stand_scaler` and `tanh`. This provides a good balance by maintaining linear combinations of important base features (like in the latter example) and including meaningful interaction terms augmented by scaling and non-linear transformations (like in the former example).

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:43:34,904 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the examples provided, we can incorporate transformations that might capture more intricate relationships in the data and could potentially improve the performance of a downstream task. Given the examples provided, we noticed an emphasis on min-max scaling and the use of various transformations like `cos`, `tanh`, and `square` in addition to basic feature inclusion.

Here is a suggested improvement to the second feature set, incorporating additional transformations and interactions:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 quan_trans ,f14 sqrt ,f13 cos ,f14 tanh ,f14 square ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 minmax_scaler ,f2 minmax_scaler ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f5 minmax_scaler ,f6 minmax_scaler ,f7 minmax_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 minmax_scaler ,f10 minmax_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f12 minmax_scaler ,f14 quan_trans minmax_scaler ,f1 f7 * minmax_scaler, f1 f8 * minmax_scaler, f0 f9 * minmax_scaler, f2 f12 * minmax_scaler, f3 f11 square]
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Added Transformations and Interactions**: We added interactions between various pairs and applied min-max scaling to standardize them.
2. **Kept Useful Transformations**: The previously successful transformations like `cos`, `tanh`, and `square` were retained.
3. **Additional Squaring**: Squaring `f3 f11` was added to potentially capture nonlinear combinations better.
4. **Extended Scalings**: Ensured every cross-feature interaction was scaled appropriately to prevent skewness from dominating learning.

Integrating these more complex features could offer better model insights and improvements in prediction accuracy.

```

Explanation of improvements:
- The third example includes the use of repeated transformations such as `log log` for `f1`, suggesting a deeper nonlinear transformation which could capture more complex patterns.
- Combining stand-scaled and min-max scaled outputs (e.g., `f0 stand_scaler`, `f1 sigmoid stand_scaler`) in interactions can help with capturing the standardized importance of features.
- Mathematical transformations like `tanh`, `sin`, and `cube` are applied selectively to features that might exhibit nonlinear relationships with the target.
- Interaction terms (e.g., `f2 f8 tanh *`) that combine scaled features with nonlinear transformations are aimed at capturing complex interdependencies.
- Enhanced combination of reciprocal and scaled transformations (e.g., `f10 reciprocal`, `f10 stand_scaler minmax_scaler`) provide a balance between variation suppression and preservation.

This new feature set aims to incorporate a mixture of transformations and interactions that can uncover hidden insights that are potentially predictive of credit card application success.

```

Explanation of new transformations:

- `f3 f7 * reciprocal`: This combines the feature for marriage status and years employed and applies a reciprocal transformation, potentially highlighting scenarios where marital status against years employed has interesting patterns.
  
- `f2 f11 sqrt +`: Adds a non-linear interaction (square root transformation) of Debt and DriversLicense; useful for capturing non-linear relationships.
  
- `f3 f5 log +`: Applies a logarithmic transformation to the combination of marriage status and industry, which can stabilize variance and may introduce linearity between these two features.
  
- `f10 sigmoid`: Uses a sigmoid transformation on the credit score, which can normalize values and capture non-linear effects potentially useful for classification tasks.

This involves selecting and transforming features in a way that could improve the prediction model for determining successful credit card applications. Here's a proposed feature set with some adjustments and transformations:

```
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f13, f14, f14 sin, f14 cos, f3 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f12 minmax_scaler, f14 sin minmax_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f1 f7 *, f1 f8 *, f1 f9 *, f1 f10 *, f1 f12 *, f1 f5 minmax_scaler *, f1 f6 minmax_scaler *, f1 f8 minmax_scaler *, f1 f9 minmax_scaler *, f1 f10 minmax_scaler *, f4 stand_scaler, f13 cos, f14 tanh, f14 square, f5 f8 /, f6 f9 +]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transformation and Scaling**:
   - Retained several `minmax_scaler` transformations as they can handle different ranges and improve model generalization.
   - Added `stand_scaler` for feature `f4`, assuming it might benefit from standard scaling to center around a mean and unit variance.
   
2. **Feature Combination and Interaction**:
   - Kept multiple interactions between `f1` and other features (`f7`, `f8`, `f9`, etc.) since these can capture non-linear interactions.
   - Included additional combinations `f5 f8 /` to explore possible inverse relationships and `f6 f9 +` to capture additive interactions.

3. **Non-Linear Transformations**:
   - Added `f14 cos`, complementing the existing `f14 sin`, to exploit cyclical patterns.
   - Preserved and expanded use of trigonometric transformations (`sin`, `cos`) and ensured to include them alongside other scaling methods for better distribution adjustment.
   - Kept transformations such as `f14 tanh` that can help in focusing on values between -1 and 1, and `f14 square` for exploring quadratic effects.

By using these feature engineering techniques, it's possible to capture more subtle patterns within the dataset which can result in improved predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 16:44:02,264 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and aiming to improve the feature set for the prediction task, we should leverage both the variation in scaling and combinations of features/operations. Here's a new feature set that aims to enhance predictive performance:

```plaintext
[f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f13, f14, f14 sin, f3 stand_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f14 sin stand_scaler, f14 minmax_scaler, f1 f7 *, f1 f8 *, f1 f9 *, f1 f10 *, f1 f12 *, f1 f5 minmax_scaler *, f1 f6 stand_scaler *, f1 f8 stand_scaler *, f1 f9 minmax_scaler *, f1 f10 stand_scaler *, f13 cos, f14 tanh, f14 square, f0 f8 - log, f11 f3 * cos, f6 f8 + sqrt minmax_scaler, f2 f6 * log, f4 f5 * sqrt, f10 f7 + cube, f6 f14 * tanh]
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Variety in Scaling**: Mixed use of `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` is maintained to see different kinds of normalization effects, especially useful when the range and scales of features vary.

2. **Feature Interaction**: Continued combination of features like `f1 f7 *`, `f1 f8 *`, etc., which provide interaction terms that might capture nonlinear relationships.

3. **Transformation Enhancements**: Addition of operations like `cube`, `tanh`, and `sqrt` applied to combinations to capture potential non-linearities that may improve prediction.

4. **New Combinations**: Such as the combination `f10 f7 + cube` to explore another interaction potentially capturing more variance related to the target.

These transformations are designed to derive higher-dimensional representations of the data, which often helps in improving model performance, especially when using algorithms capable of capturing non-linear relationships.

Explanation:
1. I've retained the original features (f0 to f14) from the second set as it contains all the original features.
2. I've included transformations like `f14 quan_trans` and `f14 sqrt` from the second set because they provide diversified and potentially useful transformations of the Income feature.
3. Kept `f5 minmax_scaler` and added other scaled features (`f6` to `f12`) as they were already in both examples, indicating likely importance.
4. Incorporating interactions and transformations such as `f1 f7 *`, `f1 f8 *`, and `f1 f5 minmax_scaler *`, as they might uncover potential nonlinear relationships and insights with the Age feature.
5. Included various non-linear transformations like `f14 sin`, `f14 square`, `f14 tanh`, and `f13 cos`, since they can capture non-linear patterns in the data that simple linear transformations might miss.

Rationale:
- Preserved original features for baseline comparison and interpretability.
- Min-max scaling and standard scaling of individual features to ensure that they are normalized and have unit variance, respectively.
- Introduced features like interactions (e.g., `f0 f1 *`) capturing potential relationships between variables.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:44:27,470 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets, here's a new feature set that combines and improves upon the previous ones. The goal is to create a set of features that capture essential relationships and transformations found in the dataset while keeping the format consistent:

```

Explanation:
- This new feature set combines useful features from both provided sets.
- It retains key interactions, such as age-related multiplications and additions, which are likely to capture non-linear relationships with age.
- I've included relevant scaling transformations to standardize values, which can help in normalization for models that assume standard distributions.
- I've kept transformations such as cosine, tanh, sigmoid, and logarithms that can help in capturing non-linear relationships.
- Factorial and reciprocal calculations have been avoided to maintain stability.

This new feature set aims to harness the strengths of the previous features while introducing new interactions for improved predictive ability.

```

Explanation:

1. **Logarithmic Transformations (f0 f14 * log, f1 f14 * log, f2 f7 * log):** Applying a logarithmic transformation to interactions of features might enhance non-linearity and facilitate better differentiation of complex relationships.

2. **Non-Linear Combinations (f10 f9 * tanh):** Utilizing the `tanh` transformation on the product of two features to capture non-linear relationships.

3. **Complex Interactions (f8 f6 f1 * + tanh):** This combines a sum of products followed by a `tanh` transformation to create intricate feature interactions.

4. **More Non-Linear Transformations (f11 f13 tanh *):** Applying the `tanh` transformation followed by a multiplication to further emphasize non-linear relationships.

Adding these complex interactions and non-linear transformations will likely improve the predictive power of the feature set for the downstream task of predicting credit card application success.

```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Features**: Retain the raw features to serve as baselines.
- **Advanced Transformations**:
  - **Tanh and sinh**: Applied to capture non-linear relationships that can help model the intricate patterns in success probability.
  - **Multiplicative and Log Combinations**: Calculations like `f13 f14 * log` are used for interaction effects.
  - **Standardization and Scaling**: Use techniques like `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and transformations on original features let's normalize data, which can improve model performance.
  - **Higher-order combinations**: Calculations like `f0 f1 / cos` or `f7 f8 * sqrt` can reveal interactions or nonlinear scale adjustments in the data.
  
Remember, the idea is to capture complex patterns and interactions that help in improving prediction accuracy. All transformations are applied considering the range and spread of the original features.

The goal is to enhance prediction accuracy by generating features that hold more informative patterns related to the task of predicting credit card application success.

Here's a proposed feature set that combines elements from both examples, while integrating additional transformations for potentially better performance:

``` 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,
 f2 f6 * ,f3 f7 * ,f8 f4 * ,f10 f5 tanh * ,f11 f6 tanh * ,f12 f2 tanh * ,f13 f2 tanh * ,f6 f9 stand_scaler * ,f7 f8 stand_scaler * ,

 f0 f10 log + ,f3 f4 quan_trans tanh * ,f5 f6 quan_trans tanh * ,f7 f8 quan_trans tanh * ,f9 f10 quan_trans tanh *]
```

Rationale:
1. **Feature Interaction**: Maintaining feature interactions from the first example (e.g., `f2 f6 *`) may capture relationships between features that influence the target variable.

2. **Transformation**: Using transformations like `tanh`, `log`, `quan_trans`, and `minmax_scaler` help to standardize or visualize data features on different scales which can often be more informative for the prediction models.

3. **Combination and Smoothing**: Combining features with additions such as `f14 f0 +` captures direct linear relationships and complements the multiplicative interactions, while using `tanh` with interactions may smooth values, potentially reducing the impact of outliers.

This selection aims to balance complexity with clarity in generated features, ensuring diverse transformation coverage.

The goal is to enhance the features for better downstream prediction of credit card application success.

The transformations will emphasize combining scaling techniques with functional transformations (like logarithmic, trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions) and interactions between features. Here is the new feature set:

```plaintext

```

Here's a breakdown of some key additions and motivations:
- Utilized both min-max scaling and quantile transformations on `f14` to capture different distribution characteristics.
- Combined logarithmic and square root transformations for intensive interactions, such as `f1 f0 + sqrt` and `f5 f10 + sqrt log`, to capture non-linear relationships.
- Incorporated cosine and hyperbolic transformations, e.g., `f1 f11 * cos` and `f9 f6 * tanh`, for periodic and non-linear representation which might be especially beneficial for cyclic patterns or bounded information.
- Used feature products along with scaling, such as `f2 f5 * sqrt stand_scaler` and `f8 f9 * minmax_scaler`, to capture cross-feature interactions while managing feature magnitudes.
- Employed `f3 reciprocal` and `f12 f13 * reciprocal` to handle possible inverse relationships which could reveal hidden insights in data distribution.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

### Explanation:
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Many features are scaled using `minmax_scaler`, which normalizes values, making them more suitable for models sensitive to feature scaling.
- **Combinations and Interactions**: By multiplying or dividing features, we create interaction terms that capture combined effects, such as `f1 f2 *` and `f3 f5 *`.
- **Transcendental and Non-linear Transformations**: Functions like `tanh`, `sqrt`, and `log` are used to introduce non-linearity and capture complex patterns.
- **Quantile Transformation**: Used for `f14`, likely capturing income-related behaviors and helping to normalize the distribution.
- **Standardization**: `stand_scaler` provides another form of normalization, allowing the spread of features to match the distributional expectations of specific models.

These transformations should help to capture a wider range of relationships and distributions in the data, potentially improving model performance.

- Used combinations of operations to maximize feature transformation, especially focusing on the product of `f13` and `f14` followed by scaling for creating non-linear effects.
- Applied log transformation and scaling for feature `f1` to capture non-linear patterns and reduce skewness.
- Combined various scaling techniques (min-max and standard scaling) based on the feature context to maintain consistent ranges and distributions.
