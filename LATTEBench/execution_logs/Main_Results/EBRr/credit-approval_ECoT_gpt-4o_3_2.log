2026-01-17 16:31:18,614 - INFO - llm output = Considering the given feature sets and the operations involved, the aim is to create a set that balances complexity while providing potentially meaningful transformations for improved prediction accuracy. Based on the transformations provided in the examples, the second set seems to prioritize feature scaling and transformation operations that help in data normalization and enhancing linear separability.

Here is a newly suggested feature set:

```
[f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f2 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f2 tanh, f8 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f2 cos, f7 sin, f9 sin, f10 sin, f13 stand_scaler, f13 sqrt, f13 log, f13 sqrt cube, f13 sqrt stand_scaler, f2 sqrt minmax_scaler, f4 sqrt minmax_scaler, f7 f8 +, f10 f9 -, f7 f13 *, f8 f10 + f13 stand_scaler minmax_scaler, f2 sqrt minmax_scaler f8 sqrt *, f7 minmax_scaler f9 sqrt *]
```

- **Base Features**: Retain potentially important features that have been consistent: `f2` (Debt), `f7` (YearsEmployed), `f8` (PriorDefault), `f9` (Employed), `f10` (CreditScore), `f14` (Income). These selections aim to target financial stability, employment status, and credit history.

- **Basic Transformations**: For feature stability and non-linearity capturing:
  - Square root transformations for features: `f2`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`.
  - Tanh, sin, and cos transformations can capture cyclic patterns or non-linearities.
  
- **Standard Scaling and Combination**:
  - Apply standard scaling and min-max scaling on `f13` (DriversLicense), a binary feature, along with square root, cube, and penetration with other scaling due to its potential indicator importance.
  - Combine features with arithmetic operations aiming to capture interactions: `f7 f8 +`, `f7 f13 *`, etc.

This new feature set assumes that complex non-linear transformations, along with aggregating certain variables, might better capture interactions relevant for predicting credit card application success.

```

Explanation of a few newly crafted features:
- `f14 quan_trans tanh tanh`: Combines quantile transformation followed by successive hyperbolic tangent transformations for fine-tuned non-linear scaling of feature `f14`.
- `f8 minmax_scaler tanh f10 minmax_scaler tanh cube`: Creates a cube transformation to introduce stronger non-linear scaling patterns after min-max scaling and hyperbolic tangent transformation.
- `f13 f14 + tanh`: Adds features `f13` and `f14` and subsequently applies a hyperbolic tangent, encouraging interaction effects followed by non-linear scaling.
- `f8 tanh minmax_scaler f14 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler`: A combination of hyperbolic tangent and min-max scaling applied sequentially across features `f8` and `f14`, which could normalize and smoothen outliers or extreme values.

These transformations aim to offer novel perspectives and potential predictive power due to their combination of linear, non-linear, and interaction transformations.

- Apply mathematical transformations like cube, sqrt, reciprocal, and sigmoid to capture nonlinear relationships.
- Leverage operations such as minmax_scaler to adjust feature scaling across categories or numerical values.
- Use combinations that bring together different aspects, like employment years and income, citizenship status, or prior defaults.
- Consider ratios (e.g., `f7 f8 /`) to leverage interactions between married status and employment that can denote stability.
- Integrate complex operations like `log` and `tanh` for potentially capturing the impact of Debt and CreditScore features in various scales or distributions.

This refined feature set aims to amplify information captured through the interactions and transformations that could be insightful for predicting credit card application success.

- I've maintained some basic transformations like the square of features [f0 square, f1 square]. 
- Included complex combinations and transformations that seem beneficial in the latter provided example, like [f3 f8 + cube] for possibly capturing higher-level interactions.
- Introduced a complex cascade of operations, as with [f8 f8 + cube f1 f14 + f8 + cube +], which might capture intricate interactions and nonlinearities.
- Added a log transformation to one complex feature interaction [f1 f14 + f8 + log] to help manage skewness and potentially highlight multiplicative interactions in a linear space.
- Included the quantile transformation for a combination of features [f14 quan_trans f8 +] to reduce the impact of outliers.
- Added [f4 f12 +] for a simple combination interaction, which could capture an additive relationship between features.

1. **Original Features and Their Transformations**: Retain essential original features (f0, f1, ..., f14) with their transformations like reciprocal, square, and sigmoid.
2. **Sqrt Transformations**: Include square root transformations which can help reduce skewness, focusing on key numerical features (Age, Years Employed, Credit Score, Income).
3. **Feature Interactions**: Add interactions between meaningful features (e.g., Debt and Years Employed) to capture synergistic effects.
4. **Tanh Transformations**: Apply tanh transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
5. **Scalers**: Use standard and min-max scalers to facilitate more normalized data inputs for models.
6. **Complex Interactions**: Introduce some basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, division) to explore potential combined effects.

This improved feature set seeks to capture non-linear effects, manage feature scaling effectively, and consider feature interactions, which are key elements in enhancing prediction performance.

2026-01-17 16:32:00,244 - INFO - llm output = To improve the predictive power of the feature sets, let's combine and extend useful transformations, considering interactions and scaling. Here’s a new feature set created by taking inspiration from the examples you provided, while also seeking to enhance their utility for the task:

```
[f2 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f14 ,f2 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f7 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f8 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f10 sqrt minmax_scaler ,f13 stand_scaler minmax_scaler ,f2 sin ,f2 cos ,f2 tanh ,f13 sqrt cube ,f8 f2 + f8 + f9 f2 + f8 + + f7 f2 + f8 + f8 f2 + f7 + + + minmax_scaler ,f8 f2 + f8 + f9 f2 + f8 + + f8 f2 + f8 + f7 f2 + f8 + + + minmax_scaler ,f8 f2 + f9 + f7 f2 + f13 f0 + + f8 f2 + f7 + + + minmax_scaler ,f8 f2 + f9 + f7 f2 + f13 f3 + + f7 f2 + f8 + + + minmax_scaler]
```

Here’s a brief explanation of the approach:

1. We retained some of the individual features and simple transformations (such as `sqrt`, `tanh`, and `stand_scaler`) to preserve baseline intelligibility.
2. We included interactions and transformations from the previous feature sets that operationalized the relationships between variables like `f8` (YearsEmployed), `f2` (Debt), and other important socio-economic markers.
3. We continued to perform scaling (like `minmax_scaler`) to ensure that the composite metrics remained comparable and to aid the predictions.
4. Introduced periodic functions such as `cos` along with `sin` and `tanh` to capture nonlinear relationships that might be indicative of success trends.
5. This proposal is more condensed compared to the previous sets, focusing on a blend of direct, transformed, and aggregated features in a concise manner that avoids redundancy while aiming to maximize predictive insights.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:32:10,555 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, we can aim to create a new feature set that maximizes information by using a variety of transformations and combinations. The first feature set focuses on transformations based on the square root and scaling of various features, while the second set includes interactions (additions) and some cubing transformations.

Let's combine ideas from both to engineer a feature set emphasizing interactions, transformations, and scaling:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14,

 f2 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt,

 f2 sin, f2 tanh, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, 

 f13 sqrt stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler minmax_scaler,

 f14 cube, f14 f0 +, f14 f2 +, f14 f3 +, 

 f14 f5 + f6 *, f14 f7 f8 * +,

 f4 f5 *, f6 f7 *, f8 f9 *,

 f9 f13 + tanh, f10 f14 cube + sqrt]
```

In this new feature set, we include:

- Basic features for completeness and potential interactions.
- Square root transformations and sine/tanh transformations on select numerical features for non-linear relationships.
- Scaled and standardized features to normalize distributions.
- Interaction terms, both through addition across various dimensions and multiplication to capture non-linear effects.
- Cubed and cube root transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
- Complex interactions, especially involving influential features like income (f14) and credit score (f13).

Below is a new feature set, which incorporates additional transformations based on the examples provided, leveraging the features that were frequently referenced in both the examples and the statistical summaries of the original features:

### Explanation:
- **Log Transformation (f6 log f10 +):** Applying a log-based transformation to a combination of two potentially scale-variant features can help normalize the distribution and reveal underlying patterns.
- **Cube Transformation (f14 cube):** Cube transformation of the Income feature (after scaling) can enhance predictions by amplifying variations for certain ranges in income, which might correlate with credit card success.
- **Reciprocal Transformation (f2 reciprocal):** Applying a reciprocal transformation can help in cases where some values need to be amplified or reduced to reduce noise in features like Debt.
- **MinMax Scaling (f5 minmax_scaler):** Scaling the categorical data such as Industry for improved machine learning model performance.
- **Tanh Scaling (f1 f3 tanh *):** Combining a person's Gender and their marital status in a hyperbolic tangent function can account for complex interactions in social status and personal behavior.
- **Log-Sigmoid (f12 f13 siglog +):** This combines features of citizenship status and zip code, which may influence credit card approval likelihood based on regional and immigration factors.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Here's a potential improved feature set:

```

Changes and additions made:

1. Added a `f6 sin` feature to capture potential cyclic patterns in the categorical feature.
2. Combined features with `f7 * f8` to explore interaction effects between `YearsEmployed` and `PriorDefault`.
3. Included `f12 log` to transform ZipCode as logarithmic transformation can be relevant for skewed distributions.
4. Added `f11 cube` to emphasize feature extremes which may capture nonlinear trends.
5. Incorporated `f8 + f13` to explore combined effects of `PriorDefault` and `ZipCode`.
6. Added `f9 reciprocal` to invert the `Employed` status, emphasizing contrastive behavior.
7. Added `f5 / f14` and `f3 + f10` for additional combinations related to employment and bank customer status with credit history relevance.

These transformations aim to enrich the feature space capturing more relationships and variations, potentially aiding in better classification of credit card application success.

- **Transformed Features (e.g., f2 sqrt minmax_scaler, f7 sqrt minmax_scaler):** These apply mathematical functions and scaling to make comparisons across records more reliable by normalizing values.
- **Feature Interactions (e.g., f8 f2 + f9 + f7 f3 * f10 f9 + + + minmax_scaler):** These complex combinations capture non-linear relationships and potential interactions between features.

2026-01-17 16:32:33,857 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, I will design a new feature set that aims to improve the predictive power for determining the success of credit card applications. I'll integrate useful transformations and combinations while seeking to retain critical information from the existing features.

New feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14 f8 cube cos -, f13 f1 +, f14 f7 - cos f8 cube -, f14 f9 cube - cos f8 -, f2 sigmoid, f2 tanh, f3 stand_scaler, f4 reciprocal, f7 f10 + sqrt, f5 f14 - log, f6 f12 / minmax_scaler, f14 f14 cos - cos f8 cube - reciprocal]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Original Features (f0 to f14)**: Start by including all original features to maintain a base from which interactions can be explored.
2. **f14 f8 cube cos -**: Resulting from subtracting the cosine of the cube of `f8` from `f14`, potentially capturing some nonlinear relationships influenced by income and default history.
3. **f13 f1 +**: Adding `f1` to `f13` may capture combined effects of ZipCode's economic context with age, which could be significant predictors.
4. **f14 f7 - cos f8 cube -**: This uses cos transformations that could help capture non-linear associations with years of employment.
5. **f14 f9 cube - cos f8 -**: A subtraction of the cos transformation from a cube feature aims to explore interactions between employment status and income effect.
6. **f2 sigmoid & tanh**: The sigmoid and tanh transformations applied to `f2` (Debt) could help normalize the impact of the variability in debt.
7. **f3 stand_scaler**: Standardizes the `f3` (Married) feature, often important in ensuring consistent scaling across numerical features.
8. **f4 reciprocal**: Creates a reciprocal to capture cases where an inverse relationship might be relevant in assessing credit.
9. **f7 f10 + sqrt**: The square root transformation helps stabilize variance and normalizes the effects derived from Years of Employment and Credit Score.
10. **f5 f14 - log**: A log transformation helps handle skewness, combining with the difference for understanding impact of consumer habits and income.
11. **f6 f12 / minmax_scaler**: Applying a min-max scaler provides normalization, dividing one financial attribute by another, capturing variations in financial stability.
12. **f14 f14 cos - cos f8 cube - reciprocal**: Captures complex non-linear relationships and balances them via reciprocal formula, ensuring potential overfitting avoidance.

This feature engineering strategy is targeted at enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle patterns and relations among variables, especially considering the predictors for success in credit card applications.

### Explanation of Improvements:

1. **Inclusion of Original Features and Squares**: Starting with both original features and their squares allows us to model non-linear relationships.

2. **Square Root Transformations**: Using square-root transformations on skewed features can help normalize them, making them more amenable to modeling.

3. **Standard Scaling and Min-Max Scaling**: These operations help bring features to similar scales, which is useful for models sensitive to scale.

4. **Combination Features (Multiplication)**: Including interactions (e.g., `f2 * f7`, `f7 * f8`, `f9 * f10`) allows capturing potential synergistic effects between different features.

5. **Combination Features (Addition)**: Adding features (e.g., `f2 + f9`) can help in capturing cumulative effects that might be indicative of a certain outcome.

6. **Non-linear Transformations (Sin, Tanh)**: Use of `sin` and `tanh` help in capturing cyclic patterns or non-linear relationships.

7. **Advanced Feature Transformations**: The inclusion of `cube`, `stand_scaler`, and combinations like `f13 sqrt stand_scaler` could help in capturing complex patterns that are not apparent with raw features.

8. **Redundant Feature Pruning**: By carefully combining features, we ensure that each addition to the feature set potentially improves model performance without unnecessary feature bloat.

2026-01-17 16:32:46,631 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature transformations, we can create a new feature set that optimally combines previous transformations while potentially adding some new ones to better capture non-linear relationships or interactions between features.

Here's one possible set of feature transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f0 square ,f1 square ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f5 square ,f6 square ,f7 tanh ,f8 square ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sin ,f11 tanh ,f12 sqrt ,f14 log ,f13 f1 + f2 f10 * ,f8 f7 tanh + ]
```

Here's the reasoning for choosing these transformations:
1. **Squared and Square Root Terms**: Squaring features can capture non-linear effects and interactions, especially for features that might have diminishing or accelerating effects. Square roots can help smooth out very large or non-linear data distributions.
  
2. **Tanh and Sin Transformations**: These non-linear transformations can model more complex relationships. Tanh, in particular, is symmetric and saturates which can be useful for features that should have thresholds. The `sin` function is periodic, useful for cyclical patterns if suspected in the data.

3. **Log Transform**: Using `log` on `f14` can help manage skewed data distributions, often common in features like Income.

4. **Sum and Product Interactions**: The interactions `f13 f1 + f2 f10 *` and `f8 f7 tanh +` present the interplay between features in novel ways that may capture underlying patterns missed by single features alone.

5. **Combination of Linear and Non-linear**: Incorporating both linear additions and non-linear combinations allows the model to learn both types of relationships that could contribute to an individual’s credit card approval success.

These transformations prioritize capturing complex patterns and interactions that exist within the data, which can improve prediction accuracy for the downstream task of predicting credit card application success.

2026-01-17 16:32:57,548 - INFO - llm output = To construct a new feature set that combines and enhances both given examples, while aiming for a better representation, we should incorporate techniques for scaling and non-linear transformation, as features that exhibit non-linearity often capture complex relationships that linear models might miss. We will utilize a combination of feature interactions, transformations, scaling, and adding non-linear components. Here's a suggested feature set:

```

```

Explanation:
- Basic features (f0 to f14) are retained.
- Interaction terms such as `f0 f8 +` and `f1 f9 +` are introduced.
- Transformations such as trigonometric (`cos`, `tanh`) and `cube` are used for non-linearity.
- Each feature is further included with a combination of operations to capture complex relationships.
- Some features use `minmax_scaler` for scaling after transformation, which helps in normalizing the dataset and improving model performance.

**Explanation**:

2. Applied `sqrt` and `minmax_scaler` transformations on `f13` and `f14` for scaling.
3. Introduced `f7 f8 f9 * sqrt` to capture compound interactions between `Employed`, `PriorDefault`, and `CreditScore`.
4. Combined several factors including `f14`, `f13`, and `f1` with addition and division to capture nuanced interactions possibly linked with `Income`, `ZipCode`, and `Gender`.

- Transformations like tanh, quan_trans, and cube to capture non-linearities.
- Log and sqrt transformations which provide different perspectives on the data.
- Combinations and interactions to explore joint effects like f13 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans tanh, and f14 cube tanh.
- Reducing redundancy but still capturing complexity with diverse transformations applied to various features, especially the feature f14 which seemed prominent in both examples.

This should improve the potential for capturing complex relationships in the data that could affect the prediction task.

2026-01-17 16:33:13,213 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples, we will aim to create a new feature set that reflects transformations and combinations that improve the prediction task. The latter example increases complexity and usability by applying a range of transformations like reciprocal, sqrt, square, tanh, log, sigmoid, and scaling, as well as arithmetic combinations. 

Given these transformations and their applications, here is a new feature set example:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14,

 f13 minmax_scaler, f14 tanh stand_scaler, f8 / f9 + f10, f6 square * f1, f0 + f3 - f5, 
 f4 reciprocal * f7, f14 sqrt / f11, f1 log * f13 cube]
```

In this new feature set:

- Mathematical functions like square, cube, reciprocal, sqrt, and log are applied to various features to capture non-linearities.
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos) are applied for additional non-linear transformations.
- Arithmetic operations between features add interactions that could capture dependencies between features.
- Standardization (`stand_scaler`) and Min-Max scaling are used for features where range and distribution matter, adjusting the features useful for various model types.
- The combination operations attempt to create multivariate relationships that could be crucial in determining credit card application success.

This feature set is designed to encapsulate a broad set of transformations that can be explored and validated for improving prediction outcome metrics.

- `f5 f6 - log` models the difference between industry and ethnicity effects.
- `f0 f6 * stand_scaler` combines gender and ethnicity to extract potential interaction effects, standardized for zero mean and unit variance.
- `f3 f5 f9 + *` interacts age, industry, and employment status, reflecting economic factors influencing credit card applications.
- `f10 f2 sqrt /` divides credit score by debt, after applying a square root to the debt, which creates a scale-adjusted credit efficiency metric.

In particular, we might favor the utilization of quantile transformation, cube, and log transformations for non-linear feature transformation, which can capture different patterns. Here's a proposed feature set leveraging these insights:

 f14 square tanh, f10 sqrt tanh, 
 f14 log tanh, f14 cube tanh]
``` 

In this proposed feature set:
- **Tanh** and **quan_trans** (quantile transform) are used to handle potential non-linear relationships and rank-based normalizations.
- Several **tanh** transformations of original features, and even some of their transformations, are included to explore non-linearity and saturation effects.
- **Cube**, **log**, and their combinations with **tanh** are included to introduce non-linear transformations and adjustments to the distribution.
- **Sqrt** is used to reduce skewness and variance in the feature data.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 16:33:44,823 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two given feature sets, let's create an improved feature set that leverages both original features and transformations to enhance the predictive power of the feature set for the task of predicting successful credit card applications. We'll strive to include a diverse range of transformations that capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between features.

Here is a potentially better feature set based on the given examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f2 cube, f4 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f13 sigmoid, f14 tanh, f8 f9 +, f2 f10 *, f1 f14 +, f3 f11 +, f7 f14 *]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Original Features**: I preserved all original features (f0, f1, ..., f14) as they might contain important individual information.
   
2. **Cube Transformation**: Applied to selective features. E.g., (f2 cube, f4 cube, f8 cube) aims to model nonlinear relationships and capture higher-order effects.

3. **Sigmoid and Tanh**: Focusing on bounded transformations can be useful for features that need normalization, such as (f13 sigmoid, f14 tanh).

4. **Interactions**:
   - Sum and product transformations between pairs of features, such as (f8 f9 +) and (f2 f10 *), aim to capture interactions and potential synergistic effects.
   - Combining features across different scales might help model complex relationships.

5. **Emphasis on Meaningful Combinations**: Selected combinations that could logically interact in a meaningful way in the real-world scenario of credit applications, such as linking employment-related or credit-related features.

This feature set combines a variety of transformations and interactions designed to capture complex patterns and improve model predictions.

2026-01-17 16:33:57,470 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature transformation examples and understanding that combining different transformations can potentially bring out more meaningful patterns for prediction, here's a new feature set that integrates useful transformations in a potentially more effective manner:

```

```

Explanation:
- I retained and slightly altered some core transformations like the quantitative transforms on features `f13` and `f14`.
- Used `minmax_scaler` and `sigmoid` where appropriate to handle potential skewness and non-linearity in distributions.
- Combined transformations like `cube` with `quan_trans` and `sigmoid` to enhance feature expressiveness.
- Retained `tanh` transformations due to their utility in squashing values and emphasizing changes for values closer to zero.
- Enhanced emphasis on `f10` with its `sqrt` and `minmax_scaler` transformations combined, given its presence in both original feature sets.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 sigmoid]
 
 
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 tanh]

2026-01-17 16:34:05,970 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved set of features using the given examples and transformations, we will build upon the latter feature set (which is presumably better due to preferred transformation choices like `tanh`). We can enhance it further by including new transformations that might capture additional relationships or non-linearities in the data.

Here is a new, potentially improved feature set with transformations:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f14 tanh ,f1 sqrt ,f2 log ,f3 stand_scaler]
```

In this improved set:
- We retain the `tanh` transformation of `f14` because it was deemed better in the previous example.
- We add a `sqrt` transformation of `f1`, which could help reduce the skewness of Age if any.
- We include a `log` transformation of `f2` (Debt), potentially stabilizing variance.
- We apply `stand_scaler` to `f3` (Married) to potentially account for any distribution variance across this binary feature.

2026-01-17 16:34:12,279 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! Based on the two feature sets provided, I'll create an improved feature set by considering combinations, transformations, and scales that may enhance the predictive power for your credit card approval task:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f2 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f0 square, f1 square, f2 square, f3 square, f4 square, f5 square, f6 square, f7 square, f8 square, f9 square, f10 square, f11 square, f12 square, f14 sqrt, f14 cube, f13 f1 +, f14 f0 +, f14 f2 +, f14 f3 +, f14 f5 + f6 *, f14 f7 f8 * +, f4 f5 *, f6 f7 *, f8 f9 *, f9 f13 + tanh, f10 f14 cube + sqrt, f2 f9 *, f3 f10 * sqrt, f11 f13 + sqrt, f6 f8 * + sqrt]
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Extended Polynomial Features**: In addition to the square and cube of individual features, I included combinations like `f2 f9 *` to capture interactions.
   
2. **Root Transformations**: Combined root transformations with other operations, e.g., `f3 f10 * sqrt`, to potentially reveal underlying relationships in those features.

3. **Feature Smoothing**: By smoothing with transformations like square root and using hyperbolic tanh, transformed multiple features to potentially deal with skewness or outliers.

4. **Feature Interactions**: Built interactions between significant features (e.g., risk indicators like `debt` with credit score-related features) that may enhance prediction.

5. **Combination with Scaling**: Utilized transformations like stand_scaler and minmax_scaler in fewer cases to selectively standardize or scale important transformed features for improved interaction.

These transformations aim to leverage correlations, reduce feature skewness, manage feature interactions efficiently, and improve model performance.

**Explanation of key transformations:**
- Basic arithmetic and scaling operations are augmented with combinations to exploit potential nonlinear relationships.
- Square and square root operations capture nonlinear effects.
- Combinations using trigonometric and hyperbolic functions (sin, cos, tanh) might capture periodic relationships or rescale impact.
- Log and scaling operations help with normalizing features or emphasizing relative relationships, especially for features like income and debt.
- Constructed interactions (e.g., f9 f2 * f3 +) model complex relationships that could affect credit scoring.
- Inclusion of conditional or feature engineering constructs such as sigmoidsqrt and sin add nonlinear transformation potential that models combcomplex dependencies. 

This proposed feature set is intended to enrich the representation of the data, offering a variety of transformations that could help predictive algorithms discern patterns associated with credit card application success.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

Here's a new feature set that tries to improve upon the latter example by incorporating diverse transformations to capture different aspects of the data distribution and potential interactions:

```

```

In this feature set:
- Maintain existing non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `log`, `square`, and `cube` to capture different orders of interaction.
- Quantile transformations (`quan_trans`) are used for normalizing skewed data.
- Added `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` for standard normalization, useful for models sensitive to scale.
- Added `sigmoid` to squash values into a (0, 1) range, interpreting them as probabilities.
- Added `reciprocal` for emphasizing inversely related features.
- Introduced interaction terms (`f5 f6 *` and `f0 f14 +`) to capture potential interactions between the features that could be powerful in predicting success in credit card applications.

- We added the \(\text{sqrt}\) transformation on \(f1\) (Age) for a non-linear age effect.
- We added the \(\text{log}\) transformation on \(f2\) (Debt), which can help in reducing skewness in distributions and stabilizing variance.
- We standardized \(f3\) (Married) using \(\text{stand\_scaler}\).
- We calculated an interaction effect between \(f7\) (YearsEmployed) and \(f13\) (ZipCode) by multiplying them. This could capture location-based career stability.
- Finally, we applied the \(\text{sigmoid}\) function on \(f9\) (Employed) to constrain the employed feature to a range, highlighting differences more effectively.

2026-01-17 16:34:45,561 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, the objectives of feature engineering here are to explore new transformations, embrace different mathematical operations, and scale the features to create a more meaningful representation for the predictive modeling task. Given the task of creating a better feature set, here is a proposed combination derived from the examples:

```
[f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14, f2 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f13 stand_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f2 sqrt minmax_scaler, f9 cube sin, f14 f7 - cos, f8 f3 + reciprocal, f1 f4 / log, f5 f6 + sqrt, f6 tanh, f7 f2 - sigmoid, f10 f10 sqrt *, f12 minmax_scaler, f14 stand_scaler minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Overall Structure**: This feature set is a blend of feature transformations inspired from both the previous examples. It maintains the objective of enhancing feature representation using diverse functions and scaling techniques.

2. **Diverse Mathematical Operations**: Operations like `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `tanh`, and `reciprocal` are considered to explore their non-linear relationships.

3. **Scaling and Centering**: Using `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` allows for normalizing feature values, ensuring they are on comparable scales, which can be crucial for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude.

4. **Combinations and Interactions**: Combining and interacting features as seen with expressions like `f14 f7 - cos` and `f1 f4 / log` allow exploration of relationships and offer complex patterns potentially beneficial for improving predictions. 

5. **Focus on Influential Features**: Given the influence of credit scoring attributes seen in the problem description, several transformed variants of `f2, f7, f9, f10` are maintained.

By leveraging these transformations, the expectation is that the new feature set can uncover stronger patterns and interactions, aiding in better prediction efficacy for the credit card application success task.

Explanation of the new transformations:
1. **f0 sqrt** - Applying square root transformation to the feature `Gender` which can help in normalizing and reducing skewness in the data.
2. **f2 log** - Applying logarithm transformation to the `Debt` which can help in normalizing the distribution especially when dealing with large range values.
3. **f8 square** - Squaring the feature `PriorDefault` to accentuate individuals who have defaults, emphasizing the severity of past defaults.
4. **f13 reciprocal** - Reciprocal transformation on `ZipCode` to inversely scale the zip codes, giving more weight to higher zip codes.
5. **f6 f7 *** - Interaction between `Industry` and `YearsEmployed` to reflect the influence of industry experience.
6. **f4 f10 /** - Ratio between `BankCustomer` and `CreditScore` to capture the relationship between having a bank account and creditworthiness.

This feature set includes both non-linear transformations for individual features and feature interactions to uncover deeper relationships within the data, potentially improving predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

Explanation:

1. **`f0, f1, f2, f3, ...`**: Original features are retained for baseline purposes and to maintain the foundational data required for analysis.
2. **`f13 f5 * stand_scaler`**: The interaction between feature `f13` and `f5` scaled with standard scaling can highlight more relational patterns between them.
3. **`f3 sinh`**: Applying the hyperbolic sine transformation which can be useful in capturing the non-linear relationships.
4. **`f10 log`**: Log transformation enhances numerical stability and reduces skewness which could be useful for the CreditScore feature.
5. **`f11 sqrt f2 +`**: Combining the square root transformation with another feature can reduce variance while potentially improving linear relationship discovery.
6. **`f1 tanh f4 /`**: Using the hyperbolic tangent and division could be beneficial for capturing underlying relationships between Gender and BankCustomer-like features.
7. **`f12 square f9 cube -`**: Combining square and cube operations can help to exploit relational patterns between Income and Employment-like features.

These transformations aim to encapsulate interactions and distributions of the features that are assumed to be key to predicting credit card application success.

**Explanation**:
1. **Focus on Non-linear Transformations**: Using cube, tanh, sqrt, cos, and sin functions to capture non-linear patterns potentially present in data.
2. **Feature Interactions**: Combining different features using arithmetic operations and scales (e.g., +, -, *, /, reciprocal) to explore interactions.
3. **Scaling Techniques**: Applying scaling methods like normalization, standard scaling, and min-max scaling after transformations to ensure uniform scale for learning algorithms.
4. **Combining Multiple Transformations**: Incorporating more transformations per feature to create complex interactions (e.g., chaining functions to capture higher-order interactions).
5. **Maintaining Original Features and Adding Complexity**: Keeping original features accessible while adding transformed versions to cover various aspects you might have missed analyzing separately.

By leveraging advanced feature engineering techniques, you can improve model learning and prediction accuracy potentially. However, these processed features need to be thoroughly evaluated for validity and predictive performance in model experiments.

- Retained several transformations from both examples like square, reciprocal, tanh, sqrt, and cube as they are useful for capturing non-linear relationships.
- Combined and added more interactions between variables, such as `f3 * f4 * f9` and `f1 square * f8 sqrt`, to capture complex patterns.
- Ensured a balanced mixture of algebraic manipulations along with statistical transformations to boost the model's ability to capture various data relationships.
