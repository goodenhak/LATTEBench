you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:11:20,463 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the provided examples, let's leverage techniques like quantile transformation and other non-linear transformations that are effective in handling non-Gaussian data distributions. We'll balance the application of these transformations to avoid overfitting while ensuring the features capture latent patterns effectively.

Here’s an advanced feature set, considering transformations that may enhance predictive power:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,

```

**Explanation:**

- Use `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` extensively for normalizing and transforming distributions, often stabilizing variance for skewed distributions.
- The `reciprocal`, `cube`, and `cos` transformations can add non-linearity, capturing complex relationships.
- The `log` transformation is effective for handling skewness, particularly in features representing amounts or counts.
- Additional transformations like `tanh` and `sigmoid` are useful for compressing extremely large ranges or normalizing nonlinear relationships.
- Avoid redundant transformations to maintain computational efficiency and reduce overfitting risks.

2026-01-17 17:11:36,424 - INFO - llm output = Based on the feature engineering examples provided, the goal is to create derived features using transformations that enhance the predictive capability for the target task: deciding if a person receives credit or not. The transformations like `quan_trans`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `cos`, and `square` suggest using various mathematical transformations that may help capture nonlinear relationships or standardize features.

Considering the examples given, the latter example includes additional transformations on feature `f4` (credit_amount), which might be a key feature for predicting credit approval. It uses `reciprocal`, `cos`, `quan_trans`, and `square` on `f4`, and `quan_trans` on `f1` (duration), which is more extensive compared to the first example. Therefore, we'll consider further optimizing feature combinations and transformations by exploring interactions and compound transformations.

Explanation:
1. **`f4 reciprocal`, `f4 tanh`, `f4 quan_trans`, `f4 square`, `f4 cube`:** Multiple transformations to capture different aspects of `credit_amount` (`f4`) as it’s often a pivotal factor in credit decisions.
2. **`f1 quan_trans`:** Quantile transformation on `duration` (`f1`), a significant feature in assessing credit reliability.
3. **`f2 tanh`:** Tanh transformation on `credit_history` (`f2`) helps handle variations and bring non-linearity into the model.

Here's the reasoning for the additional transformations:

- **`f1 f4 * sqrt`**: Combining two numerical features with the square root can capture interactions in a non-linear fashion.
- **`f7 tanh`**: Applying hyperbolic tangent to the installment rate can help normalize its distribution and highlight mid-range values.
- **`f13 f19 - log`**: Subtracting and applying the logarithm to the combination of housing and foreign_worker might capture a trend on the impact of living situation and worker status.
- **`f4 f6 + cos`**: Summing credit_amount and employment, then applying cosine, could uncover periodic trends related to financial stability and employment length.

Here's a breakdown of the selection:

- The inclusion of various mathematical transformations like square root, logarithms, and reciprocal cater to different scales and distributions in the original data, allowing for the emergence of latent patterns.
- Combining feature interactions, shown as additions (e.g., `f4 f2 +`), helps capture relationships between features that are typically not learned through linear models.
- Using quantile transformations and cube operations can help deal with skewed distributions, normalizing them across a uniform scale.
- Maintaining a few original features that underwent basic transformations like log or sqrt but avoiding excessive nesting of such operations, which could lead to interpretative challenges and numerical instability.

This feature set takes the following considerations:
- We've included a mix of linear transformations, logarithmic, square root, and higher-order polynomial functions to capture potential non-linear relationships.
- Quantile transformation is used in multiple steps, which is robust to outliers and can stabilize variance and make features more Gaussian-like.
- We retained some features from each input example to maintain aspects of the provided sets.
- The inclusion of constructs like `f1 log`, `f1 cube`, `f1 quan_trans`, and higher-order quantile transformations like `quan_trans quan_trans` ensures exploration of deeper feature transformations.

This combination aims to better capture interactions and potentially improve predictions in the downstream task.

2026-01-17 17:12:04,272 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two provided examples and available operations, we can aim to generate useful transformations that might capture underlying patterns in the data more effectively. The second feature set already includes all original features and applies quantile transformation and a square root transformation, both of which are common techniques in feature engineering. We'll build on this by introducing additional transformations known for enhancing model performance.

Here's a proposed feature set building on the given examples:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f4 quan_trans ,f12 sqrt ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f5 log ,f12 reciprocal ,f7 quantile_trans]
```

Explanation:
- `f0 minmax_scaler`: Min-max scaling can be effective for normalization, particularly for algorithms that assume data is on a bounded scale.
- `f1 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling (z-score normalization) ensures all features have zero mean and unit variance, which can be particularly useful for models sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., SVM, k-NN).
- `f5 log`: Applying a logarithmic transformation can help in normalizing right-skewed distributions, such as the potential credit amount.
- `f12 reciprocal`: A reciprocal transformation is useful for transformating features with a decreasing rate of change as values increase.
- `f7 quantile_trans`: Applying quantile transformation can map the distribution of values to a uniform Gaussian-like distribution, which can help in dealing with outlier-prone features.

This feature set retains all original features and adds a mix of transformations to capture non-linear relationships and scale the data appropriately, potentially enhancing the predictive power for the downstream task.

Here is a proposed enhanced feature set:

```

### Explanation of Additions:
1. **Non-linear Transformation with trigonometric and hyperbolic functions**:
   - `f4 cos f7 / tanh`: This creates a non-linear interaction between feature `f4` and `f7` through a cosine and division operation, then applies the hyperbolic tangent, potentially capturing complex relationships.

2. **Interaction and Logarithmic Transformation**:
   - `f4 f1 * log`: This computes the interaction between `f4` and `f1`, then applies a logarithmic transformation, which could help manage large magnitudes and reduce skewness.

3. **Sinusoidal and Ratio Interaction**:
   - `f19 sin f18 /`: By combining a sinusoidal transformation on `f19` and taking a ratio with `f18`, this captures periodic relationships and allows for normalization and contrast enhancement.

These transformations are chosen to explore potential non-linear interactions and capture complex patterns significant in evaluating credit worthiness while handling diversity in data distribution and enhancing feature variability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:12:33,413 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the examples provided, we want to combine useful transformations and operations that capture non-linear relationships or interactions between original features. The goal is to generate derived features that are potentially more informative for the downstream task, in this case, predicting whether a person receives credit.

Here's an improved feature set built upon your examples:

```
[f0, f2, f3, f5, f7, f9, f11, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f4 tanh, f4 quan_trans, f12 quan_trans, f4 f4 /, f1 sin, f0 f1 *, f2 f1 *, f5 f1 *, f6 f1 *, f7 f1 *, f8 f1 *, f9 f1 *, f10 f1 *, f11 f1 *, f13 f1 *, f14 f1 *, f15 f1 *, f16 f1 *, f17 f1 *, f18 f1 *, f19 f1 *, f4 tanh f1 *, f4 quan_trans f1 *, f12 quan_trans f1 *, f4 f4 / f1 *, f1 sin f1 *, f12 reciprocal, f12 reciprocal f1 *, f7 f1 * f10 f1 * +, f10 f1 * quan_trans, f8 f9 * sqrt]
```

### Rationale:
- **f12 reciprocal**: Retained from the second set, as it may highlight records with possible issues in the related feature (potentially an important flag in decision-making).
- **f12 reciprocal f1 \***: New interaction term, combines the reciprocal transformed feature with another continuous feature, promising non-linear narrative.
- **f8 f9 \* sqrt**: Introduced an interaction followed by a non-linear transformation between two features which might demonstrate a meaningful combination, potentially revealing joint effect behavior.

This new feature set maintains a blend of original features, transformed features (via non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `quantile transformation`, `sin`), and interactions between features while also introducing new combinations aimed at enhancing model expressiveness and capturing complex relationships between variables.

### Explanation:

- **Feature Engineering Transforms Used:**
  - **Basic Transforms:** Direct usage of the original features (`f0`, `f1`, etc.), which gives the model an idea of the original data distribution.
  - **Min-Max Scaling and Quantile Transform:** Normalizing and transforming feature distributions to meet model's expectations or scale them to a specific range.
  - **Non-linear Transforms:** Using transformations like square, cube, and sqrt to capture and emphasize non-linear relationships within data.
  - **Reciprocal and Log:** These can handle large ranges in features and improve symmetry.
  - **Trigonometric Functions (sin, cos):** Used to model oscillations and periodic patterns which might exist subtly within data.
  - **Combinations of Transforms:** Applying multiple transformations in a sequence to non-linearly map the features into a more useful space.

- **Feature Combinations:**
  - Creating new features by combining basic features with operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division helps in capturing interactions between variables that might impact the credit decision.

This improved feature set builds on basic linear, non-linear, and interaction transformations, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of the input data for the purpose of predicting credit decisions effectively.

2026-01-17 17:12:48,301 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples and operations, the goal is to create a feature set that improves predictive performance through better feature engineering transformations. Between the two given feature sets, the second one uses fewer transformations and includes a sigmoid operation on `f1`, which can help capture non-linear relationships associated with the distributions of these features. However, we can improve upon this by incorporating additional transformations that may enhance model performance. 

Here's an improved feature set leveraging transformations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f1 sigmoid, f4 log, f3 stand_scaler, f0, f1 f0 * sin, f8 reciprocal, f1 f5 * cube]
```

**Explanation:**
- `f1 sigmoid`: Retained as it's desirable for squashing feature values between 0 and 1.
- `f4 log`: Logarithmic transformation is often beneficial for handling skewed data distributions, particularly for features that follow a power-law distribution.
- `f3 stand_scaler`: Standardizes the feature, making it have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, improving model convergence.
- `f1 f0 * sin`: Enhances non-linear interactions between `f1` and `f0`.
- `f8 reciprocal`: Using reciprocals for features that may have inverse relationships.
- `f1 f5 * cube`: Cubing helps capture more complex relationships within these interacting features. 

These transformed features aim to optimize feature representation for better model accuracy.

Let's derive a new set of features using the information from both examples provided:

```plaintext
[f1 ,f0 quan_trans ,f1 tanh quan_trans ,f4 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f0 tanh quan_trans ,f1 tanh ,f0 quan_trans tanh ,f9 quan_trans tanh ,f1 tanh quan_trans tanh ,f0 quan_trans tanh quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans tanh quan_trans ,f18 quan_trans tanh quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans tanh quan_trans ,f0 quan_trans quan_trans ,f2 tanh quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans tanh ,f11 quan_trans quan_trans ,f12 quan_trans quan_trans ,f18 quan_trans quan_trans ,f1 square ,f0 quan_trans tanh quan_trans tanh ,f1 tanh quan_trans quan_trans tanh ,f1 tanh tanh quan_trans tanh ,f7 quan_trans tanh quan_trans tanh ,f10 quan_trans tanh quan_trans tanh ,f16 quan_trans tanh quan_trans tanh ,f18 quan_trans tanh quan_trans tanh ,f2 tanh quan_trans tanh ,f8 quan_trans tanh tanh ,f11 quan_trans quan_trans tanh ,f14 tanh quan_trans tanh ,f18 quan_trans quan_trans tanh ,f0 tanh tanh ,f1 square tanh ,f1 log ,f1 quan_trans ,f0 f4 cos * ,f1 log quan_trans]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Preserved Features**:
   - A selection of individual features and transformations that appeared in both examples are preserved, as they are likely important and add value to the prediction model.
   - For instance, basic transformations such as `tanh`, `quan_trans`, and `tanh`, which are nonlinear transformations, can help in capturing complex relationships.

2. **Combination of Features**:
   - New combinations like `f0 f4 cos *` have been introduced. This creates an interaction feature by applying the cosine function to `f4` and multiplying it by `f0`, which could capture an interaction effect between these features.

3. **Novel Combinations**:
   - The most promising transformations from both examples are integrated, like `f1 log` for compressing the scale of `f1`, potentially revealing different insights.
   
4. **Quantile Transformations**:
   - Continued use of `quan_trans` has been emphasized due to its capability to transform features to follow a uniform or normal distribution, potentially improving the modeling phase.

This set is constructed to leverage transformations and interactions between variables that were hinted to be meaningful in both examples.

```

**Explanation of some choices:**

1. `f12 sqrt`: Applying a square root transformation can help stabilize variance for certain features, which might be beneficial for improving predictions.
2. `f13 log`: Logistic transformations can help manage skewness in distributions, making the feature more normalized and potentially improving model performance.
3. `f18 tanh`: The tanh transformation can squash inputs to a bounded range, which can be useful for neural networks by keeping input values in a consistent range.
4. `f14 reciprocal`: Applies a transformation that can help inverting proportional effects.
5. `f0 f1 +`: Summing two features might capture their combined effect, which could be significant for the prediction task.
6. `f2 f5 *`: Multiplying features may expose interactions not visible through linear analysis alone.
7. `f3 f4 + log`: This combination applies a log transformation after addition, potentially capturing nuanced relationships.
8. `f6 f7 * sqrt`: This combination leverages multiplication along with a square root transformation for stabilizing variance. 

By combining different transformations and operations on the features, the new feature set can capture more intricate patterns in the data which are useful for predicting whether a person receives credit.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

I have integrated transformations and feature engineering techniques like quantile transformation, logarithmic, reciprocal, square root scaling, and trigonometric functions, as well as some cross-feature interactions to create a diverse feature set. This approach aims to enhance the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions that may be present in the data.

**Explanation:**

- Retained some raw features like `f0`, `f2`, ..., `f19` for baseline inputs.
- Used `sin`, `tanh`, and `quan_trans` based transformations from both feature sets for non-linear capture.
- Kept multiplicative interactions like `f0 f1 *` for capturing feature interactions.
- Included `f12 reciprocal` to account for inverse effects.
- Added `f3 cube` and various `sqrt` transformations to explore cubic and root effects.
- Applied data normalization techniques like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to features which could benefit from scaling.

```

Explanation:

1. Retained original relevant features like f0, f1, f2, f3, f5 since they could be crucial and appear in both sets.
2. Added transformations like `f1 tanh` and `f4 log` from both lists, as non-linear transformations often help in demystifying complex patterns.
3. Used `f3 stand_scaler` from the second set to standardize feature f3, aiding in better model performance.
4. Kept higher-order interactions like `f1 f5 * cube` for capturing potentially complex relationships.
5. Incorporated a combination of reciprocal and trigonometric functions to explore different mathematical transformations.
6. Introduced new interactions, like `f2 f3 * f1 sqrt` and `f7 f10 * f1 +`, which might offer additional insights into multi-feature relationships.
7. Maintained some critical original feature transformations like `f1 sigmoid` from the second list, which can capture non-linearities.

The focus was to benefit from transformations involving trigonometric, scaling, logarithmic, reciprocal, and interaction terms across features, potentially uncovering subtle patterns useful for prediction tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:13:46,767 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided, I'll create a new feature set using transformations that aim to capture more intricate relationships between features, ultimately improving predictions for the task of determining credit approval. The objective is to use mathematical transformations that could help in better capturing non-linear relationships and scale features appropriately.

Here is the improved feature set in postfix expression format:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,

 f6 sqrt, f5 log, f19 sin f18 /, f1 sqrt,
 f0 cos, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f8 stand_scaler, f9 f13 + log, f4 f1 * sqrt]
```

This new feature set includes:

- Including a variety of mathematical transformations (like `tanh`, `cos`, `log`, `sqrt`) that help capture non-linear effects which can be crucial for complex relationships.
- Using `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `quan_trans` for scaling can help in normalizing data that may be inherently skewed, improving model convergence.
- Additional interactions (like f4 f1 * sqrt) are added to capture nonlinear interactions between explanatory variables. 
- Including both simple transformations as well as interactions can enrich the feature set, giving better flexibility to the predictive model.

```plaintext

1. Keeping a diverse mix of original and transformed features.
2. Ensuring multiple transformation methods are used (e.g., `log`, `sqrt`, `sigmoid`) to capture nonlinear patterns.
3. Incorporating feature interactions to capture dependencies between features.
4. Using feature scaling and power transformations like `stand_scaler` and `quan_trans` to stabilize variance and model complex relationships.
5. Including a mix of both quadratic and higher-order transformations to expand the feature space robustly.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f1 tanh ,f4 minmax_scaler ,f0 quan_trans ,f2 quan_trans ,f3 quan_trans ,f5 quan_trans ,f6 quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans ,f9 quan_trans ,f10 quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f14 quan_trans ,f15 quan_trans ,f16 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f18 quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans ,f1 tanh quan_trans ,f4 minmax_scaler quan_trans ,f0 tanh quan_trans ,f1 log ,f0 quan_trans tanh ,f1 square tanh]
```

### Explanation:
- I retained the original features (`f0`, `f1`, ..., `f19`) to ensure that the model has access to raw data.
- I included a variety of transformations from both sets, such as `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quan_trans`, to capture non-linear relationships.
- I included `f1 log`, `f0 tanh quan_trans`, and `f1 square tanh` from the first example, as they may capture important characteristics of the data.
- The combination of `tanh` and `quan_trans` is used in multiple variations across different features to explore the data space more effectively.
- `f0 quan_trans tanh` and `f4 minmax_scaler quan_trans` are included from the second set to leverage different transformation effects.
- `f1 tanh quan_trans`, present in both original sets, is included to exploit any non-linear scaling relationships this transformation might uncover.
- Redundancies have been reduced by not replicating similar transformations unnecessarily.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this improved feature set, I've added some common transformations that can help in normalizing and further extracting non-linear relationships from the data:

- `f1 sigmoid`: Retained from the second feature set as it can help in transforming values to a [0, 1] range.
- `f2 minmax_scaler`: Scales the feature f2 into a specific range, which can help with some algorithms requiring normalized input.
- `f10 log`: Applying log transformation can help with features that have a heavy-tailed distribution.
- `f18 tanh`: The hyperbolic tangent can effectively stretch or squeeze feature values to between [-1, 1], helping in normalization for some algorithms.
- `f13 stand_scaler`: Standardize f13 by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, which can be crucial for models like SVMs or logistic regression.

These transformations help in normalizing, rescaling, or extracting non-linear relationships without overly complicating the feature space.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:14:14,767 - INFO - llm output = Creating a more effective feature set involves leveraging transformations that can enhance the predictive power and represent potential interactions or meaningful scales among the features. Here’s a new feature set based on the provided examples:

```

```

In this new feature set:
- Variations using square root, log, and reciprocal transformations are added to provide different scales and potential non-linear interactions.
- Cube transformation is included for its capacity to highlight or exacerbate differences in magnitude across features.
- Standard scaling and min-max scaling are used to normalize features, potentially reducing bias due to varying scales.
- Functions like tanh and cos are added for capturing more complex relationships; these can help to introduce non-linearity in the data and capture periodic behaviors.
- Keeping f1, f2, f3, f4 in multiple transformation forms maximizes the potential of these frequently involved features, which could be crucial in predicting the credit approval.

Here's a breakdown of what was added:
- `f6 square`: Squaring a numerical feature (e.g., employment) can help model quadratic relationships if they exist.
- `f2 f8 /`: Dividing two numerical features to investigate potential interaction effects or to standardize one feature by another.
- `f3 f14 *`: Multiplying two features could capture interaction effects that aren't additive.
- `f19 sqrt`: Taking the square root of certain features could adjust the skewness of the distribution if that feature is not normally distributed.
- `f0 f16 +`: Adding two features might reveal additive relationships or enhance signal if those features are correlated with the target variable in an additive manner. 

The transformations selected are aimed at potentially improving model performance by enhancing non-linear relationships and adjusting feature scales/distributions.

We should aim to enhance the feature set's ability to capture complex patterns in the data. Here's a possible improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f1 minmax_scaler, f4 sqrt, f3 f3 *, f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f5 log, f8 reciprocal, f6 sin, f7 tanh, f10 sigmoid, f13 square, f2 f4 *, f9 f15 /, f14 f18 -, f3 f1 minmax_scaler *, f11 f12 quan_trans /, f1 f17 stand_scaler /]
```

This improved feature set includes:

1. Various scaling transformations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler`, as they help normalize the data for models sensitive to feature magnitudes.
2. Non-linear transformations such as `sqrt`, `log`, `sin`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `square`, and `reciprocal` to capture non-linear relationships.
3. Interaction terms like `f2 f4 *` and `f9 f15 /` to capture the combined effects of multiple variables.
4. Differences like `f14 f18 -` to capture potential offsets between features.
5. Ensures diverse transformations are applied to a wide range of features to enhance the representation of the data.

These transformations aim to extract more meaningful patterns from the data, thus potentially improving predictive performance.

- Hyperbolic tangent of `f10` for capturing saturation effects.
- Multiplication and square root combination `(f6 * f9)` to form a new interaction term.

These transformations are intended to enhance feature representation and improve model performance in predicting credit eligibility.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Logarithmic transformation to compress scales of values and enhance variance in smaller numbers.
- Reciprocal transformation for inverse impact, useful for skewed data.
- Square and cube to introduce potential non-linear relationships.
- Stand_scaler and minmax_scaler are used for normalization and scaling of data which is crucial for many machine learning models.
- Tanh function to compress and treat potential outliers.
- Additional use of transformations across various features to potentially capture complex interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:14:54,930 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets you've provided, we want to enhance the feature engineering by combining key transformations to better capture the complexity of the data. The aim is to create a new feature set that could potentially improve the predictive performance of the model.

Let's integrate beneficial transformations and interactions from both examples:

1. Keep the base features for completeness.
2. Leverage different transformations that capture non-linear relationships, such as square and reciprocal.
3. Utilize scaling and transformation techniques like minmax_scaler, quan_trans, and stand_scaler to standardize and normalize the data.
4. Combine transformations that explore interactions and correlations further, such as combining reciprocal with other transformations for specific features.

Here is a proposed improved feature set, building upon the components from both examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, 
f1 minmax_scaler, f7 reciprocal, f12 quan_trans, f10 f14 -, f3 f3 *, 
f1 minmax_scaler reciprocal, f4 f1 -, f1 minmax_scaler reciprocal stand_scaler, 
f4 quan_trans, f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 f5 * sqrt, f11 f18 /, f7 f15 *, f17 log, f3 cube]
```

In this feature set:
- We include various advanced scalings and transformations (e.g., minmax_scaler, quan_trans) that help normalize the data and capture distribution-specific nuances.
- Interaction terms and non-linear transformations (e.g., squares, reciprocals, cubes) explore potential feature interactions and complex relationships.
- Feature differences (e.g., `f10 f14 -`) and combinations (e.g., `f3 f5 * sqrt`) could highlight critical feature interactions not apparent from the base features.

This enhanced feature set strategy should provide a strong foundation for modeling, helping to improve predictive accuracy for the downstream task.

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f1 sigmoid, f4 log, f3 stand_scaler, f0, f1 f0 * sin, f8 reciprocal, f1 f5 * cube, f7 sqrt, f10 tanh, f2, f6 f9 * sqrt, f0 f2 / tanh, f14 f11 cos, f9 square, f3 f4 + stand_scaler]
```

In this improved feature set:
- The original transformations have been maintained to utilize the power of non-linear operations.
- New combinations and transformations have been added to capture intricate relationships:
  - `f0 f2 / tanh`: Captures the interaction between features `f0` and `f2` with a non-linear transformation.
  - `f14 f11 cos`: Applies a trigonometric transformation to discover periodic trends or cycles.
  - `f9 square`: Enhances the impact of `f9` by squaring it, capturing potential quadratic relationships.
  - `f3 f4 + stand_scaler`: Combines two features followed by standardization to ensure they follow a normal distribution centered around zero.

```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **f12 square**: Square transformation amplifies the effect of feature 12, potentially revealing nonlinear relationships.
2. **f8 log**: Log transformation can help reduce skewness in distributions, revealing relationships that might not be apparent otherwise.
3. **f14 minmax_scaler**: Min-max scaling helps normalize feature 14 to a common range, assisting in comparison across different scales.
4. **f9 cube**: Cubing can capture nonlinear relationships involving feature 9 more effectively.
5. **f3 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling normalizes feature 3 to zero mean and unit variance, facilitating better analysis through clustering or classification methods.

These transformations are aimed at enhancing the feature set’s ability to capture complex relationships that may improve prediction accuracy in the downstream credit approval task.

### Explanation:
1. **Incorporating Transformations:** The feature set includes key transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, `reciprocal`, `log`, and combinations thereof for certain features (`f0` to `f19`), aiming to capture non-linear relationships and normalize distributions effectively.

2. **Arithmetic Combinations:** Added interactions such as `f0 f1 *`, `f2 f1 *`, `f6 f1 *`, and others to capture potential multiplicative effects or interactions between features that could be predictive.

3. **Preserving Effective Operations:** Maintained effective transformations such as `f8 f9 * sqrt` from the second example, which could capture complex relationships between features.

4. **Feature Variety:** A balanced mix of individual feature transformations and combined operations has been incorporated to maintain variety, which aids in capturing different aspects of data characteristics.

The proposed feature set leverages transformations and interactions that potentially enhance predictive ability while ensuring variety to account for non-linear patterns and feature interactions.

2026-01-17 17:15:25,464 - INFO - llm output = To create a new feature set that combines elements from both given examples and attempts to enhance predictive power, we can select a diverse set of transformations. We'll aim to capture non-linear relationships and interaction effects while utilizing a mix of scaling, transformation, and mathematical operations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7 tanh, f8, f9, f10, f11 quan_trans, f12, f13 sin, f14, f15, f16 sqrt, f17 log, f18, f19, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 cube, f7 reciprocal, f12 minmax_scaler, f15 reciprocal, f1 minmax_scaler reciprocal cube sin, f4 f1 - tanh, f7 f3 * sqrt, f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 cos f7 / tanh, f4 f1 * log, f19 sin f18 tanh /]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Basic Features**: Retaining all original features `f0` to `f19` ensures that the base information is preserved.
  
- **Transformations**: Overlapping transformations like `quan_trans`, `tanh`, `sqrt`, `log`, `sin`, `reciprocal`, and `cube` are utilized to introduce linearity and handle skewness or magnitude differences.

- **Scaling**: The use of `minmax_scaler` and `reciprocal` help ensure features are within a common range, potentially improving convergence and performance of certain machine learning models.

- **Interactions**:
  - `f1 minmax_scaler reciprocal cube sin` captures high-order interactions of `f1`.
  - `f4 f1 - tanh` captures the difference interaction between `f4` and `f1`.
  - `f7 f3 * sqrt` captures multiplicative interactions between `f7` and `f3`.

- **Feature Combination and Non-linearity**: Ensuring a combination of features with different operations like division and multiplication, while integrating non-linear transformation (e.g., `f4 f1 * log`) amplifies complex patterns and relationships between original features, potentially increasing model expressiveness. 

This set provides a richer feature space for learning more accurate predictive models.

```

Features Explanation:
- Incorporates individual feature transformations like `sigmoid`, `log`, `sqrt`, `cube`, `tanh`.
- Combines features using mathematical operations (`*`, `/`, `+`) for potential interaction effects.
- Includes versatile transformations like `stand_scaler` to standardize features which helps in models sensitive to feature scales.
- Ensures each transformation builds off previous features, intending to capture non-linear relationships more effectively.

This transformed feature set should offer more nuanced representations of the data and contribute towards better predictive performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:15:41,196 - INFO - llm output = Given the two sets of transformed features, we can aim to generate a better feature set by incorporating deeper transformations and keeping valuable information from both sets. Let's first prioritize more complex transformations, like multi-level quantile transformations, since they often capture non-linear relationships effectively.

Here’s a proposed transformed feature set:

```
[f0 ,f1 sigmoid ,f2 quan_trans ,f0 quan_trans ,f5 quan_trans ,f11 quan_trans ,f18 quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans ,f4 quan_trans quan_trans ,f1 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans ,f3 quan_trans quan_trans ,f7 quan_trans quan_trans ,f8 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans ,f10 log ,f17 quan_trans quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans cube ,f8 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans ,f14 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans ,f15 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans ,f19 quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans ,f12 sqrt quan_trans quan_trans quan_trans]
```

Explanation:
1. Retain some of the simpler transformations from the first list, such as the sigmoid function on `f1`, as it can help with non-linear scaling.
2. Use multi-layer quantile transformations on selective features like `f1`, `f3`, `f8`, `f13-f17`, `f19` to capture complex interactions and nonlinearities in the data.
3. Include `log` transformation for `f10`, as it can effectively handle skewed distributions.
4. Utilize the `cube` transformation on `f17` to introduce non-linear interactions.

This feature set aims to combine the width (variety of transformations) and depth (layers of transformations) of the transformations to potentially capture more complex patterns in the data for improved predictive performance.
