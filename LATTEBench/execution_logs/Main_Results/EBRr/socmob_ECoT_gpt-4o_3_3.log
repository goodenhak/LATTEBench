Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

In this set:
- I've kept the original features `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` to retain the original structure.
- I included `f1 square f3 sigmoid *` to capture potential nonlinear interactions involving `f1` and `f3`.
- Added `f4 sin` and `f4 sin square` to capture periodic relationships.
- Used `f0 sin f3 cube *` to explore interactions involving sinusoidal and cubic transformations.
- Applied `f2 square stand_scaler` to potentially normalize the squared values of `f2`.
- Retained `f3 cube f1 sigmoid * sin` for its complex capturing of relationships. 

These transformations aim to enhance the model's ability to predict the target variable by capturing more subtle and complex interactions among the features.

Reasoning:
- Utilizing `minmax_scaler` on `f4` and then applying `cube` to handle non-linearity, and using `tanh` which is effective for compressing values into a bounded range. 
- Selected combinations like `f4 f3 * minmax_scaler` to exploit interactions between features with proper scaling.
- `f1 stand_scaler sqrt` for standard scaling reducing outlier effects alongside a smoothing operation (`sqrt`).
- Adding transformations like `sin` after minmax_smoothing to capture cyclical patterns or distributions.

These transformations enable compression, expansion, smoothing, and improved scaling effects, enhancing model predictiveness by crafting features that can better capture latent structures.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 20:26:36,028 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature set examples provided, let's create a new and improved feature set using postfix operations while drawing inspiration from the examples. The key is to enhance the transformations and combinations of the existing features to extract potentially valuable information for the classification task:

1. `f0 sin` and `f4` are common. We'll combine them with new operations.
2. Use arithmetic operations and transformations to explore interactions between features.

Here is a proposed new feature set:

```
[f4 sqrt, f0 sin, f4 f3 log *, f2 f4 / tanh, f1 f2 f4 + + cube, f4 f3 - sqrt, f0 f1 * f2 cos +, f4 f1 + reciprocal, f3 f4 * log, f0 f4 + sqrt, f1 f4 / minmax_scaler, f2 f3 / stand_scaler]
```

In this set, we are:
- Applying basic mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, and division.
- Using transformations such as logarithm, cube, square root, sine, and reciprocal to capture non-linear relationships.
- Attempting complex interactions between features, such as `f0 f1 * f2 cos +`, emphasizing multi-feature interaction.
- Scaling using `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to normalize features, helping models to converge quickly and improve prediction accuracy.

This diverse set of transformations should help in capturing various underlying patterns in the data, potentially improving the ability of a model to distinguish between the positive ('P') and negative ('N') classes.

**Explanation:**
1. **Keep Basic Features:** Retain the original features `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, and `f4` to ensure that the essential raw data is available for modeling.

2. **Transformations:**
   - Incorporate trigonometric functions like `sin` and `cos` which can help in capturing non-linear relationships.
   - Utilize smoothing transformations like `tanh` which help in normalizing extreme values.
   - Combine features through multiplication which can introduce interaction effects into the model.
   - Incorporate power transformations (`square`, `cube`) which adjust skewness and can improve linear estimations.

3. **Scaling:**
   - **Standardization** using `stand_scaler` can help in adjusting features to have zero mean and unit variance, improving model convergence and training speed.

By applying mathematical and scaling transformations, this feature set aims to capture complex relationships within the data and potentially enhance prediction accuracy.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f4 ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 f4 * minmax_scaler ,f0 stand_scaler ,f1 stand_scaler ,f4 tanh ,f4 f1 * ,f4 tanh sigmoid ,f4 f4 * minmax_scaler tanh ,f3 minmax_scaler stand_scaler ,f4 f1 * sigmoid]

2026-01-19 20:26:52,313 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set for the downstream task, we can combine insights from the previous examples and introduce some feature transformations that could enhance the predictive power. Here's a better feature set:

1. Keep some of the original transformations that have been consistent in both examples.
2. Introduce additional complex transformations that might capture nonlinear relationships.

Here's the new feature set:

```
[f4 ,f4 f4 * ,f3 minmax_scaler ,f4 f4 * minmax_scaler ,f4 f0 * ,f4 f1 * ,f4 tanh ,f4 f3 / sigmoid ,f4 f0 * tanh ,f4 f1 * tanh ,f4 f4 * tanh ,f4 f3 / cos ,f4 f0 * minmax_scaler]
```

In this improved set, I've added:
- A division transformation (`f4 f3 /`) to potentially capture ratios that might be significant.
- A `cos` transformation to capture cyclical patterns if any exist.
- Continued use of `tanh` and `sigmoid` combinations for nonlinear transformations.

These transformations aim to provide a richer feature space that could enhance the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes ('P' and 'N').

The better feature set should leverage diverse transformations to capture different aspects of the data:

```plaintext

```

Explanation:
1. The new set maintains the original features `[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4]`.
2. Includes a transformation from the first example using `quan_trans` and `tanh` to reduce impact of outliers.
3. Further enhances by adding trigonometric transformations like `sin` and `cos` applied to capture cyclical patterns.
4. Introduces `sqrt`, `cube`, and `reciprocal` for nonlinear relationships and interactions.
5. Combines feature transformations using arithmetic operations to capture more complex patterns.
6. Maintains scalability using `stand_scaler`, ensuring features have a common scale, aiding models like linear regression or SVM.

This combination aims to balance transformation diversity with practical enhancement for predictive tasks.

Starting from the second example's approach of directly involving original features and scaling techniques, I'll integrate some non-linear transformations seen in the first example. Here's a merged and improved feature set that maintains the format as demonstrated:

[f4 f2 - ,f4 f2 sin sin - cube ,f4 f2 - cube tanh ,f4 f2 sin - cube tanh ,f4 f4 f1 sin - cube + ,f4 f4 f2 sin - cube + ,f4 f4 f2 - cube tanh + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f1 sin - cube + + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f2 sin - cube + + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f2 sin - cube sin + + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f2 - cube tanh + + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f2 sin - cube sin tanh + + ,f1 stand_scaler ,f2 stand_scaler ,f3 stand_scaler ,f4 stand_scaler ,f1 cube ,f2 log ,f1 tanh f4 * ,f4 f2 / f3 tanh +]

In this feature set:

- Scaling and standardization from the second example are considered for linearity, applying `stand_scaler` to f1, f2, f3, and f4.
- Non-linear operations such as `sin`, `cube`, `tanh`, and `log` are utilized for capturing potential non-linear relationships, derived from the first example.
- Interaction terms like `f1 tanh f4 *` and transformations like `f2 log` are added to capture interactions and non-linear trends.
- Complex combinations attempting to distill the difference in values with adjustments, such as `f4 f2 /`, offer possible significance in understanding the relationships in the data.

- Included trigonometric transformations like `sin` and `cos` for each of `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to capture any periodic patterns in the data.
- Used `tanh` and `log` transformations, which can help manage outliers and skewness in feature `f4`.
- Introduced combinations of features with operations like `tanh`, `log`, and `sin`, which could reveal complex interactions.
- Kept the `minmax_scaler` and `sqrt` transformations as they are useful for normalizing and reducing skewness.

Here is a new feature set considering the latter set is typically better due to scaling and transformation operations:

```

Explanation:

- I used `tanh` and `sigmoid` functions to introduce non-linear transformation.
- Applied scaling (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) to ensure numerical stability and standardization, especially when multiplying different features.
- Combined original features (`f4`, `f2`, `f3`) with transformations to create more features that might capture underlying patterns.
- Focusing on the latter example's structure, I maintained an emphasis on transformations that also handle magnitude differences (e.g., multiplication with scaled values).

2026-01-19 20:27:52,052 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, the goal is to create a more effective feature set for predicting the target class. The first example focuses primarily on arithmetic operations involving the target feature (f4) and other features, whereas the second example integrates trigonometric transformations along with f4, emphasizing logarithmic and tanh transformations.

To create a more effective and diverse feature set, we'll leverage both trigonometric and arithmetic operations, prioritizing transformations that are likely to help in separating the classes better. Additionally, we'll include scaling, as it assists in handling varied feature scales. Here's a proposed feature set:

[f4, f0 cos, f1 sin, f2 tanh, f3 log, f4 sqrt, f4 f1 + f2 + cos, f4 f0 + f2 + tanh, f4 f1 + f3 + log, f4 f0 + f3 + sqrt, f4 minmax_scaler, f4 f0 + reciprocal, f4 f1 + square, f4 sin, f4 f2 + cube, f4 f1 + f0 + sin]

This feature set:
1. Retains the focus on the target feature (f4) while integrating other features.
2. Uses a combination of trigonometric and logarithmic transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
3. Incorporates both arithmetic additions and transformations such as square, cube, and reciprocal, which may highlight different patterns.
4. Includes scaling techniques to address feature range issues and improve predictive performance.

Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 20:28:50,902 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature sets, it seems like the aim is to enhance the feature engineering process by combining the original features using various operations to create new, meaningful features that could improve the model's ability to predict the target effectively. In the latter part, standard scaling of the original features is used, which is a common technique to bring all the features to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values.

Now, combining these different approaches, here's a new feature set that attempts to balance complexity with interpretability and potential predictive power:

```plaintext
[f4 f2 - ,f4 f2 sin sin - cube ,f4 f2 - cube tanh ,f4 f2 sin - cube tanh ,f4 f4 f1 sin - cube + ,f4 f4 f2 sin - cube + ,f4 f4 f2 - cube tanh + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f1 sin - cube + + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f2 sin - cube + + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f2 sin - cube sin + + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f2 - cube tanh + + ,f4 f2 - f4 f4 f2 sin - cube sin tanh + + ,f4 f2 stand_scaler - ,f3 f4 + stand_scaler ,f4 f2 - f4 f2 * stand_scaler ,f1 f3 square + minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanations:
1. **Standardized Differences**: Using standard scaling on the difference between `f4` and `f2`, can help normalize the feature since differences might indicate shifts or changes in trends.
2. **Combination and Scaling**: Adding `f3` and `f4` before applying standard scaling helps create a feature that considers more than one input variable, possibly capturing broader effects.
3. **Extended Interactions**: Combining different operations (e.g., multiply and standard scale) for the difference between `f4` and `f2` promotes intricate interaction modeling while advancing interpretability.
4. **Combination Feature**: Adding squared values of `f1` and `f3`, followed by min-max scaling, preserves the rank and thus prevents large values from overpowering smaller ones, enhancing interpretability and robustness.
