2026-01-19 20:15:19,958 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature sets and their transformations, we can generate a new feature set that attempts to capture more complex relationships and interactions within the data.

Here's the proposed new feature set:

```

```

Explanation:
1. The first feature combines several transformations: standard scaling, quantile transformation, squaring, taking the sine, and applying a min-max scaler to mitigate the variance. It then applies further non-linear transformations with cube and sigmoid.
2. The second feature applies multiple transformations including standard scaling, quantile transformation, and nesting two sine functions to capture periodic-like behavior, followed by a square and min-max scaler. The reciprocal transformation is used potentially for down-weighting larger values.
3. The third feature captures interactions between `f3` and `f4` with cube and sigmoid transformations, and then applies the reciprocal to capture nonlinearity and possible diminishing returns.
4. It continues exploring the impact of nested sine transformations combined interestingly with the sigmoid transformation.
5. The fifth feature explores the interaction of `f4` with itself and introduces the hyperbolic tangent function to capture another layer of non-linearity.
6. Lastly, the sixth feature uses a combination of cubic, sigmoid, reciprocal, and square root transformations to capture complex patterns and scale effects in subtle ways.

Recall that the latter feature set example usually provides more sophisticated transformations with scaling and non-linear operations like `tanh` and `cube`.

Incorporate strategies like using `tanh` and `cube` transformations, which can help capture non-linear relationships, and a scaling/normalizing approach such as `minmax_scaler` to standardize features.

Given this understanding, here’s a new feature set combining these methods:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

The two feature sets include a variety of transformations such as arithmetic operations, scaling, and trigonometric operations.

For the new and improved feature set, I'll aim to incorporate meaningful transformations that could potentially capture complex interactions or patterns in the data. Here's an improved feature set suggestion:

This feature set includes: 
- Basic features for baseline information.
- Logarithmic and square root transformations for count variable (f4) to capture the non-linear relationships.
- Interaction terms that involve multiplication and division, potentially capturing complex dependencies.
- Trigonometric and hyperbolic transformations, encoded through the use of `tanh` and combined with divisions which might assist in smoothing outliers.
- Scaling procedures such as `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler`, which help normalize the data.
- A composite feature using cube transformation of combined features to capture higher order interactions.

2026-01-19 20:15:51,223 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples you've provided, the transformations in the latter feature set capture more complex interactions and use of mathematical functions like `cube`, `tanh`, and `cos`, which can introduce non-linearities and potential higher-order interactions. Such features might provide additional predictive power for models that can exploit these interactions.

To improve upon these examples, we could aim to further increase the complexity and introduce more diversity in the transformations, while also attempting to reduce redundancy among features. Here’s a new feature set incorporating some of these ideas:

``` 
[f4 f4 f4 + + cube f4 + f4 f4 + f2 f4 f4 + + + + tanh cos f4 f4 f4 + + cube f4 + tanh f4 f4 + + f2 f4 f4 + + tanh + ,f4 f4 f4 + + cube f4 + f4 f4 + tanh f2 f4 f4 + + + + cos f4 f4 f4 + f4 f4 f4 + cube + + + + sqrt ,f2 f4 f4 + + f4 + f4 f4 + + f4 f4 + cube f2 f4 f4 + + + f3 f4 f4 + tanh cube f4 + f4 f4 + f4 f4 f4 + + + + + + ,f4 f4 f4 + + cube f4 + f4 f4 + f2 f4 f4 tanh + + + + f4 f4 f4 + f4 f4 f4 + sin cube + + + + f4 f4 + f2 f4 f4 + + sqrt + +]
```

Here, I've introduced:

- More use of `tanh`, `cos`, `sin`, `cube`, and `sqrt` to capture non-linear effects.
- A mix of addition and function transformations to handle non-linear interactions.
- Aiming to provide enough variability amongst features with functions like `sin` and `sqrt`.

The goal is to provide the model with diverse transformed features that might capture complex underlying patterns in the data that simple linear features might miss. The choice of functions and operators can be adjusted based on the specifics of the domain and the model's ability to utilize non-linear relationships.

2026-01-19 20:16:06,089 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided postfix expressions and considering the goal to improve predictions by constructing potentially more informative features, it seems the second set of feature transformations involves significantly more complex combinations of the features than the first set, possibly exploring higher-order interactions and non-linear transformations.

For the task of improving the predictive power concerning the transformation of the feature "counts_for_sons_first_occupation" to a binary class target, crafting a feature that encompasses various interactions and transformations will likely be useful. Thus, I propose a new feature transformation, further extending from the complexity of the second set:

```
[f4 f4 f4 + + cube f4 + f4 f4 + tanh f2 f4 f4 + + + + f4 f4 + f2 f4 f4 + sin + + + cos , f4 f4 f4 + + cube f4 + f4 f4 + tanh f2 f4 f4 + + + + f4 f4 + f2 f4 f4 + sin + + + f4 f4 f4 + + + tanh f2 f4 f4 + + + + sin cube +]
```

Explanation:
1. This expression aims to create features that capture not only linear effects but also non-linear transformations (cubic, sin, tanh, cos, etc.) and interactions among the features.
2. The use of trigonometric functions and other non-linear applications (like cube and tanh) can help in capturing complex patterns in the data, which might be valuable for classification tasks where non-linear relationships are common.
3. These transformations might lead to better separation between the classes in the transformed feature space, potentially boosting model performance.

The examples indicate a preference for combinations that involve multiple transformations and operations to create complex features. From the two given feature set examples, I will attempt to design a more sophisticated and potentially better-performing feature set.

Let's generate a new feature set:

```
[f4 f1 - reciprocal stand_scaler, f1 f4 - f2 quan_trans - f1 f4 - f4 std_scaler - f3 quan_trans cube - - , f1 f4 - f3 minmax_scaler f2 quan_trans tanh - - , f1 f4 - f1 - f3 quan_trans minmax_scaler cube - - , f3 f2 - tanh minmax_scaler, f1 f4 - f1 - f4 minmax_scaler f3 quan_trans minmax_scaler - - , f1 f4 - f4 std_scaler f2 quan_trans minmax_scaler cube - - , f1 f4 - f2 minmax_scaler f3 tanh minmax_scaler reciprocal - - , f1 f4 - f1 - f2 quan_trans cube - -, f1 f4 - f4 std_scaler cube f2 quan_trans - - , f1 f4 - f1 minmax_scaler reciprocal f3 tanh quan_trans - - , f1 f4 - f1 - f3 minmax_scaler cube tanh - -]
```

Explanation:
- In the new feature set, I've combined operations such as subtraction, reciprocal, standard scaling, quantile transformation, cube, among others to derive more complex features, inspired by transformations in the previous examples.
- These transformations are aimed at capturing nonlinear relationships and scaling effects that might improve modeling performance.
- The usage of variations like reciprocal, cube, and different forms of scaling/transformation may help emphasize important characteristics of the data.

Note that the actual effectiveness of these features would depend on the distribution and nature of the data, so further evaluation and tuning could be necessary.

Here's an improved feature set:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f4 sqrt, f4 cube, f4 reciprocal, f4 tanh, f4 log, f4 stand_scaler, f4 minmax_scaler]

Explanation:
- **f4 sqrt**: Square root can help to reduce the range and handle skewness in positive values.
- **f4 cube**: Cubing can emphasize the differences between lower and higher values.
- **f4 reciprocal**: The reciprocal transformation is useful for highly skewed data and reducing the impact of large outliers.
- **f4 tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent can normalize individual values in the dataset, limiting them in the range of [-1,1].
- **f4 log**: Logarithm transforms heavily skewed features, and is often useful for count data.
- **f4 stand_scaler and f4 minmax_scaler**: These scaling tactics normalize the data to handle different scales and distributions.

Each transformation is included to address different aspects of the variance, scale, and skewness in the counts feature, hoping to enhance model performance.

In this new feature set, I've included a diverse array of transformations, ensuring a mix of basic arithmetic operations, scaling, normalization, and non-linear functions. Here's a quick breakdown of the considerations for these selections:
- Inclusion of transformations like squares, cubes, and square roots allows for capturing non-linear relationships.
- Arithmetic operations (+, *, /, -) between different features can help in studying interactions and relative differences.
- Nonlinear transformations like tanh and reciprocal can sometimes capture underlying patterns not visible otherwise.
- Scaling and transformations like log, minmax_scaler, and standard scaling help in normalizing the data, potentially improving the model's ability to learn meaningful solutions.
- Combination of features driven by thought implies aiming for higher explanatory power by exploiting potential dependencies between features.

Explanation:
- `f2 f4 *`: This captures interactions between two numerical features.
- `f3 sqrt`: Square root transformation reduces skew and can uncover relationships in data.
- `f4 sin`: Retained from previous to capture periodic patterns or inherent cyclical behavior.
- `f0 f4 / tanh`: The division followed by tanh transformation helps in normalizing the values, which can be useful for large range features.
- `f2 log`: Log transformation helps in dealing with skewness, common in survey or survey-derived datasets.
- `f1 cube`: This might reveal polynomial relationships that are non-linear between features.
- `f3 f4 + minmax_scaler`: Standardizing feature values helps in having features on the same scale, improving model efficacy and interpretability.

Here is a new postfix expression for feature transformations, taking inspiration from the improvements seen in the latter example:

```

```

Explanation:
- Added interactions using the `tanh` function on different combinations, as it's a powerful non-linear transformation that can capture complex patterns.

Key improvements:
1. Adding logarithmic transformation (`f1 f4 - f4 minmax_scaler - f1 log -`) to capture multiplicative relationships and reduce skewness in data.
2. Extending the range of non-linear transformations such as `f1 f4 - square - f4 reciprocal -` to explore quadratic interactions and inverse relations.
3. Adding transformations like `f1 sigmoid -` and `f4 sin -` for potential benefits from common neural network activation functions and trigonometric patterns.

6. `f4 stand_scaler quan_trans sin square minmax_scaler tanh reciprocal`

Here's a new feature set using the given operations:

In this new feature set, I have combined various operations like square root, logarithm, trigonometric functions, min-max scaling, and others, aiming to capture non-linear relationships and scale features into more comparable ranges. These transformations are designed to both leverage and go beyond the raw input attributes, possibly enhancing the model's ability to separate the data into the specified classes.

This new feature set incorporates the following aspects:

1. **Inclusion of a wider variety of transformations:** Retain useful transformations from both sets and add `sin`, `cos`, and `sigmoid` for potential nonlinear relationships.

2. **Redundancies reduced:** By combining the best elements of both, we avoid unnecessary duplications and focus on potentially powerful transformations.

3. **New transformation (sigmoid):** Added for handling potential non-linearities and probabilities.

Feel free to adapt these transformations based on specific insights from the dataset or additional domain knowledge.

2026-01-19 20:19:26,368 - INFO - llm output = Given the two feature set examples you provided, the goal is to produce a better feature set using the operations and transformations. We want to focus on creating interactions and transformations that could more accurately represent the underlying patterns in the data.

The latter example provided is quite complex and uses multiple operations to generate new features, while the former example is relatively simple. We'll aim to combine the complexity of the latter example with some simplification to ensure the generated features are meaningful and not overly intricate. 

Here’s a new feature set that takes inspiration from both examples with further enhancements:

```
[f4, f4 stand_scaler, f1 f4 - f1 - f2 tanh f1 f4 - *, f1 f4 - f2 quan_trans - f3 f4 - f1 minmax_scaler - *, f3 f4 - f1 f4 - cube f4 stand_scaler -, f3 f4 - f2 quan_trans - f1 quan_trans +, f4 log, f2 f4 - f4 minmax_scaler * f1 f2 + f4 log +, f4 sqrt f1 -, f3 tanh f2 f4 - +, f2 f4 / f3 square +, f4 stand_scaler sin]
```

Here's the reasoning for the new feature set:

- **Sequential transformations and scaling** have been paired with non-linear transformations to capture complex interactions (e.g., `f2 tanh f1 f4 - *`).

- **Log transformation (`f4 log`)**: Log can often help in normalizing the distribution of a feature, especially when dealing with counts.

- **Feature interactions and combinations**: Interactions between features through addition, multiplication, and division can reveal complex relationships (`f2 f4 - f4 minmax_scaler * f1 f2 + f4 log +`).

- **Non-linear transformations**: Usage of trigonometric functions such as `sin`, `tanh` and power transformations such as `cube` to offer non-linear conversions, especially helpful for capturing intricate patterns (`f3 tanh f2 f4 - +`).

These enhancements are designed to generate a feature set that aids more nuanced predictions while keeping the transformations computationally feasible.
