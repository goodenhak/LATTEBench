you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:51:17,007 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set by combining the given examples, we should focus on incorporating diverse transformations and different levels of complexity, while also ensuring some transformations are close to the core features to maintain interpretability. We'll aim to use a mix of the different transformations provided, leveraging both nonlinear transformations and scalers for normalization. Here's a proposed feature set:

```
[f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f13 ,f1 sigmoid ,f2 sigmoid ,f3 sigmoid ,f10 sigmoid ,f11 sigmoid ,f1 cube ,f2 cube ,f3 cube ,f10 cube ,f14 square ,f14 sigmoid ,f8 / f2 ,f5 square ,f7 square ,f13 sin ,f14 stand_scaler ,f0 sin ,f4 * f9 ,f6 - f11 ,f12 sqrt ,f14 sigmoid sigmoid ,f10 cube cube ,f1 sigmoid sigmoid]
```

This feature set includes:

- Core features: Ensures some original features are retained for baseline comparisons.
- Sigmoid transformations: Useful for compressing variables into a bounded range, capturing inherent nonlinearities.
- Cube and square transformations: Introduce polynomial features that can capture complex relationships.
- Stand_scaler: Normalization can be crucial to bring features to a similar scale.
- Sin transformations: Potent for cyclic pattern recognition.
- Arithmetic combinations: Introduce interactions between features.

This feature set aims to balance complexity and feature representation while introducing new potential interactions that could capture patterns or trends in predicting the success of credit card applications.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 16:51:37,271 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set, let's focus on combining meaningful transformations while adding complexity to capture potential nonlinear relationships. Here's a better feature set based on the provided examples:

In this feature set:
- The original features are retained for context.
- The `tanh` transformation of `f13` might capture nonlinearities related to citizenship features.
- Sigmoid transformations are used on various features to capture nonlinearity.
- Nested sigmoid captures further complex interactions.
- `f1` (`Gender`) underwent a square root and standard scaling transformation to consider scaling effects related to gender. 
- `f2` (`Age`) was transformed using a logarithm to capture age-related effects that might be exponential in nature. 

This approach balances capturing relationships with exploration of potential nonlinear effects while adding complexity where it might be meaningful.

2026-01-17 16:51:42,984 - INFO - llm output = To create a new and more effective feature set, I'll consider incorporating interactions of existing features while leveraging various mathematical and statistical transformations. The aim is to enhance predictive power and capture potential non-linear relationships that might be missed by linear combinations alone. Here's a refined feature set based on your examples:

``` 
[f1 ,f3 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f13 ,f14 ,f1 f3 * , f7 f11 * , f9 f13 * , f14 tanh , f14 f13 + , f11 f14 - , f14 / f3 , f13 f1 + stand_scaler , f13 f7 + minmax_scaler , f8 minmax_scaler , f10 square , f11 cube , f10 tanh , f14 sigmoid , f14 f11 * , f3 f14 * tanh , f11 minmax_scaler , f13 f1 + sigmoid , f14 sigmoid square , f14 f3 * square , f9 f10 * minmax_scaler sigmoid]
```

In this set, I've incorporated various interactions and transformations such as:

- Feature interactions like `f1 f3 *` and `f7 f11 *` to capture multiplicative effects between features.
- Using non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `square` on feature interactions and sums, which can capture non-linear relationships.
- Applying scaling techniques (`stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`) to some transformed features to normalize their values.
- Creating complex interaction terms like `f3 f14 * tanh` and `f13 f1 + sigmoid` to capture deeper interactions across different feature scales. 

The combination of these transformations and interactions should enhance the model's ability to capture a broader spectrum of relationships in the data.

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Feature Selection**: Kept key features like f8, f9, and f10, which seem to correspond to significant attributes (possibly income, credit score, etc.) based on their frequent transformation in given examples.
2. **Transformation Variety**: Maintained a range of transformations (e.g., `tanh`, `log`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, `sigmoid`) to capture different nonlinearities and scaling effects that might be beneficial for capturing complex patterns.
3. **Combination and Layering**: Combined various transformations (e.g., `tanh log`, `reciprocal sqrt`, `stand_scaler tanh`, `log reciprocal tanh`) to create nuanced features that may capture interactions or second-order effects.

This set is aimed to bring diverse perspectives on the data attributes, potentially enhancing model learning flexibility and predictive power.

- We have kept several base features to ensure they are still included.
- Applied 'cube' transformation to features with potential non-linear relationships, possibly boosting prediction performance.
- 'Square' and 'tanh' transformations emphasize potential quadratic and hyperbolic relationships, respectively.
- Used 'sin' and 'sigmoid' together in some cases for periodic and logistic transformations.
- Utilized 'stand_scaler' on a feature twice to address scale differences more prominently.
- Combined transformations in a manner that can potentially capture complex interactions, ensuring robust modeling capability.

A thoughtful combination of scaling, transformations, and interactions will create a robust feature set for predicting credit card application success. Here's a proposed feature set:

1. Keep original numerical features that might directly correlate to success: `[f2, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f14]`.
2. Create interactions with scaling and transformations: 
   - Use product interactions heavily with `f14`, which seems to play a significant role due to its recurrence in both sets.
   - Enhance those interactions using `square` and `sigmoid` functions for non-linear relations.
   - Create multiple layers of scaling and transformations on promising features, such as applying `minmax_scaler`, `sigmoid`, `square`, and hyperbolic tangent functions.

Here's the proposed combined feature set:

```

- **Sigmoid, Cosine, and Log Transformations**: Introduce non-linear transformations that could help in discovering patterns.
- **Cube and Reciprocal Transformations**: These transformations offer non-linear interactions between features.
- **Use of Square Root**: It can compress the scale of features and potentially reveal different aspects of data structures.
- **Combo of Scaling and Transformation**: Trying different combinations of scaling followed by transformation, or vice versa, might uncover additional data representation that can improve model prediction.

Each of these additional transformations brings a unique flavor to feature engineering, potentially allowing the model to capture intricate patterns within the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

We aim to retain foundational features (which seem important) while exploring improved expressions.

Here's a more refined feature set:

\[f1, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f1 \text{ sigmoid}, f2 \text{ sigmoid}, f3 \text{ sigmoid}, f4 \text{ sigmoid}, f5 \text{ sigmoid}, f6 \text{ sigmoid}, f7 \text{ sigmoid}, f8 \text{ sigmoid}, f9 \text{ sigmoid}, f10 \text{ sigmoid}, f12 \text{ sigmoid}, f14 \text{ cos}, f2 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f3 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f4 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f6 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f7 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f8 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f9 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f10 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f12 \text{ sigmoid sigmoid}, f13 \text{ tanh}, f14 \text{ cos sigmoid}\]

In this version, I added `f4 sigmoid sigmoid` from the foundational example, which is missing in your latter example but could prove important, given that `f4` represents marital status and using complex transformations might uncover interactions with other demographical data.

### Explanation
1. **Standard Scaling and Min-Max Scaling:** Applied to the results of some transformations to potentially improve normalization and predictive power.
2. **Cube Transformations with Min-Max Scaling:** Applied to features to capture potential non-linear relations and normalize the resulting range.
3. **Staggered Transforms:** Combined existing transformations with quantile transformation to facilitate normal distribution characteristics, potentially improving model robustness.
4. **Selecting Influential Features:** Included combinations involving multiple features with potential high significance or interaction effects like `f7`, `f8`, and `f14`.
5. **Incorporate Feature Differences and Root Transformations:** Introduced variants like `f14 sqrt` to capture non-linearity, and `f14 f5 -` to focus on feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:52:31,134 - INFO - llm output = To derive a better feature set for predicting credit card application success, we will incorporate transformations and function combinations that may capture nuanced patterns in the data. Given the previous examples, we will try to add meaningful transformations that can enhance predictive power. Here is a new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f13 tanh, f2 sigmoid, f4 sigmoid, f5 sigmoid, f6 sigmoid, f7 sigmoid, f8 sigmoid, f9 sigmoid, f10 sigmoid, f11 sigmoid, f14 cos, f2 sigmoid sigmoid, f3 sigmoid sigmoid, f6 sigmoid sigmoid, f7 sigmoid sigmoid, f8 sigmoid sigmoid, f9 sigmoid sigmoid, f10 sigmoid sigmoid, f12 sigmoid sigmoid, f14 cos sigmoid, f0 * f1, f3 / f11, f4 * f10, f12 cube, f5 stand_scaler]
```

In addition to the previous features, the new features include:
- `f0 * f1`: Interaction between Gender and Age could reveal different patterns for different gender-age groups.
- `f3 / f11`: Ratio of Debt to CreditScore might indicate financial health and creditworthiness.
- `f4 * f10`: Interaction between Married and DriversLicense can potentially capture stability and trustworthiness.
- `f12 cube`: Cubing ZipCode may help explore location-based credit trends.
- `f5 stand_scaler`: Standard scaling of Industry to assess variations more prominently.

These transformations aim to capture complex relationships that may not be apparent in raw features, thereby improving the likelihood of identifying successful credit card applicants.

```

Key transformations:

1. Retaining useful features from the second example such as tanh, sigmoid, and scalers to adjust non-linearity and scaling.
2. Adding squares and cubes of relevant features to capture higher-order interactions.
3. Mixing scalable transformations like stand_scaler with non-linear transformations to better capture relationships within data.
4. Harnessing combinations of the two feature sets with proven transformations to enhance model input significantly.

We'll aim to capture non-linear relationships and interactions while maintaining a balance between complexity and interpretability.

Here's the new feature set:

```
[f1, f3, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14, f1 square, f7 square, f8 square, f9 square, f10 square, f14 square, f2 sigmoid, f5 sigmoid, f13 f14 +, f13 f14 + stand_scaler, f1 square square, f14 sigmoid, f14 sigmoid square, f13 f1 + f13 +, f14 sigmoid square, f2 sigmoid sigmoid, f0 sigmoid sigmoid, f12 sigmoid sigmoid, f0 f14 * sqrt, f7 f8 + cube]
```

This feature set includes:

1. Raw features f1, f3, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, and f14 to maintain original information.
2. Square transformations on key features to capture non-linearities: f1, f7, f8, f9, f10, and f14.
3. Sigmoid transformations to handle potential skewness and provide a bounded output for f2 and f5.
4. Interaction feature f13 f14 + and its standardized version using stand_scaler to help combine correlated attributes.
5. Emphasis on high-order transformations, such as square square for polynomial calibration.
6. Use of sigmoid multiple times for smoother transitions: f2 sigmoid sigmoid and additional high-sensitivity sigmoids.
7. Feature transformation using cube, sqrt to explore higher and lower order interactions: f0 f14 * sqrt and f7 f8 + cube.
8. Combined transformations for potential complex interactions: f0 sigmoid sigmoid and f12 sigmoid sigmoid. 

This selection aims to improve the model while maintaining logical interpretability and computational efficiency.

When it comes to improving feature sets for predicting credit card application success, the goal is to create features that capture relevant patterns and relationships within the data while reducing dimensionality and enhancing interpretability. Given the two provided feature sets, I will generate a better one:

Considering the operations and transformations available, here's a combined feature set that leverages non-linear transformations and standardizations:

```
[f8, f10, f8 tanh, f10 tanh, f8 log, f9 log, f10 log, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f8 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f8 tanh log, f10 tanh log, f8 stand_scaler tanh, f10 stand_scaler tanh, f8 sqrt reciprocal, f10 sqrt reciprocal, f8 log tanh, f9 log tanh, f10 log tanh, f10 reciprocal sqrt, f9 log reciprocal, f10 tanh sqrt, f7 tanh stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler log, f8 tanh sqrt, f9 stand_scaler sqrt, f10 stand_scaler sqrt, f10 tanh log reciprocal, f7 reciprocal sqrt, f8 reciprocal tanh, f10 reciprocal tanh, f8 log reciprocal tanh, f10 log reciprocal tanh, f1 cube, f3 sqrt sigmoid]
```

### Explanation:
- **Retained features**: From the first set, several nonlinear transformations are maintained as they explore complex relationships between features.
- **Sigmoid Transformation**: Applied to scaled or normalized variables to map them into a bounded range [0,1], enhancing stability and interpretability.
- **Cube & Sqrt Sigmoid Operations**: These provide advanced modeling capabilities to capture more complex patterns, especially with regard to categorical data or interactions that might be nonlinear.
- **Prune Redundant Operations**: To avoid overfitting and improve efficiency, redundant or overly complex transformations are minimized.

These enhancements should result in a more predictive and interpretable feature set for the problem at hand.

**Explanation:**

- Retained some original features like `f1, f3, f7, f9, f10, f11, f14, f8` for their raw forms.
- Applied a combination of basic arithmetic operations and scalar transformations to ensure complex representations and interactions between features.

- Your first example emphasizes transformations like tanh, log, standard scaling, and reciprocal among subsets of features.
- Your second example uses the sigmoid function extensively, alongside the use of original features and tanh on f13.

Based on these observations, the new feature set will incorporate diverse transformations across the features to capture various nonlinear relationships and scale variations. Here's the proposed feature set:

```plaintext
[f8, f10, f0 sigmoid, f1 tanh, f2 tanh, f3 tanh, f8 log, f9 tanh, f10 tanh, f8 stand_scaler, f9 log, f10 stand_scaler, f8 tanh, f10 tanh, f1 minmax_scaler, f8 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f11 sigmoid, f13 tanh, f9 sigmoid, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal tanh, f8 tanh log, f10 tanh log, f8 stand_scaler tanh, f10 stand_scaler tanh, f8 sqrt reciprocal, f10 sqrt reciprocal, f8 log tanh, f10 log tanh, f6 tanh, f12 log, f7 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f7 log reciprocal, f8 stand_scaler log, f9 stand_scaler sqrt, f10 stand_scaler sqrt, f8 reciprocal tanh, f10 reciprocal tanh, f10 cube, f5 reciprocal, f11 tanh, f1 + f2, f3 * f4]
```

This feature set combines inherent feature transformations like tanh and log scaling, strategic scaling with sigmoid and standard scaling, and some interactions between original features to recognize compounded effects like addition and multiplication. The goal is to capture more complex relations that may not be evident in straightforward or isolated features.

2026-01-17 16:53:22,842 - INFO - llm output = To improve the predictions, let's carefully select from the provided sets and exploit combinations or transformations that could better capture the relationships in the data for improved model learning. 

Given the two feature sets, here is an optimized feature expression:

[f8 , f10 , f14 , f1 , f3 , f7 , f8 , f9 , f10 , f11 , f13 , f14 , f13 f1 + , f1 square , f14 square , f13 f1 *, f3 f8 * , (f14 sigmoid + f13 f1 +) stand_scaler , f7 square f14 f8 * stand_scaler , f13 cos , f14 f13 - square , f1 minmax_scaler square]

**Explanation of some choices:**
- Retain original important features (e.g., f8, f10), as they might be crucial predictors directly.
- Include combinations capturing interactions and non-linearities (e.g., f14 sigmoid + f13 f1 + stand_scaler, f3 f8 *), which can help in learning complex relationships in the data.
- Use transformations like square, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, sigmoid to introduce non-linearities and normalize data for more effective learning.
- Feature f13 cos is used to capture cyclical patterns that may relate to time or periodicity.

These transformations and combinations of features are intended to provide a diverse set of inputs to the machine learning model capturing not only scaled versions of individual features but also their relationships and nonlinear interactions.

2026-01-17 16:53:30,512 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set from the given examples, let's consider the transformations that have shown effectiveness in modeling nonlinear relationships while also preserving scale sensitivity. By analyzing the examples, we can identify operations that enhance feature variation and representation:

New Feature Set:
```
[f1, f2, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f14 stand_scaler, f14 sqrt, f14 sqrt cube, f13 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans sqrt, f13 quan_trans cube, f1 minmax_scaler, f1 tanh minmax_scaler, f1 cube, f2 cube, f3 cube, f5 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f12 cube, f14 stand_scaler cube, f14 f5 -, f14 f5 - cube, f14 f5 - sqrt, f1 cube cube, f13 cube, f13 square cube, f7 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f7 sigmoid minmax_scaler, f9 sigmoid minmax_scaler, f10 sigmoid minmax_scaler, f7 sigmoid minmax_scaler sigmoid, f9 sigmoid minmax_scaler sigmoid, f10 sigmoid minmax_scaler sigmoid] 
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Incorporating Useful Operations**: I've retained transformations like `cube`, `sqrt`, `stand_scaler`, and `quan_trans`, which model various feature experiences effectively and have been suggested in prior examples.

2. **Combination of Transformations**: Introduced combined operations to augment feature representations. For example, `sqrt` followed by `cube` or using `minmax_scaler` with `tanh`, enhancing the non-linear transformation capability.

3. **Preservation of Univariate & Multivariate Interactions**: Operations like `f14 f5 - cube` consider the interaction between features, which might contain rich information useful for predictions.

4. **Modeling Sensitivity and Scale Variance**: `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are essential to reduce sensitivity to scale variance across samples for more stable modeling.

This new set aims to balance complexity and representational strength, hopefully improving model performance in downstream tasks.

2026-01-17 16:53:37,286 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set for predicting credit card application success, we can combine operations and features effectively. Continuing the idea of utilizing transformations and selections from the previous example, here is a new feature set leveraging advanced transformations while maintaining simplicity and effectiveness:

Explanation:
- I maintained transformations using `log`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `reciprocal` due to their potential impact on modeling.
- Included `stand_scaler` to normalize features, potentially improving model generalization.
- Added combinations (`f1 + f8`, `f3 * f5`) to capture interactive effects that may better inform the prediction task.
- Balanced between complexity and utility, aiming for improved feature representation without overfitting the data processing stage.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 16:53:41,802 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! When designing feature sets to improve predictions, a good approach is to explore a combination of transformations that could enhance the signal captured in the data regarding the target variable. Here's a refined feature set based on the examples you provided:

```
[f1, f3, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f13, f14, f1 f3 *, f7 f11 *, f9 f13 *, f14 tanh, f14 f13 +, f11 f14 -, f14 / f3, f13 f1 + stand_scaler, f13 f7 + minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f10 square, f11 cube, f10 tanh, f14 sigmoid, f14 f11 *, f3 f14 * tanh, f11 minmax_scaler, f13 f1 + sigmoid, f14 f3 * square, f9 f10 * minmax_scaler sigmoid square, f14 sigmoid/log, f13 f14 f1 + * minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Preserved Transformations:** The transformations that involve interactions between features, such as multiplication or addition followed by another transformation (e.g., standard scaling, min-max scaling), are preserved since they can capture complex relationships between features.

2. **Modified Transformations:** Some transformations are improved by adding further transformations or more combinations that could derive non-linear relationships (e.g., `f14 sigmoid/log`) to potentially capture intricate relationships.

3. **Complex Feature Combinations:** New expressions adding feature interactions are introduced like `f13 f14 f1 + * minmax_scaler` which combines multiple features and scales them to capture complex relationships.

4. **Improved Representation for Features:** The sigmoid transformation is combined with square and log operations because it helps capture non-linear relationships in a bounded manner. These operations can potentially emphasize certain critical patterns within the features that are predictive of the outcome.

By integrating these options, the refinement aims to extract richer statistical relationships in the data that could improve model predictive performance.

We'll prioritize transformations that are known to often improve models, such as non-linear operations and scaling.

Here's a proposed feature set:

- Start with the common feature subset used in both examples: [f1, f2, f3, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14]
- Apply useful transformations on these features to capture non-linear effects:
  - f1 tanh
  - f1 sigmoid tanh (captures non-linear squashing effects)
  - f14 stand_scaler (standardization often helps, especially for linear dependencies)
  - f2 cube (captures polynomial interactions)
  - f3 square (squares often help capture quadratic dependencies)
  - f5 square
  - f6 tanh
  - f7 square (quadratic transformation can be beneficial for certain features)
  - f8 tanh
  - f9 cube
  - f10 square
  - f11 tanh
  - f12 cube
  - f13 sin tanh (combination of periodic and non-linear transformation)
  - f14 sigmoid square
  - f1 cube tanh
  - f1 square square (capture more complex interactions)
  - f13 cube cube
  - f14 stand_scaler square

Given these additions, this set combines elements from both examples but emphasizes transformations that may help capture complex dependencies and interactions in the data.

Explanation of choices:
- I included interactions like f1 * f14, and f9 * f10 which could be useful in capturing relationships between Age, Income, CreditScore, Debt, etc.
- I maintained useful transformations involving square, cube, and sqrt that suggest non-linear interactions and complex dependencies, particularly, the use of cube and sqrt for diversity in non-linear relationships.
- I employed diverse scaling techniques like stand_scaler and minmax_scaler which can help in normalizing the distribution of the features.
- I kept f13 quan_trans which may be particularly useful for handling categorical data ratios or counts which often follow non-normal distributions.
- Sigmoids and tanh were used selectively to introduce non-linear squashing which can model more complex feature interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:53:54,290 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature examples and the task of predicting credit card application success, we aim to generate a better feature set by considering transformations that could help capture non-linear relationships and interactions among features. We'll take into account both non-linear transformations and scaling methods that improve model interpretability and performance.

Here's a new feature set:

1. **Original Features**: [f1, f2, f3, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f13, f14]
2. **Transformed Features**:
   - **Scaled and Transformed Features**:
     - f2 tanh
     - f5 minmax_scaler
     - f14 sigmoid

   - **Interactions and Non-linear Transformations**:
     - f1 f3 *
     - f7 f9 *
     - f8 square tanh
     - f10 square sqrt
     - f11 sin

   - **Advanced Non-linear Transformations**:
     - f9 reciprocal
     - f12 log
     - f14 sigmoid sigmoid
    
   - **Complex Interactions**:
     - (f1 f3 *) (f7 f9 *) +
     - f8 square f10 square sqrt tanh *

These features emphasize interactions and non-linear transformations that are likely to capture complex patterns in data better than individual features. Utilizing operations such as sigmoid and tanh potentially normalize or smooth extreme values, providing more robustness in certain model types.

In this version:
- I've included interactions between features such as `f0 * f3` and `f10 tanh * f11` to capture potential compound effects.
- I've further incorporated non-linear transformations like `sqrt`, `tanh`, `log`, and combinations thereof.
- I've used scaling techniques intentionally to aid normalization and potentially capture variance meaningfully with operations like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`.
- I've crafted combinations such as `f1 tanh sqrt reciprocal` to add complexity and capture compound transformations.

These actions should help enhance predictive power by allowing the model to better fit complex relationships in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:54:04,884 - INFO - llm output = To create an improved feature set based on the provided examples, the goal is to construct transformations that potentially enhance the predictive capability for credit card application success. Below is the new feature set combining elements and ideas from both examples:

```
[f1, f3, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f13, f14, f1 f3 * square, f7 f11 * tanh, f9 f13 * sigmoid, f14 tanh, f14 f13 + cube, f11 f14 - stand_scaler, f13 f14 / reciprocal, f13 f1 + minmax_scaler, f13 f7 + minmax_scaler square, f8 minmax_scaler cube, f10 tanh, f11 tanh, f11 minmax_scaler square, f14 sigmoid cube, f13 f1 + sigmoid, f14 f3 * standard_scaler, f9 f10 * minmax_scaler sigmoid, f13 f9 * tanh]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Basic Features:** Start with including direct features such as `f1, f3, ..., f14` to maintain core information.

2. **Feature Interactions and Transformations:**
   - Interaction terms like `f1 f3 *`, `f7 f11 *`, and `f13 f1 + minmax_scaler` capture combinations that might represent impactful relationships, and additional transformations are applied for complexity (square, tanh, etc.).
   - Logarithmic, reciprocal, cube, and sigmoid transformations (`f14 tanh`, `f9 f13 * sigmoid`, `f14 f13 + cube`) are included to capture non-linear patterns and potential relations that simple interactions might miss.
   - Advanced scaling techniques like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` are used to normalize data, ensuring it's comparable across different features, which might improve modeling robustness.
   - Feature transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and their combinations encourage modeling of more complex relationships beyond linear interactions alone.

3. **Feature Inclusion for Models:**
   - The interaction terms `f13 f9 * tanh`, `f14 f3 * standard_scaler` are devised to capture potentially subtle yet impactful relationships between features, aiding in model complexity and nuanced decision making.

This new feature set leverages transformation methods and interactions to hopefully improve the prediction of successful credit card applications by capturing more complex hidden patterns between features.

The logic behind the combinations:
- Interaction terms: We use interactions like `f1 f8 *`, `f3 f10 *`, `f11 f5 /`, etc., aiming to capture nonlinear relationships that may provide richer information than individual features alone.
- Non-linear transformations: Functions like `tanh`, `log`, `cos`, `sin`, and `sqrt` are employed to introduce non-linearities that help in capturing complex patterns in the data.
- Combination with scaling: Features like `f14 stand_scaler`, `f1 minmax_scaler`, and `f13 f5 minmax_scaler` help rescale data, making the model less sensitive to magnitude-related variability and enhancing learning efficiency.
- Interaction with complex functions: Features like `f14 f10 * tanh`, `f3 cos cube`, and `f1 f3 * sin minmax_scaler` enable more sophisticated pattern discovery by combining transformations with feature interactions.

This approach covers a variety of feature transformations, combinations, and scalings to potentially enhance prediction accuracy for the target task.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 16:54:16,189 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set using the transformations provided, we can combine elements of the two sets you've given. The key is to balance complexity with predictive power, focusing on transformations that are likely to capture non-linear relationships and interactions effectively. Here’s my suggestion for a new feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f7, f8, f9, f10, f12, f13, f14, f1 tanh, f1 sigmoid tanh, f0 cube, f2 cube, f3 square, f5 square, f6 tanh, f7 square, f8 tanh, f9 cube, f10 square, f11 tanh, f13 sin tanh, f14 sigmoid square, f1 cube tanh, f13 cube cube, f3 sigmoid sigmoid, f7 tanh sigmoid, f14 stand_scaler square tanh]
```

Explanation:
- Start with a variety of features, retaining those that appear to provide significant information.
- Retain non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and combinations thereof, which can capture complex relationships.
- Use `cube` and `square` to account for polynomial interactions.
- Include key features from the original dataset that are likely to have a strong impact on the outcome.
- Use scaling (`stand_scaler`, `sigmoid`, etc.) for features that benefit from normalization, ensuring transformations are applied meaningfully based on context.

Remember, these transformations should be validated with a suitable model to ensure they indeed improve predictive performance.

Explanation:
1. **Sigmoid and Stand Scaler**: Functions like sigmoid and standard scaling on gender capture non-linear relationships which are crucial for binary classification. Applying stand_scaler helps normalize the feature further.
2. **Sigmoid and Cube**: Age often interacts in a non-linear fashion with success—applying sigmoid and cube transformations helps in capturing these interactions more effectively.
3. **Stand Scaler and Sigmoid on Marriage feature**: Normalizing and applying sigmoid could help capture complex relationships between marriage status and credit card success.
4. **Log and Tanh**: These transformations on debt and credit score could capture sharp changes or saturation effects crucial for prediction.
5. **Reciprocal and Square**: Applying these transformations to employed (f10) can highlight significant differences between employment levels in terms of credit card success likelihood.
6. **Sqrt and Tanh on Income**: Captures non-linear effects due to income variability on success.
7. **Addition and Standard Scaler**: Combining Gender (f1) and Prior Defaults (f8) to capture interactions and scales for significant patterns.
8. **Multiplication and Cube**: Marriage (f3) with BankCustomer (f5) interaction captures the importance of relationship status with banking habits enhanced by a cubic transformation.

These transformations aim to capture complexities and provide better representation for the downstream prediction task.
