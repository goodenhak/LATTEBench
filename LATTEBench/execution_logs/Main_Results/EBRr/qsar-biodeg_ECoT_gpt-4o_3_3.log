2026-01-17 18:16:24,388 - INFO - llm output = To create a more refined feature set based on the given examples, we will aim to integrate a diversity of transformations and interactions that can help capture complex patterns in the data. The direction will be to incorporate feature interactions via multiplication and division, maintain almost all feature interactions seen in the examples, and simplify some redundant constructions.

Here is an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f21, f24, f26, f27, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f14 minmax_scaler, f38 minmax_scaler, f0 cube, f1 cube, f2 cube, f4 cube, f5 cube, f6 cube, f8 cube, f9 cube, f10 cube, f11 cube, f12 cube, f13 cube, f15 cube, f16 cube, f17 cube, f18 cube, f19 cube, f20 cube, f21 cube, f23 cube, f24 cube, f25 cube, f26 cube, f27 cube, f28 cube, f29 cube, f30 cube, f31 cube, f32 cube, f33 cube, f34 cube, f35 cube, f36 cube, f37 cube, f39 cube, f40 cube, f23 cube, f38 minmax_scaler cube, f40 f14 /, f40 f38 /, f30 square, f30 square f15 -, f15 cos, f30 f14 *, f30 f38 *, f30 f38 * sigmoid, f30 f38 * square, f7 f8 -]
```

**Rationale:**

- We've retained all original features while introducing a variety of transformations (`cube`, `square`, `minmax_scaler`, `sigmoid`, `cos`).
- We included complex interactions like `f40 f14 /`, `f30 f14 *`, `f30 f38 *` which could uncover non-linear relationships important for the classification task.
- Multiplicative interactions like `f30 f38 * sigmoid` and `f30 f38 * square` potentially capture higher-order relationships.
- Continuing to use diverse transformations and operations can help model complex interactions and patterns in the data.
- Interactions such as `f7 f8 -` add to the diversity without overcomplicating the set with repeated multiplicative cube-transformations.

By integrating these considerations, the new feature set aims to capture a broad scope of potential predictive relationships with minimal redundancy.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f22 stand_scaler ,f29 cos ,f14 log ,f38 log ,f0 square ,f1 square ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f5 square ,f6 square ,f8 square ,f9 square ,f10 square ,f11 square ,f12 square ,f13 square ,f16 square ,f17 square ,f18 square ,f19 square ,f20 square ,f21 square ,f23 square ,f24 square ,f25 square ,f26 square ,f27 square ,f28 square ,f30 square ,f31 square ,f32 square ,f33 square ,f34 square ,f35 square ,f36 square ,f37 square ,f39 square ,f40 square ,f7 sqrt square ,f22 stand_scaler square ,f29 cos square ,f14 log square ,f38 log square ,f30 f29 + ,f7 f7 + ,f40 sigmoid]

2026-01-17 18:16:33,257 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, the goal is to create a better feature set by taking advantage of feature transformations and combinations to potentially improve prediction accuracy and capture more complex relationships in the data.

One of the key transformations available is the "square" operation, which can help to capture non-linear relationships. The first feature set example uses this extensively, along with other transformations like 'log' and 'cos', which can also help normalize data and help with non-linear relationships. Additionally, performing arithmetic operations like addition (+) can help create interactions between features.

Here’s a new, better feature set combining elements from the two provided sets and adding some new transformations to explore potential improvements:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 sqrt ,f22 stand_scaler ,f29 cos ,f14 log ,f38 log ,f0 square ,f1 square ,f2 square ,f3 square ,f4 square ,f5 square ,f6 square ,f8 square ,f9 square ,f10 square ,f11 square ,f12 square ,f13 square ,f16 square ,f17 square ,f18 square ,f19 square ,f20 square ,f21 square ,f23 square ,f24 square ,f25 square ,f26 square ,f27 square ,f28 square ,f30 square ,f31 square ,f32 square ,f33 square ,f34 square ,f35 square ,f36 square ,f37 square ,f39 square ,f40 square ,f7 sqrt square ,f22 stand_scaler square ,f29 cos square ,f14 log square ,f38 log square ,f30 f29 + ,f7 f7 + ,f40 sigmoid ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f6 reciprocal ,f18 f37 * ,f23 f24 * ,f17 f31 +]
```

This feature set extends previous ones by including additional feature interactions, the reciprocal transformation which is useful for handling skewed distributions, and a min-max scaler for normalization. The goal of these transformations is to achieve a richer representation of the data, potentially improving model performance by capturing both linear and non-linear relationships more effectively.

Explanation:
1. Introduced scaling and normalizing methods to enhance the transformation of specific features.
2. Added operations that combine sigmoid, tanh, and cube transformations to diversify feature relationships.
3. Integrated subtraction and addition of transformed features to emphasize interactions and potential nonlinear relationships.
4. Continued the use of base features for their individual predictive power alongside new transformations.
5. Enhanced feature diversity by using reciprocal and sqrt operations, potentially useful for improving model predictions on non-linear distributions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

```

This new feature set includes:

1. Square root transformations to address scaling in features.
2. Reciprocal transformations and their reciprocals to highlight inversely proportional relationships.
3. Hyperbolic trigonometric functions such as `tanh` and `cos` to capture non-linearities and periodicity.
4. Combination of original features with transformed versions to introduce interaction terms.
5. Use of both standard and min-max scaling for normalization to reduce feature range.
6. Inclusion of cube transformation for capturing higher complexity patterns.
7. Maintenance of certain operations to ensure the process captures necessary linear and non-linear interactions.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 18:17:26,972 - INFO - llm output = To create a new, potentially better feature set, let's leverage the transformations and combinations provided in the second example while incorporating pertinent features and their operations inspired by both given sets. The goal is to capture useful nonlinearities and interactions:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f6 ,f9 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f21 ,f26 ,f32 ,f35 ,f38 ,f40 ,f0 cos ,f2 cos ,f13 cos ,f17 cos ,f21 cos ,f26 cos ,f35 cos ,f40 cos ,f40 sigmoid ,f3 sqrt ,f22 sqrt ,f9 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f21 quan_trans ,f26 quan_trans ,f32 quan_trans ,f35 quan_trans ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f15 cos ,f22 stand_scaler ,f15 quan_trans ,f0 cube ,f6 reciprocal ,f22 tanh ,f7 f10 minmax_scaler + ,f9 f0 cos * ,f3 f22 sqrt / ,f14 f26 quan_trans * ,f7 f40 cos + ,f2 f40 sqrt -]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Selection and Transformation**: We've retained the key cosine and quantile transformations along with cube and reciprocal operations, as they capture nonlinearities and potential cyclic patterns relevant for molecular characteristics.

2. **Combination and Interaction**:
   - Addition and multiplication of transformed features to capture interactions.
   - New combinations include `f9 f0 cos *` and `f14 f26 quan_trans *` which aim to explore relationships between mass-based, frequency-related features and their transformed counterparts.
   - Division operation, `f3 f22 sqrt /`, enables interaction exploration between sqrt and original scaled features.

3. **Complex Transformations**:
   - Sigmoid and tanh transformations are retained to handle non-linear saturations or activation-like behavior in data patterns. 

By considering these transformations and interactions, the new feature set aims to improve the predictive performance for biodegradability classification, aligning with the mixed and composite feature nature in molecular datasets.

2026-01-17 18:17:34,073 - INFO - llm output = To combine the insights from both examples, the goal is to create a feature set that retains useful transformations and expands the set in a meaningful way. The new feature set should have a variety of operations applied across more features, ensuring the use of operations that capture non-linear relationships and patterns:

- Include basic features to maintain the original context.
- Use a wide variety of mathematical transformations (e.g., cube, cos) over a broad set of features to capture nonlinear patterns.
- Leverage standard scaling to standardize feature ranges.
- Retain unique transformations like `quan_trans` for targeted feature enhancement.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:17:44,012 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, the goal is to use effective transformations, feature scaling, and combinations that could enhance model performance by capturing non-linear relationships or reducing skewness. Using the provided feature sets for reference, I will create a new set with an emphasis on diversity in transformations and ensuring scaled features are included. Here is the new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f7 stand_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt ,f10 log ,f11 quan_trans ,f12 reciprocal ,f13 * f14 ,f20 tanh ,f22 stand_scaler ,f29 cube ,f33 minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
- The **original features** are retained to preserve the raw data that might be inherently informative.
- **Scaled features** (`f7 stand_scaler`, `f8 minmax_scaler`, `f22 stand_scaler`, `f33 minmax_scaler`) ensure standardized input which is especially helpful for algorithms sensitive to feature scale or range.
- **Transformations**:
  - **sqrt** (`f9 sqrt`) and **log** (`f10 log`) reduce skewness in distributions.
  - **quan_trans** (`f11 quan_trans`) helps with normalizing data distribution.
  - **reciprocal** (`f12 reciprocal`) and **tanh** (`f20 tanh`) provide additional nonlinear mappings.
- **Interactions**: Including combinations like `f13 * f14` captures multiplicative interaction effects.
- **Nonlinear transformation** (`f29 cube`) further diversifies the feature space, which might capture important patterns that simple features don't.

This feature set aims to maintain a balance between original features, scaled variants, and nonlinear transformations to maximize predictive performance on downstream tasks.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f15 cos ,f22 stand_scaler ,f15 quan_trans ,f3 sin ,f7 sin ,f9 sin ,f11 sin ,f5 sqrt ,f20 sqrt]
```

In this set:

- We retained the standard scaling and quantile transformation from the second set around `f22` and `f15` for normalization and distribution adjustment benefits.
- We chose a subset of `sin` transformations on potentially periodic or angle-related features assuming their identification (e.g., `f3`, `f7`, `f9`, `f11`) akin to the first given set.
- We added `sqrt` transformations on two features (`f5`, `f20`) that can help in normalizing their scale especially if these features have a skewed distribution. 

This combination uses a mix of feature scaling, periodic transformations, and appropriate normalizations to potentially enhance model learning.

Here is a new feature set:

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f13 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f21 sqrt ,f23 sqrt ,f24 sqrt ,f25 sqrt ,f26 sqrt ,f28 sqrt ,f30 sqrt ,f31 sqrt ,f32 sqrt ,f33 sqrt ,f34 sqrt ,f35 sqrt ,f36 sqrt ,f37 sqrt ,f39 sqrt ,f40 sqrt ,f7 f22 + ,f7 f22 + f7 f22 + +]

2026-01-17 18:18:12,983 - INFO - llm output = To design a better feature set by combining the given two examples, we'll look to incorporate useful transformations that capture essential patterns and relationships in the data, while also considering data distribution adjustments through scaling and normalization processes.

Here's a suggested feature set that merges the strengths of both examples, leveraging their transformations and scalers while introducing some new ones for potentially capturing complex interactions better:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40,
 f0 sqrt ,f1 sqrt ,f2 sqrt ,f3 sqrt ,f4 sqrt ,f5 sqrt ,f6 sqrt ,f8 sqrt ,f9 sqrt ,f10 sqrt ,f12 sqrt ,f13 sqrt ,f16 sqrt ,f17 sqrt ,f18 sqrt ,f19 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f21 sqrt ,f23 sqrt ,f24 sqrt ,f25 sqrt ,f26 sqrt ,f28 sqrt ,f30 sqrt ,f31 sqrt ,f32 sqrt ,f33 sqrt ,f34 sqrt ,f35 sqrt ,f36 sqrt ,f37 sqrt ,f39 sqrt ,f40 sqrt,
 f7 stand_scaler ,f8 minmax_scaler ,f9 sqrt ,f10 log ,f11 quan_trans ,f12 reciprocal ,f13 * f14 ,f20 tanh ,f22 stand_scaler ,f29 cube ,f33 minmax_scaler,
 f7 f22 + f7 f22 + + ,f7 tanh ,f10 sigmoid ,f20 sqrt f22 *]
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Base Features**: Retain all the original features (`f0` to `f40`).
2. **Sqrt Transformations**: Include sqrt transformations of selected features for variance stabilization.
3. **Standard and Min-Max Scaling**: Use `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize features `f7` and `f8`, helping to align their scales for combined feature transformations.
4. **Log and Quantile Transformations**: Apply `log` and `quan_trans` to enhance the separation between classes for certain features.
5. **Reciprocal, Cube, and Multiplication**: Use advanced transformations like `reciprocal` for skew correction and `cube` for more non-linear relationships.
6. **Combining Features**: Maintain combinations like `f7` and `f22` for capturing interactions, and add `f7 tanh`, `f10 sigmoid`, `f20 sqrt f22 *` to evaluate non-linear aspects and feature interactions.
7. **Non-linear Transformations**: Introduce `tanh` and `sigmoid` transformations to capture non-linear relationships among features effectively.

Remember, further evaluation through feature importance or model testing might be needed to validate the effectiveness of these engineered features in improving prediction performance.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set, we:
- Apply a cube transformation to all features, which introduces non-linearity and enriches feature diversity significantly.
- Apply `cos` and `stand_scaler` transformations to all features to provide both cyclical mapping and normalization.
- Add `tanh` transformations to a selection of features known for handling extreme values well.
- Ensure a `quan_trans` operation to one feature for its potential to capture data distribution insights.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:18:32,744 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set that is an improvement based on the provided examples, I'll incorporate elements from both while possibly adding transformations that could further enhance the predictive capacity of the feature set. The second example introduces interactions by subtracting one feature (`f22`) from others and applies transformations like `cube` to a feature. I'll expand upon these ideas, include additional operations that could diversify and potentially deepen the feature set's efficacy for classification tasks.

Here's an improved feature set:

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f12 reciprocal, f16 reciprocal, f17 reciprocal, f21 reciprocal, f26 reciprocal, f30 reciprocal, f35 reciprocal, f36 reciprocal, f7 cube, f22 f7 cube -, f3 f22 -, f11 f22 -, f19 f22 -, f25 f22 -, f30 f22 -, f34 f22 -, f15 cube, f28 cube, f13 sin, f10 log, f21 stand_scaler, f29 minmax_scaler, f38 tanh, f20 sigmoid]
```

**Explanation:**
- I've preserved the reciprocal transformations from the first feature set as they can be useful to highlight relationships where inverses are significant.
- The cube transformation of `f7` is retained, along with interaction terms using `f22` due to the second example, indicating potential importance.
- Additional cube transformations on `f15` and `f28` are included for further non-linear exploration.
- Sin, log, and sigmoid on selected features are introduced to diversify the types of transformations applied, potentially capturing different dynamics of the data.
- Scaling operations (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) help normalize data, making them more comparable and feeding models more effectively.
- Features (`f13`, `f10`, `f38`, `f20`) are transformed using trigonometric, logarithmic, and hyperbolic functions that might resonate differently with the target class, enhancing feature richness.

These transformations aim to capture more complex patterns and relationships, potentially leading to better classification performance.

2026-01-17 18:18:38,792 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature transformations and operations, a better feature set aims to enhance the representation power while considering computational efficiency and the potential for better predictions. Here are some suggestions for a new set:

- Focus on impactful transformations such as logarithms, square roots, and scaling techniques, as these can significantly influence model performance.
- Incorporate trigonometric transformations, like sine and cosine, selectively on features where periodicity or inherent cyclic patterns may be present.
- Use combinations of features through basic arithmetic operations, but ensure these combinations are meaningful and maintain the original context of the data.

Here is the suggested feature set combining these aspects:

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:18:47,778 - INFO - llm output = When generating a new feature set using feature transformation techniques, the goal is to enhance the predictive power of the model by capturing the underlying patterns or relationships within the data. The previous examples you provided include transformations like `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and a lot of `sin` transformations. Here's a more advanced and diverse transformation feature set leveraging a combination of techniques to capture non-linear relationships and scale the data:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f0 log ,f1 sqrt ,f2 reciprocal ,f3 square ,f4 cube ,f5 tanh ,f6 sin ,f7 cos ,f8 sigmoid ,f9 quan_trans ,f10 stand_scaler ,f11 minmax_scaler ,f12 tanh ,f13 reciprocal ,f14 sqrt ,f15 log ,f16 cube ,f17 sin ,f18 cos ,f19 stand_scaler ,f20 minmax_scaler ,f21 reciprocal ,f22 cube ,f23 sqrt ,f24 log ,f25 sigmoid ,f26 sin ,f27 cos ,f28 tanh ,f29 stand_scaler ,f30 minmax_scaler ,f31 reciprocal ,f32 cube ,f33 square ,f34 sqrt ,f35 tanh ,f36 log ,f37 reciprocal ,f38 sin ,f39 cos ,f40 tanh]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Operations**: 
   - Applied trigonometrical functions (`sin`, `cos`) to allow capturing periodic patterns that might be inherent in some features.
   - **`tanh`** and **`sigmoid`** functions to handle nonlinearities with saturation effects, which can be useful for certain distributions in the data.
  
2. **Scaling & Transformation**:
   - **`log`** and **`sqrt`** transformations are used to stabilize variance and handle skewed distributions.
   - **`reciprocal`** helps in transforming highly skewed features, especially where zeros can be avoided or replaced.
   - **`cube`** and **`square`** transformations were added to empower polynomial relationships.

3. **Scaling**:
   - **`stand_scaler`** to center and scale the data, ensuring each feature contributes equally.
   - **`minmax_scaler`** to bring features into a range, which helps neural networks and other models that are sensitive to feature scaling.

4. **Advanced Transformations**:
   - **`quan_trans`** (quantile transformation) is useful for making the data follow a uniform or normal distribution, effective for models that assume Gaussian-like data distribution. 

This new set of features optimizes the diverse range of input transformations that can potentially capture complex patterns or structures inherent in the dataset, beyond what linear relationships can measure.

2026-01-17 18:18:57,262 - INFO - llm output = Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving predictions by transforming and creating features that capture the underlying patterns in the data more effectively. Based on the given feature transformations and operations, you can derive a better feature set considering meaningful transformations and interactions between features.

To create an improved feature set, you can utilize various types of transformations, including scaling, mathematical functions, and interactions. Additionally, focusing on operations that potentially capture important patterns and relationships in the data is essential. Here's a better feature set derived from the two examples provided:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40,

```

### Explanation:
1. **Scaling and Standardization:** Employ stand_scaler and minmax_scaler on features that likely benefit from normalization or scaling, like `f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f4`, `f22`, and `f33`, which help to reduce variance and manage different value ranges.

2. **Mathematical Transformations:** Utilizing log (`f10`), reciprocal (`f18`, `f26`), cube (`f15`, `f29`), and tanh (`f20`, `f17`) captures nonlinear relationships and transformations that might be more influential or interpretable for classification.

3. **Feature Interactions:** Create meaningful interactions that may uncover hidden relationships, such as `f8 minmax_scaler f20 sqrt f22 *` or `f24 tanh f25 minmax_scaler +`. These are designed to establish potential dependencies or amplified effects useful for separating classes.

4. **Complex Operations:** Using combinations of operations intelligently like `f7 stand_scaler f22 + f7 f22 + +` ensures reinforced impactful interactions or aggregated insights that are difficult to capture otherwise.

By combining these approaches, you aim to enhance the predictive power of your model significantly by allowing it to learn from better-represented and processed data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:19:06,099 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set, we can consider adding new transformations or derived features that could capture more complex patterns in the data. Based on the previous examples you provided, here's a new feature set incorporating additional transformations:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f12 reciprocal ,f16 reciprocal ,f17 reciprocal ,f21 reciprocal ,f26 reciprocal ,f30 reciprocal ,f35 reciprocal ,f36 reciprocal ,f22 tanh ,f7 log ,f19 square ,f13 sin ,f25 minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
- **`f22 tanh`**: Retained from the previous example, the hyperbolic tangent might help capture non-linear relationships.
- **`f7 log`**: Applying a logarithmic transformation to `f7` could help normalize the feature or reveal multiplicative relationships.
- **`f19 square`**: Squaring the feature at position `f19` might help in capturing non-linear effects.
- **`f13 sin`**: Applying sine transformation could help in cases where periodic effects or oscillations are present.
- **`f25 minmax_scaler`**: Applying a min-max scaling to move the feature values of `f25` to a specific range, often [0,1], can improve model convergence.

By introducing these additional transformations, we aim to capture more nuanced patterns in the data which could improve the classification performance in predicting the biodegradable classification of chemicals.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:19:15,042 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given examples, we can generate a new feature set that incorporates a mix of original features and transformations, opting to include transformations that can introduce non-linear relationships useful in prediction tasks. Here's a proposed feature set that attempts to strike a balance between variety and complexity:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, 
 f10 log, f13 cosine, f16 cosine, f19 sigmoidal, f22 stand_scaler, f25 quan_trans, 
 f1 f4 minmax_scaler +, f6 f18 tanh +, f9 log f17 *, f22 f37 square /, 
 f14 minmax_scaler, f14 stand_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Original Features**: Retain most original features to preserve the dataset's original information, ensuring that fundamental information is not lost.

2. **Transformations**:
   - **Log** on `f10` and combined with `f17` introduces monotonic relationships that can help in compressing large-scale data.
   - **Cosine** on `f13` and `f16` can help model cyclic behavior or periodicity if present.
   - **Sigmoid** on `f19` can help compress information between 0 and 1, aiding in interpreting probabilities or binary outcomes.
   - **Standard Scaling** on `f22` helps center the data around 0 with unit variance, which is often beneficial for gradient-based models.
   - **Quantile Transformation** on `f25` makes distributions uniform, which can be beneficial for some classifiers.
   - **MinMax Scaling** aggregates features (`f1` and `f4`) to adjust values to a normalized range.
   - **Tanh** combined with another feature for non-linear transformation of values.
   - **Square** applied implies using polynomial terms beneficial for polynomial regression models.

This combined approach uses a diversity of methods to enhance linear as well as non-linear relationships in a flexible way.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Consider using a combination of scaling, non-linear transformations, interactions, and feature derivatives that could aid in capturing nonlinear patterns relevant to the task of classifying chemicals based on their biodegradability.

Here's a proposed feature set using postfix expressions, incorporating some diverse transformations:

 f22 f5 * sqrt ,f1 f2 f6 * +, f21 f34 cube]
```

This feature set embraces a balance of previously used transformations with an emphasis on interactions and non-linear transformations to enhance the predictive power. It includes:

- Retaining the square and log transformations to treat potential nonlinear characteristics of features.
- Using interactive terms like multiplication (*), addition (+), and combining them with functions such as tanh, log, and sigmoid to potentially capture combined and compounded effects of multiple features.
- Incorporating deeper transformations of certain features, such as `cube` and `tanh`, to explore higher-level interactions and nonlinear heights.
- Utilizing `sigmoid`, `minmax_scaler`, and `stand_scaler` to normalize feature scales and enhance modeling capability on scaled variations of the features.

These advanced transformations and interactions could potentially improve the model's ability to learn important patterns associated with biodegradability.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f6 ,f9 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f21 ,f26 ,f32 ,f35 ,f38 ,f40 ,f0 cos ,f2 cos ,f13 cos ,f17 cos ,f21 cos ,f26 cos ,f35 cos ,f40 cos ,f40 sigmoid ,f3 sqrt ,f22 sqrt ,f9 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f21 quan_trans ,f26 quan_trans ,f32 quan_trans ,f35 quan_trans ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f15 cos ,f22 stand_scaler ,f15 quan_trans ,f0 cube ,f6 reciprocal ,f22 tanh ,f7 f10 minmax_scaler + ,f7 f2 cos + ,f7 f21 cos + ,f7 f40 cos + ,f7 f40 sigmoid +]

2026-01-17 18:19:43,117 - INFO - llm output = To generate a feature set that is better than the given examples, I will consider using a combination of transformations that can enhance predictive power and interpretability. 

Given the available operations, we should particularly focus on those that could introduce non-linearity, normalize, and reduce dimensionality, while maintaining valuable information. Here's a suggested transformation:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f15 cos ,f22 stand_scaler ,f15 quan_trans ,f3 sin ,f7 sin ,f9 sin ,f11 sin ,f5 sqrt ,f20 sqrt ,f14 stand_scaler ,f38 stand_scaler ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f3 log ,f22 reciprocal ,f40 tanh ,f5 f10 sqrt + ,f3 f11 log * ,f7 f20 sqrt -]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Normalization and Standardization:** Using both `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` helps to manage different scales and distributions effectively.
   
2. **Non-linear transformations:** Operations like `sin`, `cos`, `tanh`, `log`, and `sqrt` can capture non-linear patterns that may be useful for classification.

3. **Feature Interactions:** We've included interactions (`+`, `*`, `-`) between different transformed features to capture combined effects.

This combination should provide a rich feature set capable of deriving insightful patterns crucial for classifying the biodegradability of chemicals.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

### Key Modifications:
1. **Square Root Transformations**: Applied square root transformations broadly to help stabilize variance and reduce skewness.
2. **Square & Reciprocal**: Retained squared transformations for maintaining relationships and added reciprocal for normalization and handling larger ranges.
3. **Log Transform**: Introduced a log transformation for logarithmic scaling, aiding in variance reduction for features with wide numeric ranges.
4. **Tanh Transform**: Used tanh transformation for smooth scaling between [-1, 1], helping in nonlinear feature interactions.
5. **Significant Sine & Sigmoid Transforms**: Enhanced the non-linear transformations with sine and sigmoid functions, offering robust interactions and capturing complex relationships.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:19:55,877 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, the second feature set introduces a comprehensive range of transformations, including quadratic expansions (squares of multiple features), which can capture non-linear relationships more effectively. It also combines several features using addition and multiplication operations, potentially introducing interactions between features. To create an even better feature set, we can add some additional transformations while ensuring we keep the complexity manageable:

```

In this improved feature set:
- Additional interactions are created between selected features using multiplication, promoting High order interactions.
- Add `tanh` transformations and operations like `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` to further refine feature scaling.
- Retain fundamental transformations like `log`, `sqrt`, `square`, and some nonlinear transformations like `cos` and `sigmoid`. These can help in capturing complex patterns.
- Ensure scalability by balancing between complexity and computational feasibility, especially with features that are likely to be strongly related to the target classification.

2026-01-17 18:20:00,496 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided examples, the latter feature set has fewer features but introduces new transformations like the square root and cosine function, along with standardized scaling. To improve upon these examples, it’s important to consider variability, information retention, and potential signal enhancement for the classification task. Below is a better feature set inspired by the two examples:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f7 sqrt, f22 stand_scaler, f29 cos, f7 log, f22 tanh, f29 reciprocal, f1 minmax_scaler, f11 sigmoid, f35 sin]
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Transformations to Enhance Signal:**
   - **Logarithm (`f7 log`)** and **Reciprocal (`f29 reciprocal`)**: These operations can help manage skewness and amplify or reduce feature influencing power.

2. **Standardization and Scaling:**
   - **MinMax Scaling on `f1`** and **Standard Scaling continued (`f22 stand_scaler`)** ensure comparability in features of differing magnitudes.

3. **Trigonometric Operaitons:**
   - **Cosine (`f29 cos`)**, **Sin (`f35 sin`)**: Captures periodic relationships which might be a non-linear relationship for classification.
  
4. **Tanh and Sigmoid (`f22 tanh`, `f11 sigmoid`)**: Both compress outputs into a small range that may reflect non-linear category separation potential.

2026-01-17 18:20:06,602 - INFO - llm output = Here's a proposed improved feature set, combining the more promising transformations from the two given examples and adding some different transformations to improve the model's ability to distinguish between classes:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f12 reciprocal, f16 reciprocal, f17 reciprocal, f21 reciprocal, f26 reciprocal, f30 reciprocal, f35 reciprocal, f36 reciprocal, f22 tanh, f7 log, f13 sigmoid, f19 square, f5 sqrt, f25 minmax_scaler, f8 quant_trans, f18 cube]
```

### Key Additional Transformations:
1. **f5 sqrt**: Square root transformation could help normalize skewed distributions or emphasize differences in smaller values.
2. **f8 quant_trans**: Quantile transformation can make the feature distribution more normal, which may improve the model's performance on certain types of data.
3. **f18 cube**: Cubing may enhance features where large magnitudes might be more informative.
4. **f13 sigmoid**: This transformation shifts values to the [0,1] range, potentially useful to map continuous variables into probabilities. 

Incorporating these transformations should enhance the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data, thereby improving prediction accuracy for biodegradable classification.

- **Min-Max Scaling:** Helps in normalizing features to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1), making it easier for some algorithms to converge.
- **Standard Scaling:** Centers and scales the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
- **Non-linear Transformations:** Such as `cos`, `sqrt`, `tanh`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and `sigmoid` which can help in capturing complex relationships between variables.
- **Quantile Transformation:** Often used to make the data more Gaussian-like, which can be beneficial for certain models.

By combining these varied transformations and scalings, we improve the representational power of the dataset and allow models to potentially capture a wider range of patterns and relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f6 ,f9 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f21 ,f26 ,f32 ,f35 ,f38 ,f40 ,f0 cos ,f2 cos ,f13 cos ,f17 cos ,f21 cos ,f26 cos ,f35 cos ,f40 cos ,f40 sigmoid ,f3 sqrt ,f22 sqrt ,f9 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f21 quan_trans ,f26 quan_trans ,f32 quan_trans ,f35 quan_trans ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f15 cos ,f22 stand_scaler ,f15 quan_trans ,f0 cube ,f6 reciprocal ,f22 tanh ,f7 f10 minmax_scaler + ,f7 f2 cos + ,f7 f21 cos + ,f7 f40 cos + ,f7 f40 sigmoid +]

2026-01-17 18:20:18,431 - INFO - llm output = Based on the given feature set examples, let's formulate a new feature set that incorporates valuable transformations and combinations considering both examples provided:

```
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f6 ,f9 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f21 ,f26 ,f32 ,f35 ,f38 ,f40 ,f0 cos ,f2 cos ,f13 cos ,f17 cos ,f21 cos ,f26 cos ,f35 cos ,f40 cos ,f40 sigmoid ,f3 sqrt ,f22 sqrt ,f9 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f21 quan_trans ,f26 quan_trans ,f32 quan_trans ,f35 quan_trans ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f15 cos ,f22 stand_scaler ,f15 quan_trans ,f0 cube ,f6 reciprocal ,f22 tanh ,f7 f10 minmax_scaler + ,f9 f0 cos * ,f3 f22 sqrt / ,f14 f26 quan_trans * ,f7 f40 cos + ,f2 f40 sqrt - ,f2 f9 * ,f13 f0 cube / ,f22 f6 reciprocal * ,f32 f9 quan_trans +]
```

Here, keeping the format consistent with the examples, additional combinations and interactions between features that seem potentially valuable are added:

- **Feature Interaction**: `f2 f9 *` creates a product that explores an interaction between `f2` and `f9`.
- **Feature Transformation**: `f13 f0 cube /` utilizes the cube transformation of `f0` for normalization against `f13`, exploring their relationships.
- **Feature Scaling**: `f22 f6 reciprocal *` combines reciprocal transformation of `f6` with `f22`, potentially enhancing modeling for features that differ widely in scale.
- **Blended Transformation**: `f32 f9 quan_trans +` accumulates transformed values of `f32` and `f9`, which could better differentiate the chemical's behavior regarding biodegradability.

These operations aim to introduce non-linear interactions and broaden the possibility space for learning complex patterns that might be indicative of the chemical classification task.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:20:26,329 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, we can create a new feature set that incorporates insights from both examples while aiming to enhance the prediction model. Here's a new feature set that balances extensive transformations with a focus on potentially useful insights:

```plaintext

```

### Key Considerations:
- **Cube Transformations:** Retained from the second example because non-linear transformations can reveal complex relationships between variables and the target.
- **Cosine Transformations:** Using cosine transformations on selected features like `f0, f2`, and others from both examples as they can help capture periodic or symmetric patterns.
- **Square Root Transformations:** Added new square root transformations on a few features to help normalize and reduce the variance in features with skewed distributions.
- **Standard Scaler:** Standard scaling for specific features to ensure different scales do not impact the model's performance adversely.
- **Quantile Transformation:** Applied on `f38` to transform the distribution of the data to be more Gaussian-like, which can be beneficial for many machine learning models.
  
The new feature set aims to provide a balanced enhancement by strengthening data representation with a diverse set of transformations without excessive complexity.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 18:20:37,626 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the provided examples, consider combining meaningful interactions between features while still incorporating complex transformations:

``` 
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f12 reciprocal, f16 reciprocal, f17 reciprocal, f21 reciprocal, f26 reciprocal, f30 reciprocal, f35 reciprocal, f36 reciprocal, f7 cube, f22 f7 cube -, f3 f22 -, f11 f22 -, f19 f22 -, f25 f22 -, f30 f22 -, f34 f22 -, f15 cube, f28 cube, f13 sin, f10 log, f21 stand_scaler, f29 minmax_scaler, f38 tanh, f20 sigmoid, f13 cos, f31 square, f23 f33 *, f18 f40 /, f14 tanh, f8 f13 +, f21 f38 *, f10 log f35 +, f5 sqrt, f6 quant_trans]
```

In this improved feature set:
- Additional trigonometric and logarithmic functions (`cos`, `tanh`) are applied to explore nonlinear relationships.
- Cubing and reciprocal operations are used for transformation within existing features (`f7 cube`, `f12 reciprocal`, etc.).
- Interaction effects are created between features using multiplication and division (`f23 f33 *`, `f18 f40 /`).
- Feature scaling techniques like `stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`, and `quant_trans` are applied to standardize features.
- The use of addition and subtraction facilitates the creation of compound features that might represent key interactions (`f8 f13 +`, `f10 log f35 +`).

This approach aims to derive complex but informative features that capture both scale transformations and interactions that could lead to better prediction outcomes in a classification model.

### Key Changes and Additions:
1. Retained useful transformations such as `square`, `reciprocal`, `sqrt`, and `log` for individual scaling.
2. Retained different types of scaling (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`) for normalization.
3. Introduced `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cos` for non-linear transformations.
4. Included mathematical operations: addition (`+`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) to allow feature interactions.
5. Expanded cube transformations to include additional original features, leveraging the non-linearity suitable for modeling complex relationships.
6. Selected specific features for `quan_trans` and `stand_scaler` based on potential variance and spread.

These selected operations and transformations aim to enrich the feature space with diverse transformations while preserving computational feasibility, potentially enhancing model performance in capturing the underlying patterns necessary for the classification task.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f13 ,f14 ,f15 ,f16 ,f17 ,f18 ,f19 ,f20 ,f21 ,f22 ,f23 ,f24 ,f25 ,f26 ,f27 ,f28 ,f29 ,f30 ,f31 ,f32 ,f33 ,f34 ,f35 ,f36 ,f37 ,f38 ,f39 ,f40 ,f0 reciprocal ,f1 reciprocal ,f12 reciprocal ,f16 reciprocal ,f17 reciprocal ,f21 reciprocal ,f26 reciprocal ,f30 reciprocal ,f35 reciprocal ,f36 reciprocal ,f22 tanh]

2026-01-17 18:21:10,498 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set that incorporates the insights from the given examples, we can focus on extending the transformations that could potentially capture more complex patterns in the data. In the latter example provided, an additional transformation (`f13 sigmoid`) was applied. We can further enhance this by considering additional transformations for other features or combinations of features. Here's an improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, f26, f27, f28, f29, f30, f31, f32, f33, f34, f35, f36, f37, f38, f39, f40, f0 reciprocal, f1 reciprocal, f12 reciprocal, f16 reciprocal, f17 reciprocal, f21 reciprocal, f26 reciprocal, f30 reciprocal, f35 reciprocal, f36 reciprocal, f22 tanh, f13 sigmoid, f14 cube, f18 log, f19 minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
- **`f14 cube`**: Cubing a feature can help capture polynomials of higher degrees, which can be beneficial if there are nonlinear relationships not captured by the original features.
- **`f18 log`**: Applying a logarithmic transformation to certain features can normalize the distribution, especially if there are features (like counts) that have a long tail.
- **`f19 minmax_scaler`**: Scaling a feature to a particular range can improve the performance of some algorithms, especially distance-based methods.
  
These transformations are chosen to provide a diverse set of features that can uncover potential nonlinear relationships or improve model performance by making the data more suitable for certain algorithms or improving numerical stability.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f6 ,f9 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f21 ,f26 ,f32 ,f35 ,f38 ,f40 ,f0 cos ,f2 cos ,f13 cos ,f17 cos ,f21 cos ,f26 cos ,f35 cos ,f40 cos ,f40 sigmoid ,f3 sqrt ,f22 sqrt ,f9 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f21 quan_trans ,f26 quan_trans ,f32 quan_trans ,f35 quan_trans ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f15 cos ,f22 stand_scaler ,f15 quan_trans ,f0 cube ,f6 reciprocal ,f22 tanh ,f7 f10 minmax_scaler + ,f9 f0 cos * ,f3 f22 sqrt / ,f14 f26 quan_trans * ,f7 f40 cos + ,f2 f40 sqrt -]

2026-01-17 18:21:18,973 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two provided feature sets, the goal is to derive a new feature set that improves upon both. Here is an optimized feature set created by incorporating key transformations and operations observed in both examples, while introducing some additional useful combinations:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f5, f7, f9, f11, f13, f14, f16, f18, f19, f20, f21, f22, f26, f29, f30, f35, f36, f38, f40,

 f14 reciprocal, f5 log, f2 tanh, f18 sigmoid, 
 f10 f6 +, f9 f0 cos *, f3 f22 sqrt /, 
 f14 f26 quan_trans *, f11 f30 sin +, f9 f7 sqrt -, 
 f13 f1 /, f11 f9 f6 * +]
```

In this feature set:
- Basic transformations like `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `sqrt`, `sin`, and `tanh` are applied to selected features based on their potential to normalize or activate latent patterns.
- Feature interactions like `f10 f6 +` and `f9 f0 cos *` are included to account for non-linear relationships between variables.
- More elaborate transformations are created by combining operations, such as `f9 f7 sqrt -` and `f13 f1 /`, which can help capture the interactions and dependencies between molecular descriptors. 

By refining these feature combinations, this set aims to capture both linear and non-linear patterns while scaling or transforming features as needed, optimizing the information available for the classification task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f6 ,f9 ,f13 ,f14 ,f16 ,f17 ,f21 ,f26 ,f32 ,f35 ,f38 ,f40 ,f0 cos ,f2 cos ,f13 cos ,f17 cos ,f21 cos ,f26 cos ,f35 cos ,f40 cos ,f40 sigmoid ,f3 sqrt ,f22 sqrt ,f9 quan_trans ,f13 quan_trans ,f17 quan_trans ,f21 quan_trans ,f26 quan_trans ,f32 quan_trans ,f35 quan_trans ,f0 minmax_scaler ,f14 minmax_scaler ,f38 minmax_scaler ,f15 cos ,f22 stand_scaler ,f15 quan_trans ,f0 cube ,f6 reciprocal ,f22 tanh ,f7 f10 minmax_scaler + ,f9 f0 cos * ,f3 f22 sqrt / ,f14 f26 quan_trans * ,f7 f40 cos + ,f2 f40 sqrt - ,f2 f9 * ,f13 f0 cube / ,f22 f6 reciprocal * ,f32 f9 quan_trans +]

2026-01-17 18:21:27,159 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set considering the provided examples, we'll aim to combine the stronger aspects of both feature sets while optimizing for transformations that are likely to improve model performance. Here's a new feature set suggestion:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f6, f9, f13, f14, f16, f17, f21, f26, f32, f35, f38, f40,
 f0 cos, f2 cos, f13 cos, f17 cos, f21 cos, f26 cos, f35 cos, f3 sqrt, f22 sqrt, 
 f9 quan_trans, f13 quan_trans, f17 quan_trans, f32 quan_trans, f22 tanh, 
 f0 log, f1 sqrt, f2 cube, f6 reciprocal, f9 f10 /, f14 f26 quan_trans *,

 f2 f9 *, f3 f4 *, f14 f38 minmax_scaler *, f7 f22 +]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Basic Transformations**: Retain the original features (`f0`, `f1`, etc.) as they form the basis of input data.
2. **Trigonometric Transformations**: Keep cosine transformations (`f0 cos`, `f2 cos`, etc.) and add sine (`f21 sin`), as trigonometric functions can be crucial for capturing periodic or oscillatory behaviors.
3. **Root and Exponential Transformations**: Maintain key root and power transformations (`f3 sqrt`, `f2 cube`) to explore nonlinear relationships.
4. **Logarithmic and Reciprocal Transformations**: These aid in scale normalization and transformations to handle skewness (`f0 log`, `f6 reciprocal`).
5. **Advanced Scaling and Encoding Techniques**: Continue using scalers and quantile transformations for normalization and distribution adjustment (`f9 quan_trans`, `f38 minmax_scaler`).
6. **Functional Combinations**: Combine features using operations that could help capture complex interactions (`f9 f10 /`, `f7 f40 cos +`, `f14 f26 quan_trans *`), which are a major source of non-linear relationships.
7. **Nonlinear Activation Functions**: Include nonlinear activations (`f22 tanh`, `f19 sigmoid`) to introduce complex non-linearities.
8. **Feature Interactions and Expansions**: Use multiplications and additions to dynamically interact features (`f35 f36 +`, `f7 f22 +`), capturing synergies between different aspects of the data.

This new feature set balances direct use, transformations, and feature interactions, offering a more comprehensive and flexible approach for downstream tasks like classification or regression.

Answer: 1.0

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set maintains the transformations seen as potentially valuable (such as reciprocal, square, log, minmax scaling) and enhances by adding cubes and square roots applied to a few features to capture nonlinearity and interaction effects. Additionally, square and tanh transformations are used strategically between features to explore capturing complex patterns within the data.
