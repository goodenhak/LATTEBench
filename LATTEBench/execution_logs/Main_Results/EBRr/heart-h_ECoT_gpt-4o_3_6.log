you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-19 20:08:57,672 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set further, I'm going to combine beneficial transformations from both of the given feature sets, while also adding some new transformations. The goal is to increase the expressive power of the transformations, exploit potential non-linear relationships, and leverage normalization/scaling for any numerical stability improvements. Here's the refined feature set:

```
[f0 minmax_scaler, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f5 minmax_scaler, f6 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f11 minmax_scaler, f12 minmax_scaler, f3 sqrt minmax_scaler, f7 sqrt minmax_scaler, f4 square, f10 sqrt, f2 f8 *, f9 f4 f0 * *, f6 sqrt f10 * sigmoid, f2 sqrt f3 cube sqrt *, f4 reciprocal f2 sqrt *, f9 f8 sqrt * f9 f8 sqrt * * quan_trans, f10 sqrt f1 *, f9 sqrt f4 minmax_scaler *, f2 sqrt f4 f0 * *, f7 cube sqrt f2 *]
```

### Explanation:

- **Scaling and Normalization:** Using `minmax_scaler` on the original features (f0, f1, f2, etc.) and their transformations ensures they are scaled to a range, which is important for certain algorithms sensitive to the scale.

- **Higher Order Interactions:** Terms like `f2 f8 *` and `f4 f0 * f2 sqrt *` create interaction terms that could capture the combined effects of multiple features.

- **Log Transformation & Sqrt Scaling:** Transformations like `f3 sqrt` and `f4 reciprocal` help in managing skewed distributions and transforming data to approximate normal distribution, enhancing linear model performance.

- **Exponential and Trigonometric Functions:** Using functions like `cube`, `sqrt`, and `sigmoid` allows you to capture non-linear relationships.

- **Quantile Transformation:** The transformation `f9 f8 sqrt * f9 f8 sqrt * * quan_trans` helps even out the distribution of the data.

This approach will provide a diverse and potent array of features that should feed into downstream predictive models effectively, improving prediction accuracy for heart disease presence in patients.

2026-01-19 20:09:09,944 - INFO - llm output = To improve predictions for the presence of heart disease, we should focus on generating features that capture meaningful interactions and transformations of existing features. Let's combine elements from both given feature sets and introduce new transformations to further enhance prediction capabilities.

Feature Set:

1. Original Features: [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12]

2. Interaction and Transformation Examples:

   - f3 f4 +: Sum of resting blood pressure and cholesterol.
   - f7 f4 +: Sum of maximum heart rate and cholesterol.
   
   - f3 reciprocal: Reciprocal of resting blood pressure.
   - f7 reciprocal: Reciprocal of maximum heart rate.
   
   - f3 f4 + reciprocal: Reciprocal of the sum of resting blood pressure and cholesterol.
   - f7 f4 + reciprocal: Reciprocal of the sum of maximum heart rate and cholesterol.

3. New Enhanced Features:

   - f2 tanh: Tanh transformation of chest pain type, capturing non-linear effects.
   - f9 f10 /: Ratio of ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest over slope of peak exercise ST segment, possibly capturing the strength and impact of exercise on heart health.
   - f0 f1 *: Interaction between age and sex, which might show demographic effects on heart disease.
   - f6 sin: Sin transformation of resting electrocardiographic results, emphasizing periodic abnormalities.
   - f12 log: Log transformation of thal (type of defect) to reduce skewness in this feature.
   - f9 f0 minmax_scaler +: Using minimum-maximum scaler on ST depression combined with age for normalization and interaction effects.
   - f4 sqrt f7 max: Maximum of squared cholesterol and maximum heart rate, emphasizing extremes in patient metabolic indices.

The above transformations aim to capture complex interactions and normalized versions of original data features while introducing non-linearities to better model the potential presence of heart disease. This enhanced feature set should contribute to improved predictive capabilities of the model.

**Explanation and Strategy**:
- **Keep Original Features:** We keep the numerical features (`f2`, `f7`, `f8`, `f9`, `f10`) as they provide essential baseline information.
- **Nonlinear Transformations:** Incorporate `square`, `cos`, and `log` transformations, as they are common practices for capturing nonlinear relationships with potential predictive power.
- **Combination Transformations:** Explore combinations of features with operations like addition and subsequent transformations (`log`, `cos`) to capture potential interactive effects or new patterns.
- **Efficient Composition:** Avoid excessive nested operations to maintain interpretability and computational efficiency while still exploring deeper transformations when potentially impactful (e.g., `f9 log`, `f8 f3 + log`).

This set aims to balance both simple transformations and deeper interactions, targeting a robust feature set that can model complex underlying patterns.

2026-01-19 20:09:33,321 - INFO - llm output = When evaluating feature sets for predictive tasks like determining the presence of heart disease, especially with complex operations involved, the goal is typically to create features that will enhance model performance by capturing underlying patterns or relationships more robustly.

To improve upon the provided feature sets, we need to ensure greater capture of variance, potential interaction effects, and normalization for model compatibility. Combining transformations that handle non-linearity, smoothen variability, and enhance interpretability would be beneficial.

Here is a refined feature set inspired by the examples given:

```plaintext
[f0 ,f1 ,f2 ,f3 ,f4 ,f5 ,f6 ,f7 ,f8 ,f9 ,f10 ,f11 ,f12 ,f3 sqrt log ,f7 cube sqrt ,f2 f8 sqrt * minmax_scaler ,f3 reciprocal log ,f4 f0 * sqrt ,f9 f8 sqrt * log ,f10 f1 sqrt * tanh]
```

Explanation:
1. **Log and sqrt transformations** on specific features help in handling skewness and can accentuate meaningful variance for predictive tasks.
2. **Interaction terms** like `f2 f8 sqrt * minmax_scaler` consider compound effects between features after normalizing, counteracting scale effects without losing relationships.
3. **Cube and reciprocal transformations** capture higher-order interactions and inverse relations, potential keys in modeling intricate relations.
4. **Tanh and other nonlinear scalers** help in ameliorating extremes and calibrating feature impact systematically,
   especially influential in dealing with medical data complexity. 

These transformations should enhance the predictive power compared to the simpler transformations in the earlier examples.

Additionally, we should aim to incorporate techniques that handle missing values effectively and standardize the data for better model performance. Here's an improved feature set based on the given examples:

```

```

### Additional Suggestions:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Consider applying imputation techniques for missing values before scaling or transformation to ensure the features are utilized effectively.
- **Feature Interactions:** Explore polynomial combinations and interactions between features (e.g., age with cholesterol levels) using multiplicative or additive operations.
- **Nonlinear Transformations:** Using operations like `sigmoid`, `tanh`, or `log` can help in capturing nonlinear relationships.
- **Feature Selection:** Use domain knowledge or statistical tests to select the most relevant features post-transformation.

These enhancements should yield a more informative feature set that can improve model predictions for heart disease.

2026-01-19 20:10:23,884 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we should aim to create new features that might capture more complex patterns in the data, yet remain manageable in number so they can contribute meaningfully to the prediction task. The initial example is quite exhaustive, applying transformations extensively, while the second example is more minimalistic, focusing on a few transformations.

Let's aim for a balanced approach by choosing meaningful transformations that could enhance model prediction:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, 
 f1 cube, f4 cube, f7 cube,           # Cubes for capturing non-linear relationships
 f3 square, f7 square,                # Squares for capturing non-linear relationships
 sqrt f1, sqrt f2, sqrt f3, sqrt f4,  # Square roots for variance reduction
 reciprocal f3,                       # Reciprocal for dealing with potential skewness
 f2 stand_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler,   # Scaling to standardize features
 sigmoid f9,                          # Non-linear transformation to map values to a bounded range
 f3 f7 +, f3 f3 +]                    # Feature interactions for capturing combined effects
```

This feature set creates non-linearity through cubes and squares, achieves normalization and scaling for better prediction performance, and introduces useful feature interactions. Adjustments are made by evaluating the importance of features and ensuring that valuable transformations are not omitted, yet maintaining simplicity to avoid overfitting.

### Explanation:
1. **Normalization and Scaling**: I kept the original approach of scaling using min-max scalers for individual features.
2. **Non-linear Interactions**: I'm introducing combinations and transformations capturing non-linear relations (squared, cubed roots, reciprocals).
3. **Complex Interactions**: Products & functions of interactions (e.g., `f9 sqrt f4 minmax_scaler *`) are retained and extended (as new potential meaningful interactions).
4. **Sigmoid & Tanh**: I used the `sigmoid` and `tanh` functions as they are particularly useful for bounding values and capturing non-linearity, respectively.
5. **Aggregation Transformations**: With transformations like `sqrt`, `cube`, and combinations of these, we're capable of uncovering potential hidden patterns in the data.

The result should introduce diverse representations to better serve predictive modeling, especially for models sensitive to non-linear features like tree-based or neural networks.

Explanation:

1. **Basic Features**: Include all original features (f0 to f12) to ensure baseline information is preserved.

2. **Square Root Transformation**: `f4 f4 sqrt +` This feature potentially captures the nature of features that respond non-linearly, emphasizing f4 transformation.

3. **Multiplicative Interaction**: `f3 f7 *` and `f7 f3 *` provide interactions that can capture the effect of linked biometric features, which might affect disease presence.

4. **Reciprocal Transformation**: `f9 reciprocal` helps in linearizing features that have inverse relationships influencing the target.

5. **Scaling and Normalization**: Using `minmax_scaler` and `stand_scaler` on more relevant features (such as `f2`, `f6 f4 stand_scaler +`) ensures that features are comparable and consistent in scales, enhancing the model’s ability to extract patterns.

6. **Log Transformation**: Apply `log` to `f6`, `f7`, `f9` to handle skewed data distributions more effectively, capturing multiplicative effects efficiently.

7. **Advanced Non-Linear Transformation**: `f11 tanh` captures complex interactions in a bounded hyperbolic tangent form. 

8. **Feature Interaction and Complexity Enhancements**: `f8 f10 stand_scaler *` and `f5 cube square` add an element of cross-feature influence and further non-linear combination exploration, enhancing the possibility of capturing unseen interactions of numerous biometrics pertinent to heart disease presence.

Overall, these transformations aim to provide the model with a rich set of engineered features, ensuring diverse aspects influencing disease presence are analyzed effectively in downstream tasks.

```

Explanation:
- I added interaction terms such as `f0 f2 f4 * *`, which interact the min-max scaled age, chest_pain, and cholesterol levels, potentially capturing more complex non-linear relationships.
- Logarithms of some variables (`f3 log minmax_scaler`, `f10 log`) are used for variance stabilization and to handle potential skewness.
- Additional standardization (`f12 f5 sqrt * stand_scaler`) serves to ensure that composite features remain within scale, hence preventing some dominant feature from skewing predictive models.
- Further polynomial relationships and mixed interactions are introduced, such as `f8 f12 sqrt *` and `f6 f7 +`, intended to capture diverse depictions of dependencies within the data.
- Inclusion of hyperbolic tan (`f9 tanh`) and similar transformations enhances the range of non-linear transformations, providing flexibility in learning intricate patterns.

2026-01-19 20:11:35,161 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided feature set examples, the goal is to create a better feature set for predicting the presence of heart disease. The new feature set should improve the representation and predictive power by combining, transforming, or scaling the existing features. Here is an improved feature set using the postfix expression format:

1. Build foundational features:
   - f2, f7, f8, f9, f10 from the existing features which have shown usefulness in prior sets.

2. Create transformed features that can capture nonlinear relationships or interactions:
   - f9 log (log transformation to explore the logarithmic relationship)
   - f7 square (to capture second-order relationships)
   - f4 + reciprocal f8 + f6 + f5 + (interactions among several factors which could highlight compound effects on heart disease)

3. Scaled and standardized transformations:
   - f2 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler (standardize features for uniformity in scale)
   - f10 minmax_scaler (scale features for range-bound transformations)

4. Feature interactions and composites:
   - f7 f10 square + log (combination of squared and log, potentially useful in nonlinear feature interaction)
   - f4 + reciprocal f2 + f6 + f1 * cube (capturing multi-way interactions with cube transformation)

5. Explore mathematical transformations:
   - f0 cos cos (capturing periodic patterns using cosine transformation)
   - f8 f9 * log (multiplying log transformed features for multiplicative interactions)
   - f3 f7 + tanh (combining features with hyperbolic tangent for nonlinear smoothing)

The new feature set is:
- [f2, f7, f8, f9, f10, f9 log, f7 square, f4 + reciprocal f8 + f6 + f5 +, f2 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f7 f10 square + log, f4 + reciprocal f2 + f6 + f1 * cube, f0 cos cos, f8 f9 * log, f3 f7 + tanh]

**Explanation**:
1. **Polynomials**: Including cubic and square transformations for each feature can help capture non-linear relationships that linear transformations might miss.
2. **Interaction terms**: Combining features through addition and multiplication allows us to capture potential interactions between features.
3. **Mathematical transformations**: Functions like sqrt, sin, cos, tanh, log, and reciprocal are useful for further enhancing non-linear relationships and variability in the data.
4. **Scaling**: Standard scaling, min-max scaling, and quantile transformation can help with normalizing data, potentially improving the performance of certain models sensitive to data scale (like k-NN or SVM).
5. **Sigmoid function**: Applying the sigmoid function to one of the features can highlight features within a bounded range, which might help stabilize large disparities in values.

The intention is to provide a comprehensive feature set that offers diverse transformations likely to improve model performance by capturing linear and non-linear aspects of the features, as well as interactions between them.

2026-01-19 20:12:04,331 - INFO - llm output = For your feature engineering task, we're aiming to create a more effective set of derived features using the functions and operations provided. The goal is to select transformations that potentially capture non-linear relationships, interactions, or scale adjustments that improve model performance for predicting heart disease presence. Based on the feature sets provided and prioritizing useful transformations and diversity in representations, here's a refined set of features:

```
[f1, f2, f9, f10, f4, f7, f1 f2 *, f2 f9 *, f9 f10 *, f7 f7 *, f8 f8 +, f9 f9 +, f10 f10 +, f1 minmax_scaler, f2 minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f7 minmax_scaler sin, f2 minmax_scaler cos, f9 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f10 minmax_scaler minmax_scaler minmax_scaler, f9 minmax_scaler tanh, f7 minmax_scaler reciprocal, f4 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f2 sqrt sin, f10 sqrt cos, f7 square, f1 f1 square, f2 f2 square sin, f9 f9 square cos, f7 cube tanh]
```

In this feature set:
- We utilize basic arithmetic combinations (`f1 f2 *`) and self-multiplications (`f7 f7 *`).
- We apply min-max scaling to normalize the features and further transformations like sine and cosine to explore cyclical patterns.
- The use of `sqrt`, `square`, and `cube` helps model non-linearity.
- `reciprocal` and `tanh` can introduce non-linear transformations valuable in capturing complex relationships.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 20:12:11,957 - INFO - llm output = In the context of feature engineering for a machine learning model predicting heart disease, I've analyzed the given postfix expressions for generating feature sets. The goal is to create a more informative feature set. The provided expressions rely on mathematical operations and transformations that are commonly used to enhance the predictive power of raw features.

Here is an improved feature set combining elements from the examples provided while ensuring transformations that are likely beneficial for capturing complex relationships within the data:

```
[f7 f2 + square , f3 f2 + f8 f10 + * , f2 f8 / , f9 tanh , f8 sqrt , f3 f2 + f8 * f10 + , f7 square f3 f10 + / , f7 f2 + f9 f10 * * , f2 sqrt f8 sqrt * f7 - , f3 f2 sin f8 cos * , f9 square f10 + , log f2 , log f8 , minmax_scaler f7 , stand_scaler f9 , quan_trans f10]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Combining Simple Arithmetic Operations:** Expressions like `f7 f2 + square` combine two features and apply a square transformation. This can help in modeling non-linear relationships between the original features.

2. **Interaction Features:** Using interactions such as `f3 f2 + f8 f10 + *` helps capture potential dependencies between multiple features which might not be evident when considering them individually.

3. **Transformations:** Operations such as `sqrt`, `log`, and `tanh` are intuitive transformations for normalizing or emphasizing certain patterns, like diminishing the impact of large values or emphasizing ratios, respectively.

4. **Data Normalization:** Applying `minmax_scaler` or `stand_scaler` standardizes features to comparable ranges, aiding learning algorithms in converging more effectively.

5. **Quantile Transformation:** `quan_trans f10` can help model the underlying distribution of data, making features more robust to outliers or skewed distributions.

The goal is to enhance the feature set to maximize its predictive power using a mix of scaling, transformations, and interaction terms. 

Here is the improved feature set:

```

### Explanation of New Features:
- **Interaction Terms:** Introducing more interaction terms such as `f0 f1 f6 * *`, `f2 f9 f7 * *`, `f4 sqrt f10 f11 * *` can help in capturing joint influences of features.
- **Non-linear Transformations:** Features like `tanh`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `sigmoid` are used to model non-linearities which could be crucial for capturing complex relationships.
- **Advanced Scaling and Aggregations:** Combining operations like `sqrt`, `log`, and `minmax_scaler` for complex non-linear transformations and scaling of interaction features can help standardize while also preserving non-linear relationships.

These adjustments aim to enrich the feature set with diverse and informative interactions and transformations that could potentially enhance the predictive performance of the model regarding heart disease presence.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 20:12:34,520 - INFO - llm output = To provide a better feature set using the given operations and examples, let's consider feature transformation techniques that are commonly useful for improving model predictions, such as leveraging non-linear transformations and scaling. Combining insights from both examples given:

- Use cubes and squares to handle non-linearity.
- Employ reciprocal transformation for features with wide-ranging values.
- Leverage different scaling techniques to normalize the data.
- Utilize trigonometric transformations to capture periodic patterns.

Here is one possible improved feature set:

```

This feature set aims to combine various transformations to enhance prediction capability by addressing non-linearity, skewness, scaling, and interactions among features. The additions and multiplications are carefully selected to promote interaction between the key features. Make sure to evaluate the model performance using this new feature set to ensure improvement in prediction accuracy.

Here's the reasoning for some of the transformations and combinations used:

1. **Basic Mathematical Transformations**: Square and cube transformations will help capture non-linear relationships.
2. **Root and Logarithmic Transformations**: Allows for variance stabilization and can help in scenarios with exponential growth or skewness.
3. **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine and cosine can capture cyclic patterns or interactions that are not linear.
4. **Sigmoid and Tanh**: Useful for normalizing values between -1 and 1 or 0 and 1, which can be particularly helpful when features are on different scales.
5. **Standard and Min-Max Scaling**: Crucial for feature standardization—preparing data for algorithms sensitive to the scale of the data.
6. **Quantile Transformation**: Helps to map the data to a uniform distribution, reducing the influence of outliers.
7. **Arithmetic Operations (+, *, /)**: Captures interactions between different features, potentially unveiling underlying relationships that individual features alone may not detect.

Ensure that any missing values or categorical features are handled appropriately before applying these transformations. This new feature set seeks to balance the depth of the feature space with computational efficiency and predictive power.

- I've retained existing features that combine original features with mathematical transformations (e.g., square, reciprocal).
- I've kept and introduced new interaction terms that involve combinations of two or more features. These are represented by expressions like `f2 f8 +` and added cube transformations for new perspectives.
- I included a standardized version of `f10` with `f6` for possibly capturing importance relative to `f6`.
- Cube transformation was introduced to capture non-linear relationships possible via interactions.
- Selected interaction and transformation combinations are aimed to highlight interactions between clinical features and their potential non-linear influence on the target.

1. **f2 f3 f4 log cos * minmax_scaler**: This captures potential nonlinear interactions between f2, f3, and f4 by taking the logarithm, followed by cosine, and then scaling. This can reveal hidden patterns in distributions that might indicate heart disease.

2. **f8 f4 reciprocal cube tanh minmax_scaler**: Applies reciprocal and cubic transformation, followed by a tanh function which could capture outliers or extreme values between features f8 and f4, especially useful for nonlinear modeling.

3. **f9 f10 / sin * max**: This feature aims to capture complex interactions between f9 and f10 by performing division and applying the sine function. The `max` encapsulates the largest interaction strength, which might be critical in identifying high-risk cases of heart disease.

2026-01-19 20:13:44,484 - INFO - llm output = To derive a better feature set based on the given examples, we can focus on meaningful combinations, feature scaling, and transformations that help in uncovering non-linear relationships or account for missing data. Here’s a suggested new feature set that leverages both examples with some additional creativity:

```

```

Here are some improvements and justifications for this feature set:

- **Scaling and Transformation**: Continued use of `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, and logarithmic transformations provide normalization and handle skewness, essential for algorithms sensitive to that aspect.
  
- **Non-linear Interactions**: More interactions and squaring (i.e., `f9 f8 sqrt * f9 f8 sqrt * * square`) can capture higher-order relationships.
  
- **Handling Missing Values**: The use of combinations like `f1 f10 f7 + +` is robust to missing values by leveraging aggregate operations.

- **Complex Interactions**: Introducing complex combinations like `f3 f7 * f2 sqrt /` attempts to find non-linear and interactive effects between heart rate, chest pain type, and age-related attributes.

This new feature set aims for more advanced interactions to better capture relationships that could influence the presence of heart disease, while also maintaining or improving interpretability and computational efficiency.

2026-01-19 20:13:57,970 - INFO - llm output = Certainly! To enhance the feature set given the examples provided, we want to create meaningful transformations that capture underlying patterns and interactions between attributes. I will introduce a feature that combines various operations effectively:

```

```

Explanation:

- **(f3 sqrt f7 tanh f6 sqrt *) sqrt**: This combines the square root of `f3`, hyperbolic tangent of `f7`, and square root of `f6`, taking the element-wise product and then applying a square root. This attempts to capture complex relationships between resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, ST depression indicators.
  
- **(f6 f3 sqrt reciprocal) tanh f1 sqrt ***: Constructs a complex interaction by applying reciprocal, then hyperbolic tangent transformation, aiming to capture nonlinear relationships in `f6` and `f3` influenced by `f1` (sex).

- **((f4 log f12 sqrt *) f0 minmax_scaler + f8 stand_scaler) sqrt**: This feature combines multiple transformations to focus on interactions between cholesterol (`f4`), `f12` cube, `f0` age scaled, and `f8` exercise-induced angina; normalizing the results and finally applying square root.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Key adjustments:
1. Utilize `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize features for models sensitive to feature scale.
2. Introduce `log`, `cube`, `square`, and `reciprocal` to capture non-linear relationships.
3. Jointly combine features in more complex non-linear fashions (`f3 f4 f7 + +`, `f2 f3 f7 * +`) to highlight potential interactions.
4. Employ trigonometric functions (`cos`, `sin`) and hyperbolic functions (`tanh`) to uncover cyclical or extreme behavior patterns, which can be significant in physiological data.
