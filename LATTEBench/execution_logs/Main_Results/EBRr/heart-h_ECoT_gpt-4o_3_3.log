you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-19 19:56:11,034 - INFO - llm output = To improve the prediction of heart disease presence, I'll combine useful aspects of both feature sets provided, while introducing some new transformations that may capture additional relationships or patterns in the data. This new feature set includes a mixture of scaling, non-linear transformations, and interaction terms that might be beneficial for the predictive task. Here's a proposed feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:
- **Scaling and Standardization**: Keeps the data normalized to reduce the effect of feature scales, which is especially useful for models sensitive to scale.
- **Non-linear Transformations**: Use of tanh, cube, square, and other non-linear transformations to model possible non-linear relationships within the data.
- **Interaction Terms**: Multiplying features such as `f3 f4 *` and `f7 f4 *` allows the model to consider how these features interact, potentially capturing more complex patterns.
- **Logarithmic and Reciprocal Transformations**: These are useful for dealing with skewed data and can help stabilize variance and normalize the distribution.
- **Min-max and Quantile Transformations**: Additional scaling methods can be beneficial, especially for features with outliers or non-normal distributions.
- **Cosine Transformation**: Utilized to transform periodic or cyclic patterns that might be present in the data, particularly relevant for features like heart rate (thalach) or age.

These transformations and interactions can contribute to improving the model's ability to capture complex patterns related to heart disease prediction.

[f2 f10 tanh - f8 f2 tanh - cube - , f10 f8 f2 tanh - - cube - , f8 f10 tanh - f2 tanh f8 - * , f9 tanh f2 tanh - f10 cube - , f2 tanh f10 tanh - f9 f10 tanh - * , f10 tanh f8 - f9 cube - f2 tanh - , f8 tanh f2 - f10 f8 tanh - * , f2 tanh f8 f10 tanh - - , f9 tanh f10 tanh - f2 - , f2 tanh f10 - f8 * f2 tanh + ]
```

This feature set captures non-linear interactions between blood pressure, max heart rate, and exercise induced features in complex ways, enhancing the potential of useful patterns with respect to the presence of heart disease. The transformations used (tanh, cube) can help to reduce the impact of outliers and capture complex relationships.

Following this approach, I will propose an even better feature set by adding more feature interactions and non-linear transformations to capture complex relationships:

In this feature set, I have included a variety of operations including squares, cubes, and scalers that could reveal non-linear relationships in the data. The inclusion of feature interactions and complex transformations like `sigmoid`, `tanh` and `minmax_scaler` also allows capturing non-linear patters possibly related to heart disease.

### Explanation:
1. **Utilized Transformations:**
   - **Tanh and Square:** Used on selected features to capture non-linearity and amplify differences.
   - **Minmax and Stand Scaler:** Applied to `f4` and combinations directly impacting models sensitive to feature scales.
   - **Trigonometric Functions (sin, cos):** For potential periodic patterns, especially related to `f7`.
   - **Combinations & Cannibalizations:** Mixed various features using arithmetic operations to explore interaction effects.
   - **Cube:** Applied to potent derived features for leveraging cubic growth trends, where applicable.

2. **Newly Introduced Features:**
   - **Logical Combinations:** Some derived features involve subtractive and max-min reductions followed by scaling; these are designed for contrast capturing.
   - **`f10` and `f8` Interactions:** Their transformations have been collected and amplified by operations involving direct computations and transformation stacking.

This consolidated feature set is aimed at balancing the introduction of non-linearity, multi-dimensional interaction handling, and enhanced interpretability across various machine learning models applicable to heart disease prediction tasks.

2026-01-19 19:56:56,992 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set for predicting heart disease, it's essential to focus on capturing interactions and transformations that may reveal underlying patterns while considering computational efficiency. Using the provided examples as inspiration, let's construct a more optimized feature set. We'll consider including a mix of polynomial features, interactions between key variables, and some non-linear transformations while avoiding redundancy.

Here's the proposed feature set:

```
[f2, f8, f10, f1 f8 *, f2 f10 *, f4 f9 *, f4 sin, f0 f7 stand_scaler *, f2 f9 +, f5 f6 *, f7 stand_scaler, f4 reciprocal, f6 f10 tanh *, f9 f11 *, f8 f12 quan_trans *, f11 f12 +, f4 sigmoid, f0 sqrt, f1 cube, f3 f7 /, f5 f10 /]
```

**Explanation:**
- **Preserve Core Features:** We retain core features like f2, f8, and f10 that appear consistently and could be foundational predictors.
- **Multiplicative Interactions:** Combine different features multiplicatively to capture potential interactions, e.g., f1 f8 * and f2 f10 *.
- **Feature Transformations:** Apply transformations such as sin, reciprocal, and tanh to capture non-linear relationships, e.g., f4 sin and f4 reciprocal.
- **Feature Scaling:** Use scaling methodologies to standardize key features, e.g., f0 f7 stand_scaler *.
- **Augment Through Addition:** Introduce polynomial features via addition to capture linear interactions between important features, e.g., f2 f9 + and f5 f6 *.
- **Selective Use of Advanced Transformations:** Apply more advanced transformations to selected features only, to maintain interpretability and reduce computation cost, e.g., f8 f12 quan_trans * and f0 sqrt.

Considering the provided feature sets, we want to generate additional meaningful transformations that might be useful for the model:

1. Starting from combination and transformations present in the feature sets provided like differences and cube (which are considered complex interactions and nonlinear transformations), let's construct a new feature set:
   
```plaintext
[f0 f3 /, f4 f3 /, f4 f8 /, f4 f0 /, f11 f12 *, f2 f3 *, f3 f4 *, f10 f11 *, f11 f12 *, f3 stand_scaler sqrt, f7 stand_scaler sqrt, f0 stand_scaler square, f11 stand_scaler log, f2 f10 - cube tanh, f8 f10 - cube tanh, f11 f10 - cube tanh, f7 f3 * reciprocal, f10 f6 - tanh sin, f12 f8 - cube sin, f12 f10 - cube sin, f11 f12 * minmax_scaler]
```

In this feature set:
- Ratios (f0 f3 /, f4 f3 /, etc.) can capture relative differences which sometimes offer normalized insights into feature importance.
- Products and pairwise interactions (f11 f12 *, f10 f11 *), which introduce non-linear relationships.
- Standard scaling followed by square (f0) or square root (f3, f7) helps maintain the scale of original features while capturing distribution properties.
- Operations like tanh and sin on cubed differences capture further non-linear and oscillatory relationships that might mimic some physiological processes.
- Using reciprocal provides a non-linear transformation often useful if there's an asymptotic relationship.
- Applying min-max scaling after operations helps contain values in a confined range, reducing model sensitivity to feature scale.

These transformations bring out non-obvious relations and interactions within the dataset that may enhance model predictions based on heart disease indicators.

```

1. Operations like `square`, `tanh`, `quan_trans`, and `stand_scaler` help in linearizing non-linear relationships and normalizing feature distributions, which can enhance model performance. 

2. Multiplication of features like `f3 f4 *` and `f7 f4 *` captures interactions between features that might represent multiplicative effects on the target variable.

3. The inclusion of `f2 f6 *` and `f6 f4 f4 * sqrt /` captures potential non-linear interaction effects while maintaining variable interpretation.

4. Utilizing operations like `reciprocal` and `sqrt` on features capture inverse relationships and diminish the impact of large values that could disproportionately skew predictions.

5. Pairwise combinations and operations like `f3 f10 * stand_scaler` help align different scales among numerical features for more balanced model inputs. 

This constructed feature set aims to introduce additional complexity where beneficial and reduce noise where applicable, thereby assisting a model to better predict heart disease presence.

2026-01-19 19:57:41,212 - INFO - llm output = To generate a new feature set by combining the better aspects of both given sets, we want to leverage a combination of complex operations and simpler, interpretable transformations. The first set includes complex feature transformations through intricate operations like multiplication chains and minmax_scaler, while the second set involves simpler binary subtractions and some non-linear transformations like cubes and trigonometric operations. 

A balanced approach will incorporate essential transformations from both sets. Here's a possible new feature set:

1. \( f9 \, f4 \, * \, f4 \, f9 \, * \, f4 \, * \, f4 \, f6 \, * \, * \, * \, \text{minmax_scaler} \) - Retaining a complex transformation scaled to a min-max range.
   
2. \( f2 \, f4 \, * \, f4 \, f4 \, * \, * \, \text{tanh} \) - From the first set, captures non-linear interaction followed by a hyperbolic tangent.

3. \( f10 \, f2 \, - \, \text{cube} \) - A simple subtraction followed by a cubic transformation from the second set.

4. \( f10 \, f6 \, - \, \text{cos} \) - Combining a difference with a cosine transformation offering non-linearity.

5. \( f4 \, f5 \, * \, f4 \, * \, f2 \, f4 \, * \, * \, \text{tanh} \, - \) - This reflects a complex sequence, concluding with a subtraction and tanh for additional non-linearity.

By integrating a mix of complex combinations and emotion transformations, this feature set should provide a robust foundation for predicting the presence of heart disease in the patient, catering to various underlying patterns and interactions within the data.

2026-01-19 19:57:47,348 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set for improving the prediction of heart disease, I will take inspiration from the transformation techniques used in the two input examples. Both examples mainly focus on using standard scaling and transformations like cube and reciprocal. Here's a crafted feature set that incorporates both of these ideas while also introducing new transformations for potentially better predictive features:

```plaintext
[f0 stand_scaler, f1 stand_scaler, f2 stand_scaler, f3 stand_scaler, f4 sin, f5 stand_scaler, f6 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f8 stand_scaler, f9 stand_scaler, f10 stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler, f12 stand_scaler, f2 f8 f10 - stand_scaler, f9 f3 / stand_scaler, f2 f8 * stand_scaler, f10 f9 + stand_scaler, f8 f4 cube, f10 f3 cube reciprocal, f3 f8 f10 - + sin, f10 f11 f2 - * cube]
```

This feature set includes:

- **Standard scaling** for all main features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, which helps in models sensitive to feature scales.
- **Sine transformation** on `f4` to capture periodic trends, which can be useful if there are physiological cycles involved.
- **Cubic transformation** and **reciprocal** on combinations of existing features (`f8`, `f4`, `f10`, `f3`) to account for potential non-linear relationships.
- Combination of features through operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` to explore interactions between them.
- Complex transformations which combine multiple operations on features to potentially capture intricate patterns that simple transformations might miss. 

This feature engineering aims to extract maximum information by transforming and combining existing attributes to better understand underlying relationships and improve the predictive power of the model.

```

### Explanation:
1. **Preserved original features**: It maintains access to raw features in case they contain information useful on their own.
2. **Transformed features**:
   - Various transformations (e.g., `square`, `tanh`, `quantile transformation`) are retained for their potential to enhance model performance due to non-linearity and normalization.
3. **Newly added interactions**:
   - I've added interactions like `f3 f4 f7 cube * * log` by combining multiple features, allowing the model to capture complex relationships that might not be evident in linear combinations alone.
4. **Feature-Reduction**: Avoids completely redundant features (e.g., features that are simple aliases of others) and focuses on combinations that introduce nonlinearity and interactions to capture underlying patterns in the data.

The chosen transformations should help in the modeling process by potentially highlighting complex relationships in the data which are crucial for predicting heart disease.

### Explanation:
- **Use of Min-Max Scaler and Standard Scaler**: These are useful preprocessing steps to ensure that the features are on a similar scale, which can improve the performance of many machine-learning algorithms.
- **Cube and Sigmoid Transformations**: Cubing a feature can amplify differences, which might be useful for distinguishing extreme values. The sigmoid function is used for normalization to squeeze input values to a range between 0 and 1.
- **Feature Combinations**: By combining features using basic arithmetic operations and then applying transformations, you derive new patterns that may capture more complex relationships not readily apparent in individual features.
- **Reciprocal Transformation**: This is particularly useful for handling skewed distributions and magnifying small differences in larger values.

The goal of these transformations and combinations is to capture and highlight the relationships in the data more effectively, potentially allowing the predictive model to improve accuracy and generalize better.

- Retained the core features: f0 to f12.
- Incorporated various transformations (e.g., tanh, cube, square, quan_trans) on relevant features like f3 (resting blood pressure) and f7 (maximum heart rate) due to their continuous nature.
- Added interactions and feature combinations such as `f0 f9 /` (age divided over oldpeak) and `f0 f8 square * f7 - sigmoid` which have potential nonlinear relationships impacting the target outcome.
- Used common scaling techniques like minmax and reciprocal for certain features to normalize them, aiding in making the model less sensitive to extreme values.
- Focused on features that are derived from interactions and non-linear transformations, aimed at capturing complex patterns beneficial for the prediction of heart disease presence.

2026-01-19 19:59:10,410 - INFO - llm output = Based on the two feature sets provided, let's create an improved feature set in postfix notation. The goal is to derive features that may better capture relevant patterns for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients.

Considering the features and transformations used in both examples, along with their complexity and mathematical operations, let's design a feature that seeks to combine these ideas into a potentially more informative feature set.

Here's the improved feature set:

```plaintext
[f10 f8 - f2 f11 - * cube f4 f6 * f4 * f2 f4 * * minmax_scaler sqrt ,f9 f4 * f4 f9 * f4 * * f4 f9 * f4 * f6 f4 * * * minmax_scaler f4 f5 * f4 * f2 f4 * * - f4 f9 * f4 * f4 f6 * * minmax_scaler f4 f9 * f4 * f6 f4 * * f4 f9 * f4 * f4 f6 * * * minmax_scaler - - cube cos ,f10 f8 - f2 f9 - * cube minmax_scaler f4 f5 * f4 * f2 f4 * * - tanh ,f11 f2 - f10 f6 - * cube cos tanh ,f10 f6 - f9 f4 * f4 f9 * f4 * * f4 f9 * f4 * f6 f4 * * * minmax_scaler sqrt ]
```

**Explanation:**

1. The first expression (`f10 f8 - f2 f11 - * cube f4 f6 * f4 * f2 f4 * * minmax_scaler sqrt`) creates a feature based on differences involving `f10` and `f8`, and `f2` and `f11`, combined with additional multiplicative operations on other features, capped with transformations like `cube`, `minmax_scaler`, and `sqrt`. This aims to capture interactions and scale them effectively.

2. The second expression is a mix of complex operations combining expressions from both initial feature sets to increase feature variety. The use of `minmax_scaler`, `cube`, and `cos` transformations translates interactions into standardized formats that might uncover unique patterns or relationships.

3. The third expression uses difference and product combinations of critical features followed by transformation, leveraging `cube` and `tanh`, to handle potential non-linear patterns and normalize the feature.

4. The fourth expression combines linear and transformation operations to explore a potentially informative interaction effect between features.

5. The last expression uses synthesis of conditional and interaction terms from examples and combines them further using typical scaling and normalization operations, adapting complex patterns into simpler forms while retaining their information content.

This sequence is designed in hopes of generating diverse, comprehensive feature representations that can enrich the prediction quality of the model for heart disease detection.

This feature set includes additional non-linear transformations like `tanh`, `sinh`, `cos`, and `log`, applied to various feature interactions. These transformations can help capture complex, non-linear relationships within the data while maintaining diversity across generated features. Additionally, scaling methods like `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` are used to ensure that the feature values are on a comparable scale, which can be important for some machine learning models.

- **Features Included**: Retaining meaningful interactions involving `f2`, `f8`, `f9`, and `f10` which are present in the examples, along with introducing `tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, and `cube` operations.
- **Operational Diversity**: Balanced use of operations to capture non-linear transformations (`tanh`, `cube`) and normalization (`minmax_scaler`).
- **Theory**: Utilize non-linear activation functions like `tanh` to help model potential non-linear relationships and enhance model prediction quality.

This feature expression aims to capture potential non-linearities while still using normalization and non-linear transformations like cube to add depth to feature representation, all based on the styles and transformations emphasized in the given examples.

Here's a proposed feature set in postfix notation:

```

```

Explanation:

1. **Interactions and transformations**: Combines and transforms features that could have non-linear relationships (e.g., `f0 f3 *`, `f1 f7 *`, `f1 f7 cube *`).
2. **Activation-like transformations**: Uses functions like `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and `cos` to simulate activation functions that can capture non-linear behaviors.
3. **Feature scaling**: Applies `minmax_scaler` and other scaling transformations to help with model convergence and to normalize the feature values.
4. **Complex feature interactions**: Includes complex interactions that bring in multiple features and non-linear transformations (e.g., `f0 f3 tanh * f9 /`, `f3 f9 tanh * sigmoid`).
5. **Statistical transformations**: Uses transformations like `log` and `reciprocal`, which are useful for normalizing skewed distributions.
6. **Noise reduction**: By transforming and combining features, noise and variability can be reduced, making patterns more apparent.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

- Standard scaling is applied to features to normalize numerical attributes, which can improve model convergence and performance.
- A combination of previously suggested differences and nonlinear transformations (tanh, cube) is retained to capture potential interactions between features.
- The additional sinus transformation is kept for feature diversification.

This proposed set includes the following considerations:

1. **Basic features**: Retaining the original features to maintain foundational data.
2. **Square, Tanh, and Cube functions** cleverly applied to non-linearize relationships in features like resting heart rate (`f7`) and others.
3. **Combination of features**: Products of certain features (`f3 f4 *`, `f0 f4 *`) should capture interactions between them.
4. **Transformations**: Additional transformations like `sqrt`, `reciprocal`, `log`, and `minmax_scaler` help in normalizing and stabilizing variance in features.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction/Simplification**: Using `minmax_scaler` and `quan_trans` to normalize and adapt feature distributions for better model processing.
6. **Interaction Terms**: Form deep interactions such as `f0 f8 * sqrt` for capturing meaningful, complex relationships.

These engineered features can then be fed into a sophisticated prediction model to enhance its ability to predict the presence of heart disease more effectively.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-19 20:01:15,805 - INFO - llm output = To construct a new and potentially better feature set, I'll consider combining different feature transformations and interactions from the given sets. Keeping in mind the importance of capturing non-linear relationships and distribution smoothing for predictive modeling, here's an example that aims for a balanced mix of transformations and interactions:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f4 square, f3 tanh, f7 tanh, f3 f7 *, f0 f4 *, f3 f4 *, f4 f7 /, f3 cube, f0 square, f7 cube, f3 quan_trans, f7 quan_trans, f11 minmax_scaler, f8 minmax_scaler, f0 sqrt, f5 log, f6 reciprocal, f2 cos, f1 sigmoid, f0 f3 * f7 cube + minmax_scaler, f2 f1 + square, f0 f8 f4 * sqrt, f3 f4 * square, f4 f3 * f7 + tanh]
```

### Explanation:

- **Basic Features**: Retain the base features (f0 through f12) to keep the original information intact.
- **Transformations**: Square, cube, reciprocal, tanh, and log transformations help capture non-linearities and distribution smoothing.
- **Feature Interactions**: Including interactions like f3 f7 *, f0 f4 *, and others to capture complex relationships between features.
- **Scaling**: Min-max scaling and quantile transformation can enhance the model's ability to generalize by bringing features to a similar scale.
- **Complex Combinations**: Use of combined transformations and interactions like f0 f3 * f7 cube + minmax_scaler and f4 f3 * f7 + tanh capture deeper relationships within the data.
