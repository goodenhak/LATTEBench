In this feature set, I've:
1. Applied the `sqrt` transformation to a comprehensive set of features to capture potential roots.
2. Added the `log` transformation to certain numerical features to manage skewness and capture exponential relationships.
3. Introduced the `tanh` transformation to capture any saturation effects or boundaries.
4. Combined pairs of features using multiplication to capture interaction effects. 

These transformations enhance the expressiveness of the feature set for better predictive performance in the context of the given task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:22:19,652 - INFO - llm output = Based on the provided examples of feature sets, the primary objective appears to be generating new features that enhance predictive capacity while maintaining variety in transformations applied to the original features. The latter feature set shows simplicity and the application of basic transformation functions like `sqrt` more broadly across features, which might normalize data and reveal underlying relationships efficiently. Let's create a new feature set that combines some concepts from both previous examples, ensuring a well-rounded transformation approach:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f0 stand_scaler, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 log, f5 sqrt, f6 stand_scaler, f7 sqrt, f8 stand_scaler, f9 sqrt, f10 stand_scaler, f11 sqrt, f12 stand_scaler, f13 sqrt, f14 log, f15 sqrt, f16 sqrt, f17 sqrt, f18 stand_scaler, f19 sqrt, f0 sin, f2 sin, f4 log sqrt sin, f11 sin]
```

This new set uses a combination of standard scaling and square root transformations to standardize data distribution, along with occasional usage of log and sinusoidal transformations to capture non-linear patterns or periodicity where applicable. The goal is to create diverse features while maintaining simplicity and improving prediction.

The aim is to create a robust feature set by combining elements of both examples while exploring new combinations of transformations that may uncover new patterns without overfitting.

Here's a newly designed feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f4, f6, f7, f9, f11, f13, f15, f18, f19, 
 f0 sqrt, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f13 sqrt, f14 sqrt, f16 sqrt, f17 sqrt, f19 sqrt,

```

### Justifications:

1. **Broad Coverage:** This feature set covers a wide range of initial features, ensuring that important aspects of the data aren't missed.

2. **Diverse Transformations:** Includes common transformations (e.g., square root) across several features, along with more specialized ones (e.g., log and quantile transformation) to handle potential skewness and non-linear relationships.

3. **Exploration of Non-linear Relationships:** By experimenting with multiple square root applications and logarithmic transformations, we can capture non-linear influences more effectively.

4. **Incorporation of Normalization Techniques:** Using quantile and min-max transformations could help in reducing the effect of scale differences between features, making them more comparable.

This combination aims to create a balanced set of features that includes direct, transformed, and normalized representations, making the model flexible and robust without overly depending on any particular transformation or original feature.

The idea is to introduce a diverse range of transformations and ensure a comprehensive representation of the original features through derived features. Here is a proposed feature set:

```

```

### Explanation:
- **Basic Transformations:** We retained and built upon existing transformations such as `sqrt`, `log`, and `square`. These provide useful non-linear perspectives of the original data.
- **Statistical Normalization:** Introduced `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize the data, helping facilitate learning algorithms that may assume normalized data distribution.
- **Activation Functions:** Introduced `tanh` and `sigmoid`, which are commonly used in neural networks to squish values to a more bounded metric.
- **Advanced Non-Linear Transformations:** Added `reciprocal` and `cube` options to introduce more non-linear diversity and capture potential multiplicative relationships.
- **Increased Dimensionality:** By adding extra variations of feature transformations, it can capture complex interactions and relationships not observed in raw features.

By building a more varied, though complex, feature set, we can potentially improve the predictive performance when such features are included in a machine learning model, by capturing more patterns present in the data.

2026-01-17 17:22:54,468 - INFO - llm output = When considering features for generating a new feature set, it's essential to incorporate operations that capture useful information possibly related to the target task, which in this case is predicting credit approval.

From the two given feature sets, the main operations utilized such as `sqrt`, `sigmoid`, and various scalers (`stand_scaler`, `quan_trans`) can be applied to both raw features and transformations of those features to extract intricate patterns.

Here's a more refined feature set:
```plaintext
[f0 , f4 , f0 sqrt , f4 reciprocal , f0 sigmoid , f4 sqrt , f0 log , f4 reciprocal log , f2 log , f4 sqrt log , f0 sqrt sigmoid , f4 sqrt sigmoid , f0 log sigmoid , f2 log sigmoid , f4 reciprocal log sigmoid , f4 sqrt sqrt , f0 quan_trans , f11 quan_trans , f0 sqrt quan_trans , f0 log quan_trans , f0 sqrt log quan_trans , f0 sqrt log quan_trans sqrt , f2 log quan_trans sqrt , f4 reciprocal log sigmoid sqrt , f0 log quan_trans sqrt , f0 sqrt quan_trans sqrt , f2 log quan_trans sqrt , f2 log sigmoid sqrt , f4 reciprocal log sigmoid sqrt , f4 reciprocal log sqrt , f0 quan_trans sqrt , f0 sqrt log , f4 sqrt sqrt sqrt , f0 sqrt log quan_trans sqrt sqrt , f2 log sigmoid quan_trans sqrt sqrt , f4 reciprocal log quan_trans sqrt sqrt , f4 reciprocal log sigmoid sqrt sqrt , f0 sqrt quan_trans sqrt sqrt , f0 sqrt log sqrt sqrt , f2 log quan_trans sqrt sqrt , f4 reciprocal log sqrt sqrt , f4 reciprocal sqrt sqrt sqrt , f0 quan_trans sqrt sqrt , f0 log sqrt sqrt , f11 quan_trans sqrt sqrt]
```

In this feature set:
- Added `log` transformations, as they can help handle skewed data and reveal multiplicative relationships.
- Continued the use of `reciprocal`, `sqrt`, and `sigmoid` to retain useful non-linear transformations.
- Used combinations of these operations along with `quan_trans` for capturing complex, interactions which may improve prediction accuracy.

2026-01-17 17:23:01,755 - INFO - llm output = To generate a better feature set based on the provided examples, we can combine some ideas from both and introduce increasingly complex feature transformations. Here is a possible improved feature set that builds on patterns from both examples:

```

```

### Explanation of the Improvements:

1. **Transformation Diversity**: Merging choices of transformations from both sets increases the diversity of nonlinear transformations (`sigmoid`, `tanh`, `quan_trans`, `sqrt`) to account for complex relationships.
  
2. **Reduction of Depth**: Simplification by reducing the depth of transformations yet maintaining a rich variety improves interpretability without sacrificing expressive capacity.

3. **Use of Learned Transformations**: Including operations like `quan_trans` and `sigmoid` ensures transformations that can capture thresholds and saturation points helpful in classification tasks.

4. **Minimal Redundancy**: Streamlining similar transformations (e.g., multiple `sqrt`) helps to reduce potentially redundant computations, focusing instead on the intrinsic value from combined unique transformations.

5. **Emphasizing Potentially Important Features**: By including features frequently transformed in both examples, like `f0`, `f2`, and `f19`, we leverage potentially significant predictive attributes.

Explanation:
- Retained core features such as `f0`, `f1`, `f3`, `f4`, `f16` to ensure key dimensions are covered.
- Included a mix of square root transformations and their nested variations for features to explore their non-linear relationships better.
- Added reciprocal transformations for `f4` to capture inverse relationships, acknowledging its frequent use in both original sets.
- Introduced a `sigmoid` transformation to map features to a bounded range, potentially handling any outliers or scaling issues.
- Added a basic mathematical operation, such as square and log transformations, to enrich the feature space with additional non-linear and non-zero-sensitive representations.
- Kept one subtraction operation with `f4` based on the previous context, aiming to preserve any important differences between features as previously considered.

This new set leverages feature scaling, transformation, and some feature interactions from both previous sets. Key considerations include:

1. **Standard Scaling (stand_scaler)** and **Square Root Transformation (sqrt)** for continuous features to help reduce skewness and align features with normality.

2. **Log Transformation (log)** on positively skewed data like `f4` to stabilize variance.

3. **Trigonometric Transformations (sin, tanh)** are applied to some features for adding non-linear relationships.

4. **Feature Interactions**: Combined transformations like `f4 log f8 tanh *` and `f9 stand_scaler f4 *` to capture interactions between features, which might be valuable for certain models.

This feature set is crafted to enhance the ability of models such as linear classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks to capture relationships within the data.

Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

2026-01-17 17:23:36,538 - INFO - llm output = To provide a new, improved feature set by combining elements from both given sets, we should retain the features with potential predictive value while incorporating useful transformations. Here is a suggested improved feature set:

```

### Rationale

1. **Inclusion of All Original Features**: Both feature sets include all original features (f0 to f19), indicating their baseline importance.
  
2. **Standard Scaling**: Using standard scaling on features like `f2`, `f5`, `f7`, `f14`, and `f18` from the first set can help normalize their values and reduce the effect of magnitude differences.

3. **Sqrt Transformation**: Applying the square root transformation on `f1` helps in stabilizing variance and transforming skewed distributions, which is a simple yet effective transformation.

4. **MinMax Scaling**: Including min-max scaling from the first set for `f3` ensures that the range of this feature is between 0 and 1, which can be especially useful if this feature interacts with methods sensitive to absolute values (like neural networks).

By including these transformations, while keeping the full set of original features, the new feature set is likely to capture a broader range of variability and potentially improve model performance.

[f0, f2, f4, f12, f18, f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f0 sqrt sqrt, f2 sqrt sqrt, f14 sqrt sqrt, f15 sqrt sqrt, f6 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f9 sqrt sqrt, f11 sqrt sqrt, f12 sqrt, f3 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f9 sqrt, f2 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f6 sqrt sqrt sqrt, f12 cube, f12 cube sqrt, f18 sqrt sqrt, f12 sqrt log sqrt]
```

### Explanation:
- **Base Features**: A subset of original features to retain maximum signal, focusing on those present in both examples: `f0`, `f2`, `f4`.
- **Higher Order Features**:
  - **Root Transformations**: Inclusion of single, double, and triple root transformations where prevalent (focus on `sqrt`, `sqrt sqrt`, `sqrt sqrt sqrt` where doubled frequency appears).
  - **Log Transformations**: Feature transformation using `log`.
  - **Complex Transformations**: No higher power or overly complex square root formulations beyond cube transformations and roots.
- **Selections Based on Original Examples**: Including terms like `cube` and `log` for additional representation of features with higher order relationships.
- **Redundancy Reduction**: Remove overly repeated or depth-specific transformations unless adding clear value (seen by `f12` features). 

The goal is to maximize informational diversity while minimizing complexity.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

In this feature set:
- I've included a division of `f0` and `f4` (`f0 f4 /`), which might capture some interesting interaction between those two features.
- Applied `stand_scaler` to `f1` for standardization, which can help stabilize the learning process.
- Applied `minmax_scaler` to `f5` for normalization, which can put the data in a common scale.
- Applied `sigmoid` followed by `sqrt` to `f6`, which could help compress and non-linearly transform the feature.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Basic Features**: Kept the original features for baseline linear relationships.
2. **Standard Scaling & Min-Max Scaling**: Applied to select features to normalize data and improve convergence for certain models.
3. **Square-Root and Cube Transformations**: Applied to specific features to help normalize distributions that could be skewed.
4. **Logarithm Transformations**: Useful for dealing with right-skewed distributions.
5. **Trigonometric Functions**: Included both sine and tangent hyperbolic for capturing periodic or symmetric relationships.
6. **Reciprocal and Cube**: Used to alter scales and invert relationships for particular features.
7. **Quantile Transformation**: Helps in normalizing data using a different method than standard scaling.
8. **Sigmoid Function**: Can help in situations where probability-like predictions are useful. 

By using a mix of different transformations, the goal is to uncover both linear and non-linear patterns that may not be immediately visible in the original dataset. The transformations are aimed at improving the predictive power of models that will utilize these engineered features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-17 17:24:29,116 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the two provided examples, I'll focus on selecting meaningful transformations and combinations that capture variability and potentially important interactions in the data while reducing redundancy. Here’s a new feature set that attempts to leverage diverse transformations:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f12, f17, f19, f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f8 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f12 cube, f0 sqrt sqrt, f1 sqrt sqrt, f3 sqrt sqrt, f6 sqrt sqrt, f8 sqrt sqrt, f14 sqrt sqrt, f15 sqrt sqrt, f18 sqrt sqrt, f12 sqrt log sqrt, f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt]
```

Here's the reasoning behind this selection:
- **Variety of Original Features**: I selected a diverse range of original features (`f0, f1, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f12, f17, f19`) to cover different aspects of the data.
- **Square Root Transformations**: Applied to features that could be affected by non-linearity or variance, (`f0, f2, f5, f7, f8, f9`), to handle potential skewness or variance stabilization.
- **Cube Transformation**: Applied to `f12` as it was done in both feature sets, indicating potential non-linear relationships in this feature.
- **Repeated Square Root**: Double and triple square root transformations on key features (`f0, f1, f3, f6, f8`) to emphasize potential subtle variations captured in higher-order transformations.
- **Logarithmic Transformation**: Retained `f12 sqrt log sqrt` as a potential transformation to capture multiplicative depth.
- **Additional Triple Root Feature**: Included `f5 sqrt sqrt sqrt`, inspired by multiple root transformations in provided examples.

This feature set tries to balance complexity and feature diversity while retaining effective transformations illustrated in both examples.

2026-01-17 17:24:35,294 - INFO - llm output = Sure! Based on the two given feature sets, I'll aim to maintain useful transformations, reduce redundancy, and potentially add more informative transformations. Here's an improved feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f3, f4, f16, f2 sqrt, f7 sqrt, f10 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f0 log, f1 log, f4 log, f6 stand_scaler, f17 stand_scaler, f3 minmax_scaler, f12 minmax_scaler, f10 tanh, f10 sigmoid, f2 square, f5 square, f6 square, f8 square, f9 square, f18 square, f0 reciprocal, f2 reciprocal, f3 reciprocal, f7 reciprocal, f8 reciprocal, f9 reciprocal, f10 reciprocal, f18 reciprocal, f0 cube, f3 cube, f5 cube, f7 cube, f8 cube, f17 cube, f6 tanh, f14 square, f16 minmax_scaler]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Removal of Duplicates**: Removed duplicated transformations such as `f0 square`, `f0 reciprocal`, `f2 cube`, and `f6 square` since they were repeated unnecessarily in the second feature set.
2. **Maintain Useful Transformations**: Preserved transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, `cube`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh`, which can help normalize and scale feature values, improving model performance.
3. **Introduce New Transformations**: Added `f6 tanh` (tanh of feature 6), `f14 square` (square of feature 14), and `f16 minmax_scaler` (min-max scaling of feature 16) to explore potentially useful transformations that were not considered before.
4. **Balancing Complexity with Variance**: Keep a balance between complex transformations and simple ones to capture non-linear relationships while maintaining interpretability and manageability.

This set tries to be comprehensive without adding too much redundancy, focusing on transformations that standardize and scale the data effectively.

2026-01-17 17:24:51,832 - INFO - llm output = To improve the feature set based on the given examples, the objective is to derive a set of features that offer high utility for predictive modeling. The examples illustrate the usage of various transformations and combinations that enhance the feature set's capability to capture underlying patterns. The new feature set should consider the transformations and combinations already provided and aim for improvements through further combinations and transformations.

Let's construct a better feature set:

``` 
[f0, f2, f4, 
 f0 stand_scaler, f7 stand_scaler, f11 stand_scaler, f13 stand_scaler, f18 stand_scaler, f19 stand_scaler, 
 f0 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f5 sqrt, f6 sqrt, f9 sqrt, f11 sqrt, f14 sqrt,

 f14 stand_scaler stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler * /, 
 f14 stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler * reciprocal, 
 f14 stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler * sqrt, 
 f14 stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler f4 * reciprocal sqrt, 
 f9 stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler * reciprocal sin, 
 f0 stand_scaler sqrt, f0 reciprocal, f5 sqrt f4 * stand_scaler]
```

**Explanation:**
1. Utilize `stand_scaler`, `sqrt`, `log`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, and combination transformations to derive features that can potentially capture nonlinear relationships.
2. Feature combinations like `f14 stand_scaler f9 stand_scaler f4 * reciprocal sqrt` involve complex interactions that can unveil patterns not evident in individual features.
3. Additional features such as `f0 reciprocal` and `f5 sqrt f4 * stand_scaler` are included for improving understanding across different scales and relationships.

This feature set builds on the transformations presented in the examples while introducing new combinations aimed to potentially enhance predictive power in models.

This refined feature set captures more non-linear transformations such as cube and square roots, possibly helping the downstream task by introducing non-linearity and variation in the feature space.

We'll focus on deriving new features using combinations of statistical transformations, arithmetic operations, and interactions between features.

Here's a new feature set:

```plaintext
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,

```

Explanation:
- **Logarithmic and Square Root Transformations**: Useful for stabilizing variance and normalizing distributions, especially for features like `duration`, `credit_amount`, and `age`.
- **Tanh**: Non-linear transformation to capture differences in distribution.
- **Product and Division Interactions**: Helps generate new feature space that may capture interactions between variables, e.g., `duration` with `credit_amount`.
- **Reciprocal and Cube**: Further non-linear transformations to introduce more complexity and capture non-linear relationships.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Useful for features intended to be used in models sensitive to absolute magnitudes, such as gradient descent.

This set should provide a richer perspective and improve model performance by offering diverse transformations and interactions.

**Explanation:**

1. **Inclusion of Original Features**: Retaining all the original features ensures no initial information is lost.

2. **Logarithmic Transformation**: Applied to features such as f0, f1, and f4 which may benefit from normalization or reduction in variance (e.g., skewed data).

3. **Reciprocal and Square Transformations**: These provide non-linear feature mappings that can help in capturing complex relationships.

4. **Standard Scaling and MinMax Scaling**: Used to bring features to a similar scale, which is especially beneficial for models sensitive to feature variance.

5. **Non-linear Transformations**: Functions like `tanh` and `sigmoid` help in compacting feature distributions and inducing non-linear patterns within the data.

6. **Cube Transformation**: Highlighting extreme values might uncover patterns not seen with lower-order polynomials.

By using a diverse set of transformations, we aim to strike a balance between complexity and representation, enabling the model to better discern patterns and improve predictions.

We will aim to combine the strengths of the two given sets and introduce some additional transformations:

```

f18 log, f19 reciprocal, f15 sqrt f5 cube *]
```

### Justification:
1. **Retaining Common Transformations**: Both sets share several useful transformations like `stand_scaler`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `sin` which help in normalization, variance reduction and capturing non-linear relationships.
   
2. **Combining Unique Transformations**: From the first set, the inclusion of transformations like `f3 cube sqrt` and `f5 cube` can provide deeper polynomial insights into relationships. `f7 quan_trans` can help account for non-normal distributions.

3. **Multiplicative Interaction Terms**: The second set introduces multiplicative interaction terms such as `f4 log f8 tanh *`. Adding similar new interactions, like `f15 sqrt f5 cube *`, helps model complex interdependencies between features.

4. **Log and Tanh Interactions**: Using `f14 stand_scaler tanh` can be beneficial for capturing effects where feature scaling and non-linear tanh transformation align.

By integrating elements from both provided sets while maintaining format, the feature set aims to improve downstream modeling by combining normalizations, non-linear transformations, and interactions among features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

Changes and Additions Explanation:
- **f0 f0 square**: Squaring a numerical feature to enhance non-linear relations.
- **f1 minmax_scaler**: Scaling helps normalize data, making it robust for various algorithms.
- **f2 stand_scaler**: Standard scaling to bring different units to a common scale.
- **f4 f5 +**: Interaction term through addition helping capture linear relationships.
- **f7 f8 -**: Interaction term for capturing the difference, potentially reflecting risk versus return.

These transformations and interactions aim to enhance the existing features while avoiding excessive complexity that might lead to overfitting.

### Explanation:

- **Square Root, Logarithm, and Tanh Transformations:** Retained features from both examples where square root, logarithm, and tanh transformations are applied, as these can help in normalizing skewness and reducing variance in feature distributions.

- **Reciprocal Transformations:** Introduced additional reciprocal transformations for some features; this can help in handling smaller values or inverse relationships.

- **Feature Interactions (Products):** Maintained and added several interactions because products of features can capture multiplicative relationships, which might not be captured with linear models.

- **Feature Differences (Subtraction):** Retained and added several differences; these can reveal contrasts between feature pairs that might be informative.

Note that feature transformations and interactions should be validated through testing on your specific dataset to ascertain their effectiveness in improving the prediction task. Consider cross-validation to ensure robustness.

We will incorporate useful transformations like scaling, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more to potentially capture non-linearities or important interactions in the data.

Here is a new feature set based on combining and enhancing the given examples:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,

 f9 minmax_scaler, f10 tanh, f8 log sin, f13 reciprocal sqrt, f11 cube sqrt, f18 log, 
 f19 reciprocal sqrt, f14 cube sqrt]
```

In this new feature set:

- The transformations aim to capture a range of effects like scaling (`stand_scaler`, `minmax_scaler`), and non-linear transformations (`log`, `sqrt`, `cube`, `sin`, `tanh`).
- Some combinations and products (like `f4 log f8 tanh *`) aim to capture interactions between features.
- We added `reciprocal` transformations to invert values that have a strong non-linear effect.
- `quan_trans` and `stand_scaler` were retained from the examples to handle different distribution shapes and scales.

This enhanced feature set takes inspiration from the given examples, leveraging a wide range of transformations to provide potentially more predictive insights for the model.

#### Explanation:

1. **Standardization and Scaling**: Used stand_scaler and minmax_scaler on relevant features to normalize and scale data.
   
2. **Mathematical Transformations**: Applied square root, logarithm, sinusoidal transformations (sin), and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) to capture nonlinearities. 

3. **Combinations**: Created combinations using arithmetic operations and transformations to synergize different feature interactions, e.g., `f4 log f8 tanh *`.

4. **New Transformations**: Introduced cube and reciprocal, which were not previously used, to enrich data variation and possibly uncover critical patterns.

5. **Balanced Complexity**: Aim to keep the feature set diverse yet concise enough to prevent overfitting and improve interpretability.

By leveraging advanced transformations and thoughtful combinations, we enhance the feature space with potential to boost predictive accuracy on the creditworthiness task.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

This feature set retains a good mix of original features and various transformations seen previously, with a focus on sqrt transformations for smooth scaling and cube/quadratic transformations for capturing non-linear relationships. Additionally, I included the quantile transformation of `f2`, which is useful for normalizing skewed data. The inclusion of both sqrt and cube transformations aims to capture various aspect scales.

```

### Explanation:

1. **Standard Scaling (`stand_scaler`)**: Retaining `f6 stand_scaler` and `f0 stand_scaler` from the latter example to normalize these features for potentially enhancing predictive power.

2. **Min-Max Scaling (`minmax_scaler`)**: Used for both `f3` and `f12` to scale these features to a [0, 1] range, improving uniformity and consistency in range.

3. **Log Transformation (`log`)**: Maintaining both `f5 log` and `f8 log` from the latter example to handle skewness and reduce the impact of outliers.

4. **Reciprocal Transformation (`reciprocal`)**: Apply to `f4` from the former example for handling skewness and large range values.

5. **Square Root Transformation (`sqrt`)**: New transformation applied to `f0` to reduce skewness and lessen the impact of outliers without as drastic an effect as log transformation.

6. **Arithmetic Combinations**:
   - **`f6 f4 /`**: Division of standardized feature `f6` by `f4 reciprocal`, emphasizing relationships by combining transformed features.
   - **`f5 f1 -`**: Subtraction between `f5 log` and `f1`, potentially capturing latent differences in scaled space.

These transformations are chosen to capture diverse aspects of the data, addressing skewness, range differences, and potential interactions between features.

### Explanation:
- **Balanced Extensions**: Include basic statistical transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, and `cube` with selective scaling using `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler`.
- **Diverse Non-linear Transformations**: More non-linear transformations such as `tanh`, `square`, `reciprocal`, and `sigmoid` are used selectively, especially on features that are inherently non-linear or potentially impactful like `credit_amount` or `duration`.
- **Feature Interactions**: Opt for interactive features like `f0 f1 *` to better capture dependencies or indirect influences between them. This could uncover relationships that simple transformations might miss.
- **Division and Trigonometric Elements**: Adding division (e.g., `f4 f19 /`) and trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`) provides potential for capturing periodic behavior or saturation effects. Adjusting these functionalities takes into account features with potential cyclical effects.
  
This new feature set is structured to enhance flexibility and insight through comprehensive transformations. It offers a balance between complexity and computational feasibility for predictive modeling tasks.

[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19, f0 stand_scaler, f1 sqrt, f2 sqrt, f3 sqrt, f4 log, f5 sqrt, f6 stand_scaler, f7 sqrt, f8 stand_scaler, f9 sqrt, f10 stand_scaler, f11 sqrt, f12 stand_scaler, f13 sqrt, f14 log, f15 sqrt, f16 sqrt, f17 sqrt, f18 stand_scaler, f19 sqrt, f0 sin, f2 sin, f4 log sqrt sin, f11 sin, f4 log f8 tanh *, f9 stand_scaler f4 *, f14 stand_scaler tanh, f3 cube sqrt, f5 cube, f2 reciprocal, f9 minmax_scaler, f14 log sqrt, f1 sqrt sqrt, f3 tanh, f10 tanh, f6 sigmoid, f7 quan_trans, f18 log, f19 reciprocal, f15 sqrt f5 cube *, f0 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f5 cube tanh sqrt sqrt, f13 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt, f11 sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt]
```

### Explanation:
- I retained the transformation depth from the first set and included additional transformation techniques from the second set, which uses a variety of scaling, trigonometric, and logarithmic transformations.
- Included advanced combinations of functions like `tanh` and `sqrt` that were present in both feature sets.
- Used scaling functions like `stand_scaler` and `minmax_scaler` to normalize the data, as they are beneficial in improving model performance by ensuring features are on a similar scale.
- Ensured a variety of transformations are applied to cover different relationships and interactions that could capture more variance from the original features.

```

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Keep the core transformations: `sqrt`, `log`, `stand_scaler`, `sin`, `tanh` as they often standardize data well and add non-linearity beneficial for models.
2. Utilize a combined transformation: `log sqrt sin` for `f4` as a standout complex transformation providing deep variability for `credit_amount`.
3. Combine `stand_scaler`, `cube` for feature `f3` permitting advanced scaling and expansion (potentially insightful for duration).
4. Preserve unique transformations like `minmax_scaler` for modified scaling needs.

We want to prioritize transforming features in a way that highlights nonlinear relationships and standardizes the data, as well as considering interactions between features. 

Here's an example of a better feature set:

```
[f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,

 f7 quan_trans, f10 tanh, f4 f9 minmax_scaler *, f17 stand_scaler f12 *]
```

Key improvements:
1. **Feature Interaction:** Including interactions such as `f4 f9 minmax_scaler *` and `f17 stand_scaler f12 *` to capture relationships between different standardized or min-max scaled features.
2. **Retained Key Transformations:** Keeping effective transformations like `f4 log f8 tanh *` which combines both logarithmic transformation and hyperbolic tangent, potentially capturing nonlinear scales effectively.
3. **Broad Transformation Coverage:** Including a mix of scaling (stand, min-max), non-linear transformations (sqrt, log, cube, reciprocal), and activation-like transformations (sin, tanh, sigmoid) to ensure comprehensive feature coverage.
4. **Maintaining Potentially Informative Transformations:** Keeping transformations from both examples that might be valuable (e.g., `f5 cube`, `f3 cube sqrt`) to maintain expressive power of the feature set.
