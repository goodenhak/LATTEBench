1. Utilize more complex combinations of the features, particularly `f4`, which relates to the target feature.
2. Integrate advanced transformations such as `tanh` and `sigmoid` to capture non-linear relationships.
3. Use differences and ratios, which may capture relative changes and comparative insights between the features.

- The focus on `f4` and combinations that involve operations such as differences and products with other features.
- Non-linear transformations (`tanh`, `minmax_scaler`, `stand_scaler`, `sqrt`, `reciprocal`) that might help in capturing complex patterns.
- The inclusion of the advanced feature set which utilizes both arithmetic and non-linear transformations aimed at capturing a wider variety of underlying patterns in the data.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

- Use of nonlinear transformations (e.g., `sin`, `tanh`, `cos`, `log`, `sqrt`) to capture potential nonlinear relationships.
- Combine features through multiplication or division to capture interaction effects (e.g., `f0 f3 *`, `f1 f4 /`, `f2 f4 tanh *`).
- Inclusion of each feature in its original form to maintain its initial information content (`f4`, `f3`, `f2`, `f1`).

This mix of transformations and interactions could potentially better capture the complex patterns in the dataset, aiding in the prediction of the son's current occupation class.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example.

The latest feature set example places a strong emphasis on transforming the `counts_for_sons_first_occupation` (representing it as `f4`) using various operations like standard scaling, quantile transformation, and complex interactions between transformations.

To create a new and improved feature set, we'll aim to integrate the emphasis on `f4` transformations and introduce a few more sophisticated manipulations:

```
[f4 ,f4 stand_scaler ,f4 quan_trans ,f4 f4 * stand_scaler ,f4 sqrt quan_trans ,f4 sqrt stand_scaler quan_trans ,f4 f4 f4 * * sqrt stand_scaler ,f4 f4 * sqrt stand_scaler ,f4 log stand_scaler ,f4 f4 cube quan_trans * ,f4 reciprocal stand_scaler ,f4 sigmoid ]
```

Explanation:
- The new feature set continues to transform the key feature `f4` using scaling, squaring, square root, and log transformations.
- Introduces complex combinations involving cube and reciprocal transformations combined with scaling or quantile transformations.
- These features should capture non-linear relationships and distribution nuances that aid in improving predictive power beyond simple categorical transformations.

- Combinations like `f4 cube quan_trans minmax_scaler *` aim to exploit non-linear interactions in the occupational count data.
- Transformations like `sqrt`, `log`, `reciprocal`, and `tanh` emphasize potential non-linear relationships.
- Subtracting other feature sets (e.g., `f4 f3 tanh -`) is inspired by the intuition from the second example, leveraging differential relationships.

This new feature set aims to provide a diverse range of transformations that can improve the model's predictive capacity by capturing both linear and non-linear relationship aspects.

Explanation:
1. Included feature transformations like stand_scaler, log, sqrt, and tanh to normalize and prepare features for potential nonlinear relationships.
2. Added arithmetic operations with subtraction to see the differences from f4, which is important for capturing deviation or shifts.
3. Added transformations based on trigonometric functions using existing features, which can be meaningful especially when dealing with cyclical or periodic data.
4. Combined certain transformed features like `f4 f4 tanh *` to explore compounded relationships.

This feature set intends to enhance the previous examples by exploiting both nonlinear transformations and deviations from `f4`.

2026-01-19 20:23:35,590 - INFO - llm output = To create a better feature set based on the given examples, we should aim to incorporate useful transformations and combinations of features. Let's analyze the operations and try to derive combinations that might capture important relationships or interactions in the data.

Here is a proposed feature set using postfix expressions based on the two given examples:

```plaintext
[f2 f4 tanh + , f3 f4 tanh + , f4 sigmoid , f4 tanh , f4 f0 - +, f4 f0 - minmax_scaler f2 + , f4 f1 - minmax_scaler f3 + , f4 f2 - reciprocal , f4 f3 - reciprocal , f4 tanh f4 sigmoid + , f4 f4 tanh * , f4 f4 tanh - - minmax_scaler]
```

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

1. **Feature Interactions:** 
   - `f2 f4 tanh +` and `f3 f4 tanh +` capture interactions between features and their non-linear transformations.
   - `f4 sigmoid` and `f4 tanh` represent non-linear transformations that help capture non-linear relationships.
   - `f4 f0 - +`: Combines interactions with a difference and addition to capture balance and interaction effects.

2. **Transformations and Scaling:**
   - `f4 f0 - minmax_scaler f2 +` and `f4 f1 - minmax_scaler f3 +`: These operations scale the feature differences, likely improving their utility in learning.
   - `f4 f2 - reciprocal` and `f4 f3 - reciprocal`: The reciprocal transformation can sometimes highlight important relative differences.
   
3. **Complex Interactions:**
   - `f4 tanh f4 sigmoid +`: A combined non-linear interaction that can enhance feature complexity.
   - `f4 f4 tanh *`: Interaction within a transformed feature.
   - `f4 f4 tanh - - minmax_scaler`: This captures complex interactions followed by scaling to ensure it is within a bounded range for better numeric stability.

These new features could help capture important relationships and improve the predictive ability of the model.

Let's analyze the transformations used in both examples and combine them to form a new feature set:

1. Use of `sigmoid`, `quan_trans`, and `cube` functions to introduce nonlinear transformations.
2. Use of combinations involving subtraction and trigonometric transformations like `sin`.
3. Combinations of transformations for creating interactions between features.

you can transfer features to get a new feature set which is represented by postfix expression. Here are features (f0,f1...,fn) and opearations (sqrt, square, sin, cos, tanh, stand_scaler, minmax_scaler, quan_trans, sigmoid, log, reciprocal, cube, +, -, *, /). Everytime I will give you two new feature set examples (the latter, the better), please give me one better according them. Keep the format the same as in the example. Do not use original feature names.

2026-01-19 20:24:32,142 - INFO - llm output = Based on the examples provided and the operations available, we can create a better feature set by incorporating transformations that may capture non-linearities and interactions between features. We'll utilize a combination of basic mathematical operations, scaling, and transformations to derive a potentially more informative feature set.

Here's a derived feature set:

```
[f4, f4 sqrt, f4 f2 tanh -, f4 f3 tanh - minmax_scaler, f4 f0 cos - tanh stand_scaler, f4 f1 sin - log, f4 log tanh, f4 reciprocal log tanh, f4 f2 * sqrt, f4 f1 f3 * - tanh, f4 minmax_scaler sqrt, f4 reciprocal cube stand_scaler]
```

Explanation:
1. Including basic transformations like `f4 sqrt` and `f4 minmax_scaler` to capture non-linearities.
2. Using `tanh`, `cos`, and `sin` with combinations of features to uncover potential interactions that affect the target variable.
3. Creating interactions between multiple features using multiplication and subtraction such as `f4 f2 * sqrt` and `f4 f1 f3 * - tanh`.
4. Utilizing `log`, `reciprocal`, `cube`, and `stand_scaler` to handle distributional skewness and enhance feature scaling and interpretability.
