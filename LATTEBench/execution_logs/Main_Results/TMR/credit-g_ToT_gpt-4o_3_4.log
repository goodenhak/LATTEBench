Devise the best possible solution for the task:
Possible next three steps:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}
                                                                      
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

Devise the best possible solution for the task:
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- duration: Duration in months (numerical), range = [4, 72], Q1 = 12.0, Median = 18.0, Q3 = 24.0, Mean = 21.0733, Std = 12.4448
- credit_amount: Credit amount (numerical), range = [338, 15945], Q1 = 1391.75, Median = 2356.0, Q3 = 4122.5, Mean = 3289.4300, Std = 2749.0204
- age: Age in years (numerical), range = [19, 75], Q1 = 27.0, Median = 33.0, Q3 = 42.0, Mean = 35.3267, Std = 11.3259
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross_savings_status_cross:  (categorical), categories = [<0_3386_<100, <0_1823_<100, ..., <0_4272_<100]
- checking_status: Status of existing checking account, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<0, 0<=X<200, no checking, >=200]
- property_magnitude: Property (e.g. real estate) (categorical), categories = [no known property, car, real estate, life insurance]
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, no known savings, 500<=X<1000, 100<=X<500, >=1000]
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [used car, radio/tv, education, new car, domestic appliance, furniture/equipment, business, repairs, other, retraining]
- own_telephone: Telephone (categorical), categories = [yes, none]
- checking_status_credit_amount_cross:  (categorical), categories = [<0_3386, <0_1823, ..., <0_4272]
- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9700, Std = 1.1260
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [existing paid, critical/other existing credit, delayed previously, all paid, no credits/all paid]
- employment: Present employment, in number of years. (categorical), categories = [>=7, unemployed, 4<=X<7, 1<=X<4, <1]
- housing: Housing (rent, own,...) (categorical), categories = [for free, own, rent]
- personal_status: Personal status (married, single,...) and sex (categorical), categories = [male single, female div/dep/mar, male mar/wid, male div/sep]
