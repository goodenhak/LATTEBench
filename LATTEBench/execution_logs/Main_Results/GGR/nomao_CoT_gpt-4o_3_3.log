You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

- Advice on semantics: Consider creating new features that combine multiple related features to capture more complex relationships between attributes. For instance, construct a feature that represents the average similarity across all clean name features (V1-V8) to reflect a holistic measure of name similarity. Similarly, create features that measure the aggregate similarity across city attributes (V9-V16), zip code attributes (V17-V24), and so on, as these can better capture the concept of similarity in the context of deduplication.

- Advice on data distribution: Examine the distribution of each numerical feature and create features that help mitigate any biases or skewness. For example, if you identify features with a highly skewed distribution—like those with median and mean far apart—consider log transformations or scaling methods. Additionally, design features that represent the range or variability, such as the difference between the 'intersect_min' and 'intersect_max' features per category, which can provide insight into the consistency of data entries across records.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

2025-12-01 19:16:52,904 - INFO - Critic LLM Output: Advice on Semantics:

1. Name Comparison:
   - Consider creating a feature that combines clean_name_levenshtein_sim (V3), clean_name_trigram_sim (V4), and clean_name_intersect_max (V2) using a weighted average. This could help capture varying degrees of name similarity in one consolidated metric.

2. Localization Consistency:
   - Develop a feature that aggregates location similarity metrics (city_intersect_max, zip_intersect_max, street_intersect_max, etc.) to generate a composite score across different levels of location data, potentially weighted by importance or variability.

3. Contact Information Check:
   - Generate a combined score for phone (phone_diff, phone_levenshtein, phone_trigram) and fax (fax_diff, fax_levenshtein, fax_trigram) similarities to assess consistency between instances.

Advice on Data:

1. Normalizing Scale and Range:
   - Normalize features like coordinates_long_diff (V109) and coordinates_lat_diff (V113) which have a skew towards higher values, using a log transformation to stabilize variance and improve model-fitting.

2. Handling High Frequencies:
   - Create binary features for extreme cases, such as geocodercountrynamecode_intersect_min (V81) or geocodercountrynamecode_levenshtein_sim (V83), which mostly consist of the same value, to indicate presence of default values without mixing them into other calculations.

3. Reducing Redundancy:
   - Perform principal component analysis (PCA) for features that are highly correlated, such as double, trigram, and term similarities, to condense the number of features into more effective summary components.

- Combining related features that measure similarity across different dimensions can increase semantic richness. Consider creating a feature that blends name, city, and zip code similarities. For example, averaging V3, V11, and V19 could provide a composite measure of entity similarity across multiple attributes.
- Use features related to geographic proximity, such as coordinates_long_diff and coordinates_lat_diff, to create a feature that encompasses geographic similarity, which is crucial for deduplication tasks involving location identification. Consider blending V109 and V113 to create a feature that represents geospatial closeness.

Advice on Data Distribution:
- Address skewed distributions by creating features that transform or combine existing ones to achieve a more uniform spread. Use log transformations on features with tight ranges (e.g., V93, fax_diff) to mitigate skewness and enhance variability, aiding in distinguishing merged spots better.
- Use ranking or bucketing in scenarios where features have limited different values and high concentration in some areas. For instance, bucket V7 and V8 into discrete categories representing levels of 'clean name including' and 'clean name equality' to differentiate levels of inclusion and equality efficiently.

Given the task of deduplication, focus on creating features that evaluate similarity across potential identifiers, such as location, name, and contact details. Combining features like name, phone, and coordinates using similarity measures (e.g., Levenshtein distance, trigram similarity) can provide more nuanced insights into whether two spots refer to the same entity. For example, creating a feature that aggregates similarity metrics across names using a weighted average can reflect the importance of exact name matches.

Example:
- name_similarity_aggregate: Weighted average of V3 (clean_name_levenshtein_sim), V4 (clean_name_trigram_sim), V5 (clean_name_levenshtein_term).

Advice on Data:
To improve distribution and mitigate skewness, consider transformations of existing features that balance the distribution. Log transformations can be applied to features with high variance and upper-bounded values to achieve a Gaussian-like shape. Consistently distributed features create better modeling conditions.

Example:
- log_transformed_city_similarity: Logarithm of V10 (city_intersect_max) plus V12. Balance distribution and emphasize pivotal points in data.
- combined_output_address_similarity: Average V65 (geocoderoutputaddress_intersect_min) and V67 (geocoderoutputaddress_levenshtein_sim) for smoother aggregation of final address matching.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

2025-12-01 19:19:07,173 - INFO - Initial critic prompt: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You are advising on how to generate new features by combining original features.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

2025-12-01 19:20:12,152 - INFO - Critic LLM Output: Advice on Semantics:
- Utilize text similarity features more deeply. Features such as clean_name_levenshtein_sim, city_levenshtein_sim, and similar can be insightful. Exploring combinations such as the average or minimum of these similarity scores can provide nuance in text data comparison.
- Consider using boolean or binary transformations to reflect critical matching points. For instance, V7 (clean_name_including) and V8 (clean_name_equality) are binary and could be effectively utilized as indicators of strong textual match or mismatch.

Advice on Data Distribution:
- Normalize features that have skewed distributions. Features like geocoderlocalityname_intersect_max and geocodercountrynamecode_intersect_min have medians and quartiles close to their maximum value, indicating potential use of normalization or scaling to improve the distribution balance.
- Consider logarithmic transformations for features with high mean values compared to their range, to reduce skewness or compress the feature scale. Features such as coordinates_lat_diff may benefit from this approach, allowing more nuanced modeling of variance across the dataset.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

2025-12-01 19:21:19,688 - INFO - Critic LLM Output: Certainly! Let's proceed with the advice from the two perspectives:

Advice on Semantics:
1. Levenshtein and Trigrams Combination: When dealing with text-related features like clean_name, phone, and geocoderinputaddress, combining methods such as Levenshtein distance, trigram similarity, and intersect metrics can create more semantically rich features. For example, compute the average, maximum, or weighted score of these measures to enhance matching performance. 
   - Example: Combine phone_levenshtein, phone_trigram, and phone_diff into a single feature to capture an aggregated similarity measure.

2. Equality and Difference Measures: For features where equality measures are involved, like street_number_equality or coordinates_long_equality, introduce weighted or normalized differences with other similarity metrics to add more context.
   - Example: Combine street_number_levenshtein and street_number_diff with street_number_equality for a comprehensive measure of address similarity.

Advice on Data:
1. Normalize and Scale Features: To handle skewed distributions, especially with ratio-related features like geocode_coordinates_lat_diff and geocoderpostalcodenumber_trigram_term, consider normalization or scaling to bring values within a comparable range.
   - Example: Apply log transformation to features like coordinates_diff to mitigate skewness and make the distribution more normal-like.

2. Feature Interaction: Explore interaction terms between high variance features such as clean_name_levenshtein_term and zip_trigram_sim or between similar attributes like geocoderinputaddress and geocoderoutputaddress. This can highlight high-level relationships potentially useful for classification.
   - Example: Multiply geocoderinputaddress_levenshtein_sim with geocoderoutputaddress_trigram_sim to create a feature representing the interaction of input and output address similarity.

These strategies can help in capturing the subtleties of deduplication and hopefully improve the model's predictive power.

2025-12-01 19:22:13,707 - INFO - Critic LLM Output: Certainly! Here's the advice based on the provided dataset and task:

Advice on semantics:
- Focus on combining features that directly relate to identifying duplicates or similarities in places, such as using multiple methods of string similarity or equality assessments. For instance, combining features like phone_levenshtein and phone_trigram could be informative in gauging how similar phone numbers are between entries.
- Consider creating features that measure proximity or intersection for geographic data (e.g., combining coordinates_lat_diff with coordinates_long_diff) to better evaluate the geographical closeness that might suggest duplication.
- Use grouping functions that can elevate categorical comparisons to imply potential duplications, such as evaluating equality across names or addresses with functions like equals or including.

Advice on data:
- Address skewed distributions or features that might be less informative by normalizing or applying transformations like log, square root, etc. This can enhance interpretability and model performance, especially when dealing with features like street_number_diff or coordinates_diff.
- Pay attention to features with small variance (fax_diff, website_equality) as they might need transformations (e.g., binning into categories) or different aggregations to improve discrimination capacity.
- Monitor high cardinality features or those exhibiting possible overfitting and consider dimensionality reduction techniques or feature interactions to enhance feature quality and relevance.

You are advising on how to generate new features by combining original features.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

1. Focus on address-related features: Given the task of deduplication, features related to address similarity, such as geocoderinputaddress_* and street_number_*, are crucial. Consider creating composite features that capture the overall similarity in address information. For example, combining V59, V60, V61, and V62 using operations like weighted averages or ratios may enhance the semantic capture of address similarity.
2. Coordinate-based features: Combine geocode-related features such as coordinates_*(diff,trigram,equality) to create features that describe overall geographical closeness or matching, which can be indicative of duplicate places.

1. Normalize distributions: Feature distributions that are heavily skewed, like V103_V107_plus_log with its range from negative to positive values, might benefit from transformation strategies such as log or z-score normalization to ensure they are more symmetric and better representative for model training.
2. Dimensional reduction and aggregation: Certain features like V80: geocoderpostalcodenumber_equality are uniformly distributed, which might dilute their influence. Consider dimensionality reduction or aggregation methods to synthesize features that capture variance across multiple similar features, potentially revealing latent characteristics indicative of duplication.
3. Handle outlier distributions: Features such as V117: geocode_coordinates_diff and other diff/equality features have narrow distributions near the high end of their range. Use transformations or binning strategies to ensure these features contribute effectively to diversity within the feature space.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

2025-12-01 19:24:10,610 - INFO - Critic LLM Output: Advice on Semantics:

1. Hierarchical Aggregation: Consider creating features by aggregating hierarchical information like geographical data (latitude and longitude), postal codes, and locality names. These features could capture data relationships more effectively by representing the inherent structure of the dataset (e.g., country_name_levenshtein_sim combined with geocoder_coordinates_trigram).

2. Contextual Pairing: Develop features that pair related attributes based on common contexts, such as pairing phone-related features (e.g., phone_levenshtein with fax_levenshtein) or street-related features (e.g., street_number_diff with street_trigram_term). This can help in capturing related discrepancies that occur together when records differ.

3. Semantic Similarity Metrics: Use similarity metrics like cosine similarity on text-based features (e.g., clean_name_trigram_sim and geocoderlocalityname_trigram_sim). This can help assess how similar entities are in a more nuanced way than simple string comparisons.

Advice on Data:

1. Normalization and Scaling: Many features have different ranges, means, and standard deviations. Normalize or scale features using methods like z-score normalization to make distributions comparable, especially when combining features.

2. Log Transformation: Consider applying log transformations to features with long-tailed distributions or high variance (e.g., coordinates_diff, city_levenshtein_term). This can help stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed.

3. Feature Binning: Group continuous features into bins to enhance the relationship with binary outcome variables. For example, street_number_diff can be binned into low, medium, and high categories to reflect meaningful differences.

Overall, focus on improving semantic alignment and data distribution of combined features to support the deduplication task effectively.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

You are advising on how to generate new features by combining original features.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

2025-12-01 19:25:13,105 - INFO - Critic LLM Output: Advice on Semantics:
1. Combining Location-based Features: Given that deduplication is about identifying if two spots refer to the same entity, consider creating features that effectively combine location-based metrics. For instance, utilize geocode_coordinates_lat_diff (V113) and geocode_coordinates_long_diff (V109) to craft a feature that represents a combined error or similarity metric for geolocation, potentially adding weights if certain errors are more significant than others.
   
2. Weighted Averages for Address Components: Develop features that represent a weighted or normalized similarity score for address components. For instance, you could combine street_number_diff (V97), street_number_levenshtein (V98), and street_number_equality (V100) to derive a comprehensive score indicating address matching strength. Applying weights to these features based on their relative importance can improve semantic insight.

Advice on Data:
1. Normalization and Scaling: Several features such as coordinates_lat_diff (V117) and coordinates_long_diff (V109) span a very narrow range near their maximum. Transform these to a more uniform scale, e.g., using min-max normalization, to ensure they contribute meaningfully in models sensitive to feature scale.

2. Distribution Enhancement through Binning: For features with a very narrow range or heavy skew like geocoderpostalcodenumber_trigram_term (V78), use binning to create categorical variables that can capture variance not visible in a continuous scale. This could involve using percentiles or standard deviations as bin thresholds.

3. Logarithmic and Polynomial Transformations: Features like clean_name_trigram_sim (V4), with distributions that could benefit from reducing skewness, should be transformed. Applying log or power transformations can stabilize variance and follow up with a standardization step for uniformity.

By focusing both on enhancing the semantic relevance of your features and improving their distribution characteristics, you can support more robust and insightful machine learning model training.
