You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Farm_Laborer, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsman-Construction, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Proprietor, Service_Worker, Operative-Manufacturing, Manager, Professional_Self-Employed, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Clerk, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional-Salaried, Craftsman-Construction, Farm_Laborer, Salesman-Retail]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.5, Mean = 17.2574, Std = 46.5042

Data Examples:
fathers_occupation is Operative-Nonmanufacturing. sons_occupation is Operative-Manufacturing. family_structure is intact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 195.6.
Answer: 0
fathers_occupation is Craftsman-Manufacturing. sons_occupation is Salesman-Nonretail. family_structure is intact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 31.4.
Answer: 0
fathers_occupation is Proprietor. sons_occupation is Farmer/Farm_Manager. family_structure is nonintact. race is black. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 0.0.
Answer: 1
fathers_occupation is Professional_Self-Employed. sons_occupation is Operative-Manufacturing. family_structure is intact. race is black. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 0.4.
Answer: 1


Operators:
['square', 'sqrt', 'cosine', 'sine', 'tangent', 'exp', 'cube', 'log', 'reciprocal', 'sigmoid', 'abs', 'negate', 'zscore', 'minmax', 'rank', 'bin', 'one_hot', 'label_encode', 'extract_time', 'is_weekend', 'elapsed_time', 'plus', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'mod', 'equal', 'greater', 'less', 'max', 'min', 'cross', 'concat', 'ratio', 'diff', 'bin', 'rolling_mean', 'lag', 'cumsum', 'groupbythenmean', 'groupbythenmin', 'groupbythenmax', 'groupbythenmedian', 'groupbythenstd', 'groupbythenrank', 'target_encoding']

###[]###,
complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
Possible next three steps:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Proprietor, Service_Worker, Operative-Manufacturing, Manager, Professional_Self-Employed, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Clerk, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional-Salaried, Craftsman-Construction, Farm_Laborer, Salesman-Retail]

- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]

The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.5, Mean = 17.2574, Std = 46.5042

- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Proprietor, Service_Worker, Operative-Manufacturing, Manager, Professional_Self-Employed, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Clerk, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional-Salaried, Craftsman-Construction, Farm_Laborer, Salesman-Retail]
- sons_occupation_race_cross:  (categorical), categories = [Farmer/Farm_Manager_white, Operative-Nonmanufacturing_white, ..., Craftsman-Manufacturing_white]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
