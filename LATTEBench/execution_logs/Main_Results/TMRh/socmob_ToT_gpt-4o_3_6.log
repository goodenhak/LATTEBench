You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Professional-Salaried, Proprietor, Clerk, Salesman-Nonretail, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Craftsman-Construction, Farm_Laborer, Laborer-Manufacturing, Salesman-Retail, Professional_Self-Employed, Service_Worker, Manager, Operative-Manufacturing]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Proprietor, Clerk, Operative-Manufacturing, Service_Worker, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Manager, Farm_Laborer, Professional-Salaried, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Craftsman-Construction, Laborer-Manufacturing, Craftsman-Manufacturing]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [nonintact, intact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [black, white]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.3, Mean = 17.5046, Std = 47.7540

Data Examples:
fathers_occupation is Farmer/Farm_Manager. sons_occupation is Service_Worker. family_structure is intact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 62.5.
Answer: 0
fathers_occupation is Operative-Manufacturing. sons_occupation is Manager. family_structure is intact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 26.6.
Answer: 0
fathers_occupation is Laborer-Manufacturing. sons_occupation is Clerk. family_structure is nonintact. race is white. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 2.3.
Answer: 1
fathers_occupation is Service_Worker. sons_occupation is Laborer-Nonmanufacturing. family_structure is intact. race is black. counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 10.4.

###[]###,
complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
Possible next three steps:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.3, Mean = 17.5046, Std = 47.7540
- race: race (categorical), categories = [black, white]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [nonintact, intact]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Proprietor, Clerk, Operative-Manufacturing, Service_Worker, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Manager, Farm_Laborer, Professional-Salaried, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Craftsman-Construction, Laborer-Manufacturing, Craftsman-Manufacturing]

Data Examples:
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 26.7. race is white. family_structure is intact. sons_occupation is Manager.
Answer: 0
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 16.2. race is white. family_structure is intact. sons_occupation is Professional_Self-Employed.
Answer: 0
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 30.4. race is black. family_structure is nonintact. sons_occupation is Farm_Laborer.
Answer: 1
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 7.4. race is white. family_structure is intact. sons_occupation is Service_Worker.
Answer: 1

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.3, Mean = 17.5046, Std = 47.7540
- race: race (categorical), categories = [black, white]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [nonintact, intact]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Proprietor, Clerk, Operative-Manufacturing, Service_Worker, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Manager, Farm_Laborer, Professional-Salaried, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Craftsman-Construction, Laborer-Manufacturing, Craftsman-Manufacturing]

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 12.3, Mean = 17.5046, Std = 47.7540
- race: race (categorical), categories = [black, white]
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [nonintact, intact]
- sons_occupation: son's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional_Self-Employed, Salesman-Retail, Proprietor, Clerk, Operative-Manufacturing, Service_Worker, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsmen-Other, Manager, Farm_Laborer, Professional-Salaried, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Craftsman-Construction, Laborer-Manufacturing, Craftsman-Manufacturing]

Data Examples:
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 5.1. race is white. family_structure is intact. sons_occupation is Proprietor.
Answer: 0
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 746.3. race is white. family_structure is intact. sons_occupation is Farm_Laborer.
Answer: 0
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 0.0. race is black. family_structure is intact. sons_occupation is Salesman-Nonretail.
Answer: 1
counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 0.0. race is black. family_structure is nonintact. sons_occupation is Salesman-Nonretail.
Answer: 1

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Output in Reverse Polish Notation. 

For example, suppose we have feature f1 and f2 and want to create a new feature:
new_feature = log(f1 + f2)
The corresponding RPN expression would be:
f1 f2 plus log

Instructions:
1. ONLY USE {} at the beginning and end of RPNs, use commas to separate multiple RPNs, and use spaces within each RPN.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. numerical_feature = categorical_feature label_encode
    2. categorical_feature = numerical_feature 5 bin (choose the best bin num you think)
4. The first parameter of groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
    For example: categorical_feature numerical_feature groupbythenmean

Output example:
{f1 f2 plus log, f1 f4 subtract, f1 sigmoid cosine}
                                                                      
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.
