# Reciprocal of the leading eigenvalue from adjacency matrix
# Usefulness: This feature transformation helps in cases where large values dominate the analyses by scaling descriptors on a smaller scale.
df['reciprocal_SpMax_A'] = 1 / df['SpMax_A']

# Explanation why the column 'LOC' is dropped
df.drop(columns=['LOC'], inplace=True)
# The 'LOC' feature does not show significant variance from the median in the context of significant predictors for biodegradability, having the least specific relationship with class labels.

# Explanation why the column 'B04[C-Br]' is dropped
df.drop(columns=['B04[C-Br]'], inplace=True)
# The 'B04[C-Br]' is often zero across samples and holds minimal variance, making it unlikely to contribute additional information not already covered by other features.

# Explanation why the column 'Psi_i_1d' is dropped
df.drop(columns=['Psi_i_1d'], inplace=True)
# 'Psi_i_1d' displays a narrow range of variation and potential outliers, which are not inherently valuable predictors based on existing domain knowledge to classify the samples.

2025-12-30 19:47:29,244 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for classifying the chemicals into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories, let's create new features using the specified operators and concepts of feature engineering. Below are some potential new features and reasons for their usefulness:

python
# Chem_similarity
# Feature created by taking the cosine similarity between SpMax_L and SM6_L, indicating structural similarities that might influence biodegradability.
# Usefulness: This feature captures structural similarity which could help in assessing the readiness of chemicals for biodegradability.
df['Chem_similarity'] = df['SpMax_L'] * df['SM6_L'].transform(lambda x: x / np.sqrt(np.sum(x2)))

# Polar_affinity
# Feature created by computing the product of J_Dz(e) and SpPosA_B(p) to assess the polarizability affinity; higher values could relate to higher biodegradability.
# Usefulness: Higher polarizability affinity between these attributes may suggest enhanced interaction of chemicals with the environment, affecting degradability.
df['Polar_affinity'] = df['J_Dz(e)'] * df['SpPosA_B(p)']

# Oxygen_ratio
# Feature created as the ratio of nO over nHM, the proportion of oxygen atoms relative to heavy atoms.
# Usefulness: The proportion of oxygen could indicate the potential for biodegradation via oxidation.
df['Oxygen_ratio'] = df['nO'] / df['nHM'].replace(0, 1)

# Nitrogen_presence
# Count of the sum of nitrogen-related descriptors (nN, nN-N, nArNO2).
# Usefulness: Nitrogen-related compounds can affect biodegradability due to interaction with environmental factors.
df['Nitrogen_presence'] = df['nN'] + df['nN-N'] + df['nArNO2']

# Aromatic_capacity
# Number of aromatic compounds computed as a sum of nCb-, nArNO2, and nArCOOR.
# Usefulness: Aromaticity can influence chemical stability and, therefore, its biodegradability.
df['Aromatic_capacity'] = df['nCb-'] + df['nArNO2'] + df['nArCOOR']

# Carbon_density
# Feature computed by dividing percentage of C atoms (C%) by the number of circuits (nCIR) plus one to account for chemicals without circuits.
# Usefulness: Ratio of carbon atoms to circuit structures, which may affect the complexity and biodegradability of a compound.
df['Carbon_density'] = df['C%'] / (df['nCIR'] + 1)

# Donor_ability
# Feature indicating the potential to donate H-bonds, sum of nHDon adjusted with nO and nN.
# Usefulness: Potential to donate hydrogen bonds, important in biochemical reactions relevant to degradation.
df['Donor_ability'] = df['nHDon'] + df['nO'] + df['nN']



Let's also consider dropping some columns based on redundancy or insignificant influence:

python
# Explanation why the column 'B01[C-Br]' is dropped
# The presence/absence of C-Br bonds at topological distance 1 shows low variance and may not significantly impact biodegradability predictions.
df.drop(columns=['B01[C-Br]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column 'B04[C-Br]' is dropped
# Like B01[C-Br], B04[C-Br] indicate low importance for biodegradability with little variance, making them less useful for prediction.
df.drop(columns=['B04[C-Br]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column 'nCRX3' is dropped
# This column shows very low variability across the dataset, suggesting it holds marginal informational value for classification.
df.drop(columns=['nCRX3'], inplace=True)


These features and drops are designed to retain attributes directly influencing chemical interactions and potential environmental degradation pathways, improving the prediction model's accuracy.

2025-12-30 19:47:45,683 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Here's an additional feature that can be engineered to further enhance the biodegradability prediction, along with an explanation for why specific columns may be dropped from the dataset:

### New Feature Engineering

python
# Feature name: bond_strength_index
# Feature description: Product of the sum of dssC E-states and the sum of dO E-states (SdO)
# Usefulness: This feature could represent the bond strength in the molecule, which may influence its resistance to chemical breakdown during biodegradation.
df['bond_strength_index'] = df['SdssC'] * df['SdO']


### Dropping Columns

python
# Explanation why the column F03[C-N] is dropped
# This column represents the frequency of C-N at topological distance 3, and its high standard deviation relative to its quartiles suggests it is not consistently informative for predicting biodegradability.
df.drop(columns=['F03[C-N]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column B04[C-Br] is dropped
# Presence/absence of C-Br at topological distance 4 shows high variance with predominantly zero entries, limiting its predictive power.
df.drop(columns=['B04[C-Br]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column N-073 is dropped
# Ar2NH / Ar3N / Ar2N-Al / R..N..R is mostly zero across quartiles, suggesting lower information gain for biodegradability prediction.
df.drop(columns=['N-073'], inplace=True)


### Explanation

- Bond Strength Index: By combining elements of atom connectivity and atomic E-states, the bond_strength_index potentially captures the molecular resilience against biodegradation processes. Unearthing the strength of chemical bonds may reveal why certain compounds resist or succumb to biodegradation more readily.

- Dropping Specific Columns: 
  - Removing columns with high zero frequency, negligible variance, or inconsistent information gain helps streamline the dataset, retaining only features that consistently contribute to the prediction task.

This feature engineering enhances the modeling approach by incorporating multicolumn interactions while preserving dataset efficiency through selective feature pruning.

# Explanation why the column B04[C-Br] is dropped
# This feature indicates the presence/absence of C-Br at a topological distance of 4, which shows limited variation and information gain as most quartile values are zero.
df.drop(columns=['B04[C-Br]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column nArNO2 is dropped
# Number of nitro groups (aromatic) feature has a near-zero mean and distribution across quartiles, reducing its informativeness for biodegradability prediction.
df.drop(columns=['nArNO2'], inplace=True)
end

These feature engineering strategies should enrich the dataset with meaningful attributes, while also eliminating less informative features.
