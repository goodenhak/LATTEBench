nHM nO plus log, nN nX plus log, nHDon nO nN plus plus log
}

Reasoning:
1. nHM nO plus log: The sum of heavy atoms (nHM) and oxygen atoms (nO) represents a measure of molecular size and oxygenation. Taking the log helps normalize the distribution and capture nonlinear relationships with biodegradability, as larger and more oxygenated molecules might degrade differently.

2. nN nX plus log: Nitrogen and halogen atoms (nN and nX) are often associated with recalcitrant compounds (e.g., in pesticides or persistent organic pollutants). Summing them and applying log transformation emphasizes their combined presence, which likely correlates with lower biodegradability.

3. nHDon nO nN plus plus log: Hydrogen bond donors (nHDon) plus oxygen and nitrogen atoms (which can also participate in H-bonding) indicates the total potential for hydrogen bonding. This is crucial for biodegradability, as H-bonding affects solubility and microbial enzyme interactions. The log transform handles skew and enhances predictive power.

These features combine chemically meaningful groups (size, electronegative atoms, H-bonding capacity) and apply nonlinear transformations to improve model performance on the binary classification task.

nO nN plus nHDon subtract, nCb- nCp plus nCrt subtract, nX nArNO2 plus nArCOOR plus nCRX3 plus nN-N plus
}

Reasoning:
1. nO nN plus nHDon subtract creates a feature representing the net oxygen and nitrogen atoms after subtracting hydrogen bond donors. This captures potential hydrogen bonding capacity and electronegativity effects that influence biodegradability.

2. nCb- nCp plus nCrt subtract combines substituted benzene carbons and terminal primary carbons while subtracting ring tertiary carbons. This captures aromaticity and molecular branching patterns that affect microbial degradation.

3. nX nArNO2 plus nArCOOR plus nCRX3 plus nN-N plus sums various functional groups known to hinder biodegradation (halogens, nitro groups, esters, CRX3 groups, and hydrazines). This creates a composite toxicity/persistence indicator feature.

}

Reasoning:
1. nO_nN_plus_nHDon_subtract is provided but seems incorrectly named as it subtracts? I create a more intuitive sum: nO + nN + nHDon. This captures the total count of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen bond donors, which are chemically relevant for biodegradability as they affect solubility and molecular interactions.

2. nCb-_nCp_plus_nCrt_subtract is provided but the operation is unclear. I create nCb- + nCp + nCrt to sum substituted benzene carbons, terminal primary carbons, and ring tertiary carbons. This represents a broader measure of carbon substitution patterns that could influence degradation pathways.

3. nX_nArNO2_plus_nArCOOR_plus_nCRX3_plus_nN-N_plus is provided but the exact operation is ambiguous. I recreate it as nX + nArNO2 + nArCOOR + nCRX3 + nN-N to sum all halogen atoms and specific functional groups (nitro, ester, CRX3, hydrazine) that are known to affect biodegradability, creating a comprehensive problematic groups indicator.

These features consolidate chemically meaningful groups into single descriptors that capture molecular properties relevant to biodegradation, potentially improving model performance by reducing dimensionality while preserving critical information.

2025-09-01 18:17:27,452 - INFO - LLM Output: {SpMax_L nHM subtract, nO nN plus nHDon plus, nX nArNO2 plus nArCOOR plus nCRX3 plus nN-N plus nCb- nCp plus nCrt plus subtract}

Reasoning:
1. SpMax_L nHM subtract: The difference between the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix (SpMax_L) and the number of heavy atoms (nHM) might capture structural complexity relative to molecular size. Larger molecules with simpler structures (low SpMax_L relative to nHM) could be more biodegradable.

2. nO nN plus nHDon plus: Summing oxygen atoms, nitrogen atoms, and hydrogen bond donors creates a composite feature representing potential hydrogen bonding capacity and polar groups. Biodegradability often correlates with hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding ability.

3. nX nArNO2 plus nArCOOR plus nCRX3 plus nN-N plus nCb- nCp plus nCrt plus subtract: This calculates the difference between problematic groups (halogens, nitro groups, aromatic esters, CRX3 groups, and hydrazines) and beneficial carbon structures (substituted benzene carbons, terminal primary carbons, and ring tertiary carbons). A positive value suggests more problematic groups, which typically hinder biodegradation, while a negative value suggests more favorable carbon structures.

Reasoning:
1. nO nN plus nHDon plus: Creates a comprehensive heteroatom donor index by summing oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen donor atoms. This captures the overall potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which are crucial for biodegradability as they affect water solubility and enzyme accessibility.

2. nCb- nCp plus nCrt plus: Creates a carbon complexity index by summing substituted benzene carbons, terminal primary carbons, and ring tertiary carbons. This captures molecular complexity and branching patterns that influence biodegradation resistance (more complex/branched structures are typically harder to degrade).

3. nX nArNO2 plus nArCOOR plus nCRX3 plus nN-N plus: Creates a functional group toxicity index by summing halogen atoms, nitro groups, aromatic esters, CRX3 groups, and hydrazines. These functional groups are known to confer chemical stability and toxicity, making compounds more resistant to biodegradation.

4. nO_nN_plus_nHDon_subtract nCb-_nCp_plus_nCrt_subtract multiply nX_nArNO2_plus_nArCOOR_plus_nCRX3_plus_nN-N_plus multiply: Creates a powerful interaction term that multiplies the three composite indices. This captures non-linear relationships and synergistic effects between heteroatom content, carbon complexity, and toxic functional groups.

5. nO_nN_plus_nHDon_subtract nCb-_nCp_plus_nCrt_subtract multiply log: Applies logarithmic transformation to the interaction term to handle potential extreme values and make the distribution more Gaussian-like, which often improves model performance.

6. nX_nArNO2_plus_nArCOOR_plus_nCRX3_plus_nN-N_plus nCb-_nCp_plus_nCrt_subtract multiply log: Another logarithmic transformation of an interaction term, specifically focusing on the relationship between toxic functional groups and carbon complexity, which is particularly relevant for predicting biodegradation resistance.
