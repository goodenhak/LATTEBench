}

Reasoning:
1. checking_status credit_history cross: Creates an interaction feature between checking_status and credit_history. The original dataset already has a cross feature (checking_status_credit_history_cross) which suggests this interaction is important. However, creating it directly from the base features ensures we capture all possible combinations and might reveal patterns the original cross missed.

2. credit_amount duration ratio: Creates a monthly credit burden feature by dividing credit amount by duration. This represents the monthly payment amount, which is a strong indicator of credit risk as it directly relates to the borrower's ability to repay.

3. savings_status credit_amount groupbythenmean: Calculates the average credit amount for each savings status category. This creates a target-encoding-like feature that captures how credit amounts typically vary with savings status, which can help the model understand risk patterns associated with different savings levels.
