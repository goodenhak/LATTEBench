2025-09-01 18:55:50,731 - INFO - LLM Output: To create new features that may improve the predictions of credit card application success, let's focus on combining numerical and categorical data in meaningful ways, and possibly reducing dimensionality:

1. Income to Debt Ratio: A person's ability to handle debt might predict credit card approval. By calculating the ratio of income to debt, we assess financial stability. 
   - RPN: {Income Debt divide}

2. ZipCode Grouping by Average CreditScore: Certain regions might show patterns in average credit scores due to socio-economics. Grouping by ZipCode and calculating the average CreditScore could expose valuable insights.
   - RPN: {ZipCode CreditScore groupbythenmean}

3. Employment Interaction with Industry: Employment status combined with Industry type could reveal insights into stable occupations or sectors more likely to have successful applicants. Cross interaction allows combining categorical features.
   - RPN: {Employed Industry cross}

These transformations aim to capture financial stability through income/debt ratio, regional credit score trends via ZipCode grouping, and occupational trends through employment and industry interaction.

2025-09-01 18:55:57,023 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating new features for the task of predicting credit card application success requires examining the dataset for high-impact transformations that could enhance prediction accuracy. Here's the proposal for three new features and their associated RPN expressions:

1. CreditWorthinessScore: Combine Debt, Income, and CreditScore to form a composite measure of an individual's creditworthiness. A high credit score and low debt relative to income are likely good indicators of creditworthiness.

   RPN: {Debt Income ratio CreditScore plus}

   Reasoning: A ratio of debt to income helps in understanding the financial leverage of an individual, which is a critical factor in creditworthiness. Adding the CreditScore to this ratio provides a holistic view of an individual's credit situation.

2. EmploymentStability: Calculate the product of YearsEmployed with a binarized Employed status to capture job stability. If employed and with substantial years, this will result in a non-zero value.

   RPN: {YearsEmployed Employed multiply}

   Reasoning: Long-term employment provides stability and reliability from a lender's perspective. By combining YearsEmployed with Employed status, we can emphasize the importance of continuous employment.

3. AdjustedRiskFactor: Consider PriorDefault and DriversLicense as an adjusted risk measure. If a person has a driver's license (implying responsibility), but also a prior default, it shows a nuanced risk profile.

   RPN: {PriorDefault DriversLicense subtract abs}

   Reasoning: A driver's license can be a proxy for certain responsibilities, such as paying insurance. However, its impact needs to be weighed against prior defaults. Taking the absolute difference between these two provides insight into risk adjusted by responsibility.

Final feature engineering expressions using the proposed logic:

Output:
{Debt Income ratio CreditScore plus, YearsEmployed Employed multiply, PriorDefault DriversLicense subtract abs}

2025-09-01 18:56:01,725 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the predictive capability of the model, we can perform feature engineering to create new features derived from the existing ones. Following are the three proposed new features and their rationales:

1. Employment Stability (Stability Score):
   Given that employment stability might be an important factor in credit card application success, it would be useful to capture the relationship between years employed and age. A higher ratio could imply greater stability in employment relative to age.  
   RPN: {YearsEmployed Age divide}

2. Debt Relative to Income (Debt Burden):
   To assess financial stress or ability to manage debt, calculating the ratio of scaled Debt to scaled Income can provide insights into a person's debt burden relative to their earning capability.  
   RPN: {Debt Income divide}

3. Prior Default Risk by Ethnicity (Risk Encoding):
   It can be insightful to encode the average prior default rates segmented by ethnicity, which could potentially reveal latent patterns of default risk across different ethnic groups.  
   RPN: {Ethnicity PriorDefault groupbythenmean}

These new features can capture deeper insights into a person's financial behavior and risk profiles, potentially improving the downstream classification task.

2025-09-01 18:56:07,505 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features created to help improve the downstream model's performance for predicting credit card application success:

1. Credit Worthiness Approximation: Combining CreditScore, Income, and Debt can provide an indication of an individual's creditworthiness. We can compute a feature that approximates this by calculating a weighted sum of these components, which gives a better sense of financial stability and credit history.
   - RPN: CreditScore Income plus Debt subtract absolute

2. Employment Stability: The combination of YearsEmployed and Employed status can give insights into employment stability. A feature can be created that adjusts for the employment status and normalizes the years employed.
   - RPN: YearsEmployed Employed multiply

3. Socioeconomic Status: We can create a feature based on a cross of Industry and Citizen and calculate the mean of Income within these groups. This provides insights into the socioeconomic status of applicants, which may influence credit card approval decisions.
   - RPN: Industry Citizen cross Income groupbythenmean

Thus, the output is:

{CreditScore Income plus Debt subtract absolute, YearsEmployed Employed multiply, Industry Citizen cross Income groupbythenmean}

2025-09-01 18:56:12,310 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions on credit card application success, let's consider the features and how they might interact to create meaningful new representations.

1. Income and CreditScore Interaction: Higher income can sometimes bolster the credit score, even if the credit score itself is low, due to the potential for debt repayment. We'll examine this relationship using a ratio and then squaring it to capture potential non-linear effects.

   {Income CreditScore ratio square}

2. Employment Stability: Being employed might suggest financial stability, particularly when coupled with the number of years employed. We'll capture this with a feature indicating employment stability using multiplication.

   {Employed YearsEmployed multiply}

3. Debt-Bank Customer Interaction: Customers who hold a bank account might manage their debts more effectively. Using groupbythenmean, we'll study the average debt load relative to the banking status and then calculate z-score for normalization.

   {BankCustomer Debt groupbythenmean zscore}

These new features try to capture interactions between financial behaviors, employment, and historical patterns relative to the dataset offered.

2025-09-01 18:56:16,774 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features represented in Reverse Polish Notation, designed to potentially improve the downstream prediction model's performance:

1. Income to Debt Ratio: This feature may capture the individual's financial leverage, indicating their ability to manage debt relative to their income. Higher ratios might suggest better financial stability, which could correlate with credit card approval success.

   RPN: {Income Debt divide}

2. Employment Stability Score: By creating a composite feature that combines YearsEmployed, Employed, and PriorDefault status, we are aiming to quantify an individual's employment stability and reliability. A higher stability score might indicate a lower risk for lenders, thus possibly affecting credit card application success.

   RPN: {YearsEmployed Employed multiply PriorDefault subtract}

3. Industry and Ethnicity Impact: A combined categorical feature that crosses Industry with Ethnicity. This can help capture interactions between job sector and ethnicity, which might influence credit risk profiles and application outcomes. 

   RPN: {Industry Ethnicity cross}

These features aim to provide insights into financial behavior, employment stability, and socio-economic factors, all of which can influence credit application success.

2025-09-01 18:56:21,750 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features for improving the prediction model's performance, let's consider some potential insights from the existing features and apply the appropriate operators:

1. Income-to-Debt Ratio: People with lower debt relative to their income may have higher chances of being approved for a credit card, as this indicates financial stability.
   - RPN: Income Debt ratio

2. Employment Stability Score: Being employed indicates financial reliability. We'll combine YearsEmployed with Employed status to create a stability score, and then apply a function to scale it.
   - RPN: YearsEmployed Employed multiply sqrt

3. Ethnicity Internally Ranked by Credit Score: Ethnicity might have different distributions in credit scores, especially considering the societal or institutional differences among groups. This involves ranking within each ethnic group before training models.
   - RPN: Ethnicity CreditScore groupbythenrank

Here is the structured output in Reverse Polish Notation:

plaintext
{Income Debt ratio, YearsEmployed Employed multiply sqrt, Ethnicity CreditScore groupbythenrank}


Explanation:
- Income-to-Debt Ratio: This feature could help assess financial health by seeing how much debt a person has relative to their income.
- Employment Stability Score: This gives a simple score indicating stability based on employed status and years of employment, which could influence credit decisions.
- Ethnicity Internally Ranked by Credit Score: This ranks individuals within each ethnic group according to their credit scores, which can capture variations that might be predictive.

2025-09-01 18:56:26,868 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the credit card application prediction model, we need to create features that could enhance the differentiation between successful and unsuccessful applications. Let's explore how this can be achieved:

1. Employment Stability and Financial Stability: Individuals who are employed and have a higher income or lower debt might be more stable financially. Therefore, creating a feature that combines employment status and a ratio of income to debt could give insights into their financial stability.
   
   RPN: YearsEmployed Income Debt ratio multiply

2. Credit and Citizenship Analysis: Analyzing the interaction between CreditScore and Citizenship might provide insight into how citizenship type affects creditworthiness. 

   RPN: Citizen CreditScore cross 

3. Industry Influence on Successful Applications: Industry might influence the likelihood of success in credit card applications. Using conditional probabilities of success per industry could enhance predictions.

   RPN: Industry 1 groupbythenmean

These features should add depth to the model by exploring relationships that wouldn't be captured by individual features alone.

Here is the output in RPN for the generated features:

{YearsEmployed Income Debt ratio multiply, Citizen CreditScore cross, Industry 1 groupbythenmean}

2025-09-01 18:56:35,213 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly, let's design three new features using the provided operators and existing features, aiming to enhance the predictive performance for the task of identifying successful credit card applicants.

1. Prior Default and Employment Interaction:
   Individuals with prior defaults may be assessed differently based on their employment status. Creating a feature that captures the interaction between prior default and employment status might shed light on potential risks or strengths.
   - RPN: {PriorDefault Employed multiply}

2. Income to Debt Ratio:
   This feature will highlight the balance between income and debt, which is a critical factor in assessing credit risk. A higher income relative to debt might suggest a better ability to manage financial obligations.
   - RPN: {Income Debt divide}

3. Average Income by Industry:
   The industry a person works in can influence their income capacity. By grouping by industry and calculating the average income, you can standardize and identify deviations from the norm.
   - RPN: {Industry Income groupbythenmean}

With these new features, we can capture interaction effects, assess financial stability more robustly, and account for industry-specific income profiles.
