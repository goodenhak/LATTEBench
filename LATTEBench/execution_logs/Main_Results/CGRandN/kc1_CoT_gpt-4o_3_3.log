2025-09-26 10:47:52,358 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the performance of the model predicting software defects, we can leverage feature engineering by creating new features that may capture underlying patterns not evident from the existing feature set. Here are three possible new features, along with the reasoning behind them:

1. Normalized Complexity Index: Combine and normalize various complexity-related metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, and design complexity. This could help capture an overall sense of the module complexity which might be associated with defects.
   - RPN: {v(g) ev(g) iv(g) plus plus loc divide}

2. Halstead Effort and Defect Pronness Combination: The Halstead 'effort' measure, when combined with code volume, might offer insights into how much cognitive effort is required relative to the size of the codebase, which could be a predictor of defects.
   - RPN: {e v divide log, e v multiply}

3. Operator to Operand Ratio: Analyzing the ratio of unique operators to unique operands could highlight potentially inefficient or error-prone areas in the code, as a high operator count relative to operand count might indicate complex or dense code sections.
   - RPN: {uniq_Op uniq_Opnd divide}

These new features aim to capture complex interactions and insights regarding code structure, cognitive load, and logic intricacies, potentially improving the predictive power of the model concerning software defects.

2025-09-26 10:48:01,680 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for the KC1 Software defect prediction task, we can engineer new features that might capture relationships or characteristics not currently evident in the original features. Here are three new features:

1. Feature 1: Combine McCabe complexity measures (v(g), ev(g), and iv(g)) and loc for a normalized complexity score.
   - Reasoning: Code complexity often correlates with defect likelihood. By normalizing these complexity measures against loc, we might capture a more nuanced measure of complexity in relation to the size of the code.
   - RPN: v(g) ev(g) plus iv(g) plus loc divide

2. Feature 2: Interaction between Halstead 'effort' (e) and 'volume' (v) using logarithmic transformation.
   - Reasoning: High effort and volume may suggest modules that are both complex and extensive, increasing defect proneness. The logarithm helps manage the magnitude of these features, potentially surfacing non-linear relationships.
   - RPN: e v multiply log

3. Feature 3: A ratio of comments and blank lines to lines of code to gauge documentation relative to code size.
   - Reasoning: Low levels of documentation relative to code might indicate rushed or incomplete work, which could be associated with more defects. This ratio captures the relationship between code lines, comments, and blank lines.
   - RPN: lOComment lOBlank plus lOCode plus divide

These transformations might leverage relationships that were less obvious in the raw data, potentially improving the model's ability to predict defects by providing new perspectives on code complexity, effort, and documentation completeness. 

Here's the output in the required format:


{v(g) ev(g) plus iv(g) plus loc divide, e v multiply log, lOComment lOBlank plus lOCode plus divide}

2025-09-26 10:48:12,551 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for the KC1 Software defect prediction task, we can create additional features that may provide more insight into patterns associated with defects. Let's design three new features using the provided operators and existing features:

1. Feature 1: Complexity Ratio  
   This feature attempts to capture the complexity ratio between the essential complexity and total operators in a module. A higher ratio might indicate concentration of complexity, which could be related to defects.
   - RPN: {ev(g) total_Op divide}

2. Feature 2: Normalized Effort Intelligence Product  
   This feature combines and scales the effort and intelligence of the code, considering that both high effort and intelligence might coincide with more defect-prone areas within a module. By normalizing, we attempt to reduce the effect of differing scales.
   - RPN: {e i multiply e zscore i zscore multiply}

3. Feature 3: Log of Line Count Ratio  
   This feature introduces non-linear transformation on the ratio of line count of code to line count and blank lines. It helps to capture the distribution of code and comments in the overall lines as defects might correlate with complex code documentation.
   - RPN: {loc locCodeAndComment lOBlank sum plus divide log}

These three new features aim to reflect different aspects of code complexity and structure, which may provide additional information that could be useful for predicting software defects in the downstream task.

2025-09-26 10:48:18,402 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the KC1 software defect prediction task, we can generate additional features by applying operators to the existing features. Here's the reasoning for each new feature:

1. Feature 1 (Complexity Interaction): 
   The interaction between McCabe's essential complexity (ev(g)) and Halstead's difficulty (d) could reveal complex modules that are prone to more defects due to high interaction complexity. This feature captures the combined effect of two different complexity measures on the likelihood of defects.
   
   RPN: {ev(g) d multiply}

2. Feature 2 (Normalized Effort):
   Normalizing Halstead's effort (e) by the line count of code (loc) might help control for module size when assessing how effort impacts defect prediction. Modules with high effort per line of code may have been difficult to write and thus susceptible to defects.
   
   RPN: {e loc divide}

3. Feature 3 (Z-score of Lines Count):
   Transforming the McCabe's line count (loc) to the z-score helps normalize the feature across its distribution, providing a standardized measure that can better differentiate between modules with excessive lines of code which could imply poorer maintainability or higher chance for defects.
   
   RPN: {loc zscore}

Together, these new engineered features aim to capture complexity interactions, normalize specific effort measures, and standardize code size, potentially improving the predictions by providing the model with more nuanced information about software quality factors associated with defects.

2025-09-26 10:48:26,440 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features generated using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):

1. Bug Prediction Using Weighted Complexity:
   This feature combines essential complexity (ev(g)) and the total number of operators (total_Op) to estimate the potential defect rate, considering both the complexity and the scale of the code.
   - Formula: (ev(g) * total_Op)^0.5
   - RPN: {ev(g) total_Op multiply sqrt}

2. Normalized Difficulty-Effort Ratio:
   This feature helps to normalize the 'difficulty' and 'effort' ratio to see how much effort is required for a given difficulty level. This could indicate potential areas where defects are likely due to high effort for given difficulty.
   - Formula: (d / e) * ((max(d) - d) / max(d))
   - RPN: {d e divide d max d subtract d max divide multiply}

3. Adjusted Line Count Coverage:
   This feature evaluates the line count of code relative to the line count of code and comments, weighted by the amount of blank lines, which could help pinpoint code density related to potential defects.
   - Formula: (loc / (locCodeAndComment + 1)) * (1 - (lOBlank / max(lOBlank)))
   - RPN: {loc locCodeAndComment 1 plus divide lOBlank max lOBlank divide negate 1 plus lOBlank max divide negate multiply}

These features aim to capture different aspects of code quality that could correlate with the presence of defects in the software modules.

loc total_Op divide log,
e_v_multiply_log i multiply sqrt,
loc lOBlank plus uniq_Op plus neg exp
}

Explanation:
1. {loc total_Op divide log}: This feature looks at the ratio of lines of code (loc) to the total number of operators (total_Op) in the code. Using logarithm helps in normalizing this ratio, especially since lines of code and number of operators can have a wide range of values. This feature might capture how dense the operations are within the code, which could correlate with defects.

2. {e_v_multiply_log i multiply sqrt}: Multiplying e_v_multiply_log by i and then taking the square root may capture complex interactions between these two features that relate to code complexity and intelligence. e_v_multiply_log already contains a logarithmic component, and i (Halstead's intelligence) represents a measure of the program's conciseness. The square root transformation helps in smoothing the values, which might improve model performance if there's a non-linear relationship.

3. {loc lOBlank plus uniq_Op plus neg exp}: This feature combines loc, lOBlank, and uniq_Op to assess their cumulative impact. Negating and applying the exponential function can be particularly powerful when modeling nonlinear relationships. The intuition is that more lines and operators (including unique ones) might indicate more complex code, while combining them using negated exponential transformation may highlight potential defects due to increased complexity.

2025-09-26 10:48:40,639 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the predictions in the KC1 Software defect dataset, we can create new features by combining existing ones using the provided operators. Let's identify potential relationships between features and hypothesis-driven combinations to enhance the model:

1. Feature Interaction between loc and total_Op: These represent the scale of the software module and total operators, respectively. It might be insightful to consider their interaction as large modules with many operators might have different defect tendencies.
   - RPN: {loc total_Op multiply}

2. Complexity Measures Combination: The variables e, i, and d are Halstead measures corresponding to effort, intelligence, and difficulty, respectively. Combining them could provide a comprehensive measure of module complexity.
   - RPN: {e i plus d plus}

3. Normalized Defect Prediction: The number of blanks and code with comments (lOBlank and locCodeAndComment) might be used alongside code size to normalize the potential defect predictor. Let's use loc for normalization along with uniq_Op.
   - RPN: {lOBlank locCodeAndComment plus loc divide uniq_Op multiply}

Here's how these transformations look using Reverse Polish Notation:

 
{loc total_Op multiply, e i plus d plus, lOBlank locCodeAndComment plus loc divide uniq_Op multiply}


These new features aim to capture interactions and comprehensive complexity measures that were not straightforwardly expressed within the original feature set, potentially improving the defect prediction model's accuracy.

2025-09-26 10:48:46,343 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features from the given dataset, we can leverage combinations of existing features using mathematical and statistical transformations. Here's a rationale for three new features:

1. Feature 1: Ratio of loc to lOCode
   - Rationale: Loc (line count of code) is a fundamental metric representing the size of the code module. lOCode (line count of code according to Halstead's measure) represents a similar concept but through a different lens. The ratio of loc to lOCode can serve as an indicator of code consistency or complexity, which might correlate with defect proneness.
   - RPN: loc lOCode ratio

2. Feature 2: Interaction between Halstead effort and difficulty
   - Rationale: Halstead's 'effort' (e) and 'difficulty' (d) are both measures of complexity that could be interacting to indicate potential defects. Multiplying these can capture interaction effects and potentially reveal deeper insights into the code's characteristics related to defects.
   - RPN: e d multiply

3. Feature 3: Cosine transformation of McCabe essential complexity
   - Rationale: McCabe's essential complexity (ev(g)) indicates the complexity of the program's control structure. Applying a cosine transformation could help emphasize non-linear relationships between the control complexity and software defects. This is a form of nonlinear feature transformation that might capture underlying patterns.
   - RPN: ev(g) cosine

Output:
{loc lOCode ratio, e d multiply, ev(g) cosine}

2025-09-26 10:48:51,939 - INFO - LLM Output: To create new features that might improve the downstream model's performance for the KC1 Software defect prediction task, we need to consider interactions, transformations, or combinations of variables that might better capture the underlying patterns associated with software defects. Here are three feature engineering suggestions, expressed in Reverse Polish Notation:

1. Feature Interaction: Create a feature that is the product of McCabe's line count of code (loc) and Halstead's difficulty (d). This might capture complex relationships between the size of the code and its difficulty.
   - RPN: {loc d multiply}

2. Non-Linear Transformation: Apply a logarithmic transformation to Halstead's effort (e) after adding a constant to avoid log(0). This approach can help in compressing the scale of effort, which has a large range and might be disproportionately impacting the model.
   - RPN: {e 1 plus log}

3. Composite Complexity Measure: Create a composite complexity measure by adding McCabe's essential complexity (ev(g)) and Halstead's intelligence (i), and taking the average of the two. This feature might capture an overall sense of code complexity better than individual metrics.
   - RPN: {ev(g) i plus 2 divide}

These engineered features aim to capture interactions and highlight areas that may correlate with software defects.

2025-09-26 10:48:57,569 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate useful features for the KC1 Software defect prediction task, we can leverage the available features and devise new ones that capture complex interactions or distinct patterns that might be indicative of software defects. Here are three new feature ideas using the given operators and the reasoning behind them:

1. Interaction between Halstead effort and intelligence: This feature captures the relationship between the effort needed and the intelligence required to understand the code. This could inform about the overall cognitive effort, which could relate to defect likelihood.
   - RPN: {e i multiply}

2. Complexity to Operators Ratio: By creating a new feature based on the ratio of McCabe's essential complexity to the total number of operators, we leverage information about how complex the methods are in comparison to the number of operations, which might be a useful indicator of potential defects.
   - RPN: {ev(g) total_Op ratio}

3. Logarithm of Cyclomatic Complexity and Lines of Code: The combination of cyclomatic complexity and lines of code (loc) can signify a potential defect area when logarithmically scaled, as highly complex and long code blocks are generally harder to maintain.
   - RPN: {e_v_multiply_log loc plus log}

The new features aim to capture relationships and complex dynamics that may be relevant to defect occurrences, considering both cognitive demands and structural attributes of the code. Here's the corresponding RPN representation of the chosen features:
