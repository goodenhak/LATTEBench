2025-09-20 20:20:59,180 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for the task of determining whether a person receives credit, we will create three new features utilizing the given operators and features. The choice of feature engineering is guided by the idea of creating meaningful interactions or transformations that may capture more complex relationships in the data, potentially enhancing model performance.

1. Duration Normalization: 
   The duration can be a crucial factor affecting the decision to grant credit. By normalizing it via Z-score, we potentially make it comparable across different scales, aiding in identifying patterns that are due to various durations.

   RPN: {duration zscore}

2. Credit History Interaction with Savings Status: 
   By creating an interaction term between credit_history and savings_status, we can reveal insights into how past credit behavior in combination with financial buffers (savings) affects creditworthiness. Using cross combines these categorical features into a single feature that encompasses their interaction.

   RPN: {credit_history savings_status cross}

3. Credit Amount to Disposable Income Ratio: 
   This feature represents how much the credit amount relates to the percentage of disposable income (installment_commitment). A high ratio might indicate burdening commitments relative to income, potentially affecting credit decisions.

   RPN: {credit_amount installment_commitment divide}

Output:
{duration zscore, credit_history savings_status cross, credit_amount installment_commitment divide}

2025-09-20 20:21:03,829 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions on whether a person receives credit, we can generate new features by considering interactions and transformations that capture patterns and relationships which might be crucial for the decision. Here's the breakdown for creating three new features:

1. Interaction between Employment Duration and Property Magnitude: 
   - The idea is to investigate if long-term employment coupled with ownership of valued property like real estate might influence credit approval positively.
   - Use the interaction between employment duration (as numerical) and property magnitude (as numerical via label encoding).

2. Savings Status and Credit History:
   - It can be insightful to capture the interaction between savings status and credit history to understand how one's financial background influences credit decisions.
   - Combine these two categorical features to see if any specific combination correlates strongly with credit approval.

3. Age and Existing Credits:
   - Age can play a significant role when paired with the number of existing credits to create a factor for credit risk assessment.
   - Transform age using sigmoid to compress the age range and interaction with existing credits to create a new feature that might reflect maturity in handling multiple credits.

2025-09-20 20:21:08,233 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the performance of the downstream model for predicting credit approval, I'll create three new features using a combination of feature engineering techniques, leveraging the provided operators and existing features.

1. Feature: Purpose and Employment Encode Cross
   - Rationale: Employment status and the purpose of the credit might influence the decision to approve credit. Encoding these two features and crossing them could reveal useful patterns related to specific combinations.
   - RPN: {purpose label_encode employment label_encode cross}

2. Feature: Credit Amount Duration Ratio Log Transform
   - Rationale: The ratio of credit amount to credit duration can indicate the intensity of borrowing compared to the term length. Applying a log transform can help normalize skewness and reveal proportional differences that may influence credit approval.
   - RPN: {credit_amount duration divide log}

3. Feature: Age Z-Score and Residence Since Multiply
   - Rationale: Age and the length of residence reflect stability and reliability. When combined, these features might provide insight into personal risk assessment. The z-score normalization of age ensures that its influence is scaled appropriately before combining with residence length.
   - RPN: {age zscore residence_since multiply}

These engineered features focus on enriching the dataset by combining potentially predictive aspects of individual behavior and circumstances.

2025-09-20 20:21:22,478 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we can create new features by leveraging different feature engineering techniques. Here are three proposed features with reasoning explained:

1. Combine Features Related to Employment and Credit Status:
   This feature is designed to assess how employment status correlates with the credit history. By using the groupbythenmean operator, we aim to capture the average effect of employment category on credit history, which could be crucial for predicting credit approval statuses.

   RPN Expression:
   {employment savings_status label_encode groupbythenmean}

2. Interaction Between Age and Credit Amount:
   This feature examines how age might influence credit amount. By creating the ratio of age to credit amount, the feature can indicate whether older individuals tend to request larger loans. This can be insightful as older individuals may have different spending habits or eligibility compared to younger applicants.

   RPN Expression:
   {age credit_amount divide}

3. Cross Interaction Between Checking Status and Property Magnitude:
   This feature captures the combined category of an individual's checking account status and their property magnitude. By crossing these two categorical features, we identify unique combinations which could have distinct impacts on credit approval.

   RPN Expression:
   {checking_status property_magnitude cross}

These features are generated to enhance the predictive power of the downstream model by uncovering hidden relationships and patterns within the data, thus boosting overall model performance.

For this task, we will generate three new features, keeping in mind reasons such as capturing non-linear relationships, leveraging statistical measures across groups, and improving categorical feature encoding.

1. Interaction Between Age and Credit Amount with Sigmoid Transformation: Given that age and credit amount have both linear and non-linear influences on credit decisions, applying a sigmoid transformation to normalize age before interacting it with credit amount could highlight potential nonlinear patterns.
   - RPN: {age sigmoid credit_amount multiply}

2. Groupbythenmean with Credit History for Employment Status: Understanding a customer's credit history could be augmented by analyzing average employment durations grouped by specific credit histories. This feature could unveil trends or risks associated with certain credit histories.
   - RPN: {credit_history employment numerical groupbythenmean}

3. Cross Feature for Property Magnitude and Savings Status: Crossing these two categorical features could provide insights into how property ownership combined with savings status affects credit reception decisions, as people with real estate and significant savings might be treated differently.
   - RPN: {property_magnitude savings_status cross}

These engineered features are designed to encapsulate interactions and transformations that may provide more informative insights to the model used for classification in the task at hand.

2025-09-20 20:21:32,572 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features for improving the downstream model's performance, I'll focus on interactions that might capture more complex relationships between the features.

1. Interaction between Income and Duration: It could be insightful to examine how the installment commitment (a proxy for income or capacity to pay) varies with the duration of credit. Longer duration might imply smaller installment commitments, affecting credit approval.
   - This could be captured with a ratio to see the proportion of income committed over time: installment_commitment duration divide.

2. Property Ownership Interaction with Personal Status: Combining personal status and property magnitude can provide insight into how these factors jointly influence credit decisions. Owning real estate might be a strong indicator of stability, especially when combined with certain personal statuses.
   - Cross categorical features: personal_status property_magnitude cross.

3. Age and Employment Stability: Older age coupled with longer employment stability might suggest a more creditworthy applicant compared to younger or less stably employed individuals.
   - Calculate the weighted influence using: age employment_label_encode_property_magnitude_label_encode_plus multiply.

These newly engineered features aim to improve the model's ability to predict credit approval outcomes by providing additional, nuanced insights into the applicant's financial stability and creditworthiness.

2025-09-20 20:21:37,539 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that might improve the downstream model's performance in predicting whether a person receives credit, we need to consider interactions between features and transformations that capture meaningful patterns or relationships within the data:

1. Credit History and Savings Status Interaction:
   The interaction between credit history and savings status may provide insight into a person's financial stability and behavior. We can further explore this interaction feature by converting it into a numerical representation that reflects the combined effect.

   RPN: {savings_status_credit_history_cross label_encode}

2. Duration and Installment Commitment Ratio:
   The ratio of duration to installment commitment can reflect how manageable the credit is over time based on the percentage of disposable income used. A lower ratio may indicate better credit worthiness due to a lesser financial burden relative to income.

   RPN: {duration installment_commitment divide}

3. Age Weighted by Existing Credits:
   Understanding how the age of a person interacts with their number of existing credits could reveal important patterns about credit behavior across different life stages. Applying a sigmoid transformation to normalize age ensures this interaction remains bounded and interpretable.

   RPN: {age sigmoid existing_credits multiply}

These features attempt to capture interactions and relative scales that more directly affect the credit decision, potentially improving the predictive performance of a downstream model.

2025-09-20 20:21:42,548 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that potentially improve the downstream prediction model's performance for credit approval, we should focus on interactions and transformations that capture meaningful relationships and patterns. Let's create three new features using the provided operators and explain the reasoning behind each:

1. Age and Employment Interaction: Understanding how age and employment duration relate to credit approval can be insightful. Older applicants with longer employment history may have higher financial stability. We'll create an interaction feature between age and employment.

   RPN: {age employment label_encode multiply}

   Reasoning: By multiplying age with encoded employment duration, we capture the relationship between an applicant's age and their employment stability, which could indicate a lower risk in credit approval.

2. Credit Amount and Purpose Interaction: The purpose of the credit request and the amount requested can impact the likelihood of approval. Certain purposes might be considered safer, and thus, less risky.

   RPN: {credit_amount purpose label_encode plus}

   Reasoning: By combining credit amount with encoded purpose, this feature captures the combined influence of how much credit is requested and what it is for, potentially highlighting low-risk combinations that might lead to an approval.

3. Housing Stability Feature: Housing status, such as owning a property, can be a strong indicator of stability, which might influence credit approval. We can examine this with the duration someone has lived in their current residence to see if stability correlates with credit eligibility.

   RPN: {housing label_encode residence_since multiply}

   Reasoning: Multiplying encoded housing status with residence duration can provide insight into the stability of living conditions. Stable housing can often correlate with financial stability, thus influencing credit approval chances.

Output:
{age employment label_encode multiply, credit_amount purpose label_encode plus, housing label_encode residence_since multiply}
