1. Deviation of the individual’s credit amount from the average credit amount for that loan purpose.  A borrower requesting much more than typical for their purpose may be higher risk.  
2. Interaction between checking account status (label‐encoded) and installment rate.  This captures how liquidity (checking status) and repayment burden jointly affect risk.  
3. Age binned into 5 categories to capture non‐linear age effects and group similar risk profiles.

2025-09-20 20:30:13,155 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features designed to (1) stabilize skewed distributions, (2) capture important interactions, and (3) borrow statistical strength from peer groups:

1. “sqrt of credit_amount_installment_commitment_multiply”  
   - Reasoning: credit_amount_installment_commitment_multiply is highly skewed (it’s credit_amount × installment_rate). Taking the square‐root reduces skew and makes the relationship with the target more linear.

2. “installment_commitment × age”  
   - Reasoning: interaction between how big a borrower’s payment rate is and how old they are. Older applicants with high payment rates may behave differently than younger ones.

3. “mean credit_amount_duration_ratio by job”  
   - Reasoning: different occupations tend to take different size loans relative to duration. Grouping by job and averaging the already informative ratio (credit_amount/duration) captures typical patterns per occupation.
