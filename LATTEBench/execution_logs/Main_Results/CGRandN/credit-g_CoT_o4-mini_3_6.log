1. Log of the ratio between credit amount and duration (“average monthly credit size”), which can capture non‐linear effects and stabilize variance.  
2. The mean credit amount for each combination of personal status and job (“socio‐demographic group average credit”), which brings in group‐level context about typical loan sizes.  
3. Binned age into 5 categories to model non‐linear age effects and allow the model to learn different risk profiles across age groups.

2025-09-20 20:33:16,621 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three engineered features with their reasoning:

1. Log of the credit‐to‐installment ratio  
   - credit_amount/installment_commitment captures how large the loan is relative to the borrower’s payment rate.  
   - Applying log reduces skew and stabilizes variance.

2. Mean credit amount by purpose  
   - Different purposes (e.g. car vs. education) tend to have systematically different loan sizes.  
   - A group‐mean encoding of credit_amount by purpose brings in this signal.

3. Interaction of checking account status and housing  
   - Combining liquidity (checking_status) with housing situation captures richer segments of financial stability.

1. Log of credit_amount divided by installment_commitment: captures the “burden” of each installment payment on the borrower’s income (normalized and log-scaled for stability).  
2. Age multiplied by duration: identifies long‐term loans taken by older applicants, who may have different risk profiles.  
3. Relative credit amount to job peer group: each applicant’s credit amount divided by the mean credit amount for their job category, highlighting over/under-exposure within the same occupation.

2025-09-20 20:34:21,298 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three engineered features designed to enrich the model:

1. “Monthly loan burden”: divides the total loan by its duration to capture the per-month payment size, a direct measure of repayment strain.  
2. “Relative loan size by age-cohort”: uses age bins to compute the average loan amount within each age group, so individual credit demand is seen in the context of peers.  
3. “Combined liquidity status”: crosses checking account and savings categories into a single feature, then label-encodes it to capture joint financial health.
