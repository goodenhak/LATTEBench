2. Average credit amount per purpose: purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean  
   – encodes typical loan sizes by purpose.  
3. Age buckets (5 bins): age 5 bin  
   – captures non‐linear age effects via coarse age categories.

Reasoning:
- “credit_amount duration multiply log” captures the interaction between loan size and term, with a log scale to reduce skew and highlight relative risk of large, long-term loans.
- “purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean credit_amount ratio” normalizes the loan amount by the average for that purpose, flagging unusually large or small credits relative to peers.
- “job personal_status cross” creates combined demographic segments (job × personal status), uncovering subgroup-specific default patterns.

2025-09-01 17:40:27,325 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features designed to capture different aspects of repayment capacity and risk:

1. “monthly_payment_ratio” – divides the implied monthly payment by the borrower’s installment‐to‐income ratio to approximate the absolute monthly burden in income terms.  
2. “purpose_deviation_interaction” – multiplies how far the requested duration and amount both deviate from purpose‐specific averages; large positive values flag unusually large or long loans for a given purpose.  
3. “credit_to_job_stability” – divides the purpose‐normalized credit amount by the applicant’s average job tenure, reflecting how large the loan is relative to demonstrated job stability.

Reverse‐Polish‐Notation for these features:

Reasoning:  
1. Applying a log transform to the loan‐per‐month ratio (credit_amount_duration_divide log) reduces skew and captures diminishing effects of large ratios.  
2. Subtracting the average ratio for the same purpose (credit_amount_duration_divide purpose credit_amount_duration_divide groupbythenmean subtract) measures how an applicant’s debt burden deviates from peers with the same credit purpose.  
3. Encoding savings status and multiplying by installment rate (savings_status label_encode installment_commitment multiply) models how savings cushion interacts with repayment load.
