Age Debt ratio log, 
YearsEmployed Employed multiply, 
Industry Income groupbythenmean
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: The ratio of Age to Debt (Age/Debt) can capture an individual's financial responsibility relative to their life stage. Taking the log helps normalize the skewed distribution that ratios often have, making it more suitable for linear models.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: This creates an interaction term that amplifies the employment signal. If someone is both employed AND has many years of employment, they represent a more stable employment situation, which is highly relevant for credit approval.

3. Industry Income groupbythenmean: This performs target encoding by replacing Industry categories with the mean Income for each industry. This captures the economic value of different industries while converting the categorical variable into a meaningful numerical representation that correlates with creditworthiness.

Age Debt ratio, 
YearsEmployed Employed multiply, 
CreditScore Income plus log
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio: Debt-to-age ratio can be a meaningful indicator of financial responsibility. Younger individuals with high debt might be riskier, while older individuals with low debt might be more stable. This captures an interaction between age and debt burden.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: This creates a feature that is non-zero only for employed individuals, with the value representing their years of employment. For unemployed individuals (Employed=0), this becomes 0. This effectively combines employment status with experience level.

3. CreditScore Income plus log: Combining credit score and income (both important financial indicators) and applying a log transformation helps handle the extreme right-skewness in Income while creating a composite financial strength metric. The log transformation normalizes the distribution and makes the feature more suitable for linear models.

}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio: The ratio of Age to Debt could capture the ability to manage debt relative to life experience. Younger individuals with high debt might be riskier, while older individuals with low debt might be more stable.

2. YearsEmployed Employed cross: This interaction feature combines employment duration with current employment status. Currently employed individuals with many years of experience might be more creditworthy than those with similar experience but currently unemployed.

3. Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean: This target encoding feature captures the average default rate by industry. Some industries might have systematically different default behaviors (e.g., stable industries like Utilities vs more volatile ones), which could be predictive of credit card application success.
