Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio: The ratio of Age to Debt could capture a person's financial responsibility relative to their life stage. Younger people with high debt might be riskier, while older people with low debt might be more stable.

2. YearsEmployed Employed cross: This interaction feature combines employment duration with current employment status. Someone who is currently employed with many years of experience is likely more stable and creditworthy than someone recently employed or unemployed.

3. Industry target_encoding: Industry type likely correlates with income stability and default rates. Target encoding will capture the historical success rate of applicants from each industry, providing a powerful predictive signal about industry-specific risk patterns.
