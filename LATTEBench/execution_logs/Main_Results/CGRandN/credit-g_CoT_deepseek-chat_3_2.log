credit_amount duration multiply credit_amount duration_credit_amount_ratio divide, 
credit_amount duration_credit_amount_ratio multiply duration subtract, 
checking_status savings_status cross
}

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply credit_amount duration_credit_amount_ratio divide: This creates a feature that represents (credit_amount × duration) / duration_credit_amount_ratio. Since duration_credit_amount_ratio is duration/credit_amount, this effectively calculates credit_amount², which captures the quadratic relationship of credit amount that might be predictive of credit approval.

2. credit_amount duration_credit_amount_ratio multiply duration subtract: This creates credit_amount × duration_credit_amount_ratio - duration. Since duration_credit_amount_ratio = duration/credit_amount, this becomes duration - duration = 0, but the actual calculation preserves the original values and creates an interaction term that might capture non-linear relationships between these important financial features.

3. checking_status savings_status cross: Cross-tabulating checking account status with savings account status creates a powerful interaction feature that captures the combined financial stability profile of the applicant. Those with both good checking and savings status are likely much better credit risks than those with poor status in both categories.
