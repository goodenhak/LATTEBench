2025-09-20 20:23:01,434 - INFO - LLM Output: When approaching feature engineering for credit prediction, it's essential to consider features that provide meaningful insight into a person's financial behavior and circumstances. The additional features should encapsulate various interactions and transformations that might reveal patterns correlated with credit approval. Here, I'll derive three new features using the operators and given features:

1. Interaction between Credit History and Purpose: The combination of credit history and purpose may provide insight into how a particular credit purpose affects riskiness based on historical credit patterns.

   RPN: {credit_history purpose cross label_encode}

   *Reasoning*: By combining these two categorical attributes, we might capture interaction effects between the client's historical credit experience and what they are requesting a loan for. Label encoding allows the model to differentiate pairs quantitatively.

2. Normalized Residual Credit Amount: Compute a scaled version of the credit amount relative to existing credits and normalize it. This would provide a measure of credit per existing credit account.

   RPN: {credit_amount existing_credits divide zscore}

   *Reasoning*: Scaling the credit amount by the number of existing credits may reflect the individual's borrowing behavior and risk associated with proportionate borrowing. Normalizing this feature could better handle variance and outliers.

3. Employment Stability Indicator: Establish a feature reflecting the employment stability by considering employment and residence duration as a compound measure.

   RPN: {employment residence_since cross label_encode}

   *Reasoning*: More stable employment and a longer residence duration generally correlate with financial stability. Cross feature creation followed by label encoding could reveal employment and residence patterns correlated with creditworthiness.

These new features aim to enrich the dataset with interaction effects and normalized measures, improving the model's ability to discern patterns pertinent to credit approval decisions.

2025-09-20 20:23:09,942 - INFO - LLM Output: To create new features that could potentially improve the model's performance, let's focus on interactions and transformations that could offer more insight into the data patterns.

1. Interaction between credit history and purpose: Combining these categories can help capture nuanced relationships between intended credit use and historical credit behavior. This interaction is already present in the dataset.
2. Adjusted credit amount based on duration: Incorporating the relationship between credit amount and duration can help assess affordability or risk. The longer the duration, the different risk assessment.
3. Age and job interaction: Age and job type can indicate experience level, stability, or risk. By crossing these factors, we might extract interesting insights about creditworthiness.

Here are the RPN expressions for creating these features:

1. Cross-label encoding between credit_history and purpose is already performed, so leveraging groupbythenmean to extract average credit amounts associated with each interaction level might be beneficial for risk assessment:
   - {credit_history_purpose_cross label_encode credit_amount groupbythenmean}

2. Incorporate duration in assessing risk of the credit amount by calculating tenure-adjusted credit amount:
   - {credit_amount duration divide sqrt}

3. Capture interaction between age and job for experience and stability assessment in credit worthiness:
   - {age job cross label_encode}

These feature engineering steps aim to provide more dimensions around risk assessment and credit analysis by leveraging the cross interactions and continuous transformations.

2025-09-20 20:23:14,268 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features generated to improve the predictive model's performance:

1. Create a weighted credit risk score using various numerical features. The idea is to give more importance to the credit amount relative to the applicant's age and duration. This could provide insights into how significant the requested credit is in comparison to the individual's capability to manage it.

   
   {credit_amount duration divide age multiply}
   

2. Generate a feature that combines multiple categorical attributes to capture more complex information that may influence credit approval. This combines checking status and savings status with existing credits to understand the financial stability and risk profile.

   
   {checking_status savings_status cross existing_credits label_encode}
   

3. Use groupbythenmean to get a mean credit amount by purpose, which provides insight into typical credit amounts requested for different purposes. This helps to assess whether a particular credit amount is unusually high or low for its stated purpose.

   
   {purpose credit_amount groupbythenmean}
   

These engineered features are designed to uncover additional relationships and insights from the raw features, potentially enhancing the accuracy of predictions in the credit approval model.

2025-09-20 20:23:18,694 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions, creating meaningful features by using the existing ones can help capture complex patterns or interactions. Below are three new features that might provide additional insights to a model predicting whether a person receives credit or not.

1. Income Stability:
   - Reasoning: The installment commitment relative to disposable income can indicate an individual's financial stability. This feature can be derived by considering the person's residence duration, number of existing credits, and monthly duration to understand how stable their income source is over time.
   - RPN: {duration residence_since existing_credits multiply divide}

2. Credit Health Indicator:
   - Reasoning: Combining the credit history with installment commitment and the checking account status may give a proxy of financial health concerning credit management. An individual with a certain checking account balance showing a history of paid credits with lower installments might have better credit health.
   - RPN: {credit_history checking_status cross installment_commitment label_encode multiply}

3. Age-Dependent Financial Responsibility:
   - Reasoning: Understanding the number of dependents and age can reveal how financially responsible someone may need to be. Older individuals might lean more towards providing for their dependents, influencing credit reception because of assumed financial maturity or obligations.
   - RPN: {age num_dependents multiply sqrt}

Generated features seek to explore various financial dimensions of an individual, including their credit management capabilities, stability, and responsibilities, which could directly or indirectly influence their likelihood of receiving credit.

2025-09-20 20:23:26,902 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that can improve the downstream model's performance, we need to focus on interactions and transformations that could capture potential relationships and nuances in the data. Let's examine possible transformations:

1. Duration and Credit Amount Interaction: Understanding the relationship between duration and credit amount is vital because longer durations with higher borrowing might indicate different risk behaviors. We'll use multiplication followed by a logarithmic transformation to capture this interaction.
   - RPN: {duration credit_amount multiply log}

2. Cross Interaction between personal_status and housing: These two categorical features can be crossed to capture possible socio-economic factors influencing credit risk.
   - RPN: {personal_status housing cross}

3. Target Encoding of job based on credit_history: Jobs might indicate creditworthiness when analyzed alongside credit history. By applying target encoding, we can transform job into a numerical feature using the average credit history score as a target value.
   - RPN: {credit_history job groupbythenmean}

These features aim to encapsulate interactions that could reveal more about a borrower's financial behavior and help improve predictive accuracy. The reasoning behind each suggestion is maximizing potential information extraction from both numerical transformations and categorical interactions.

2025-09-20 20:23:31,369 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream prediction task of whether a person receives a credit, I will generate three new features using feature engineering:

1. Interaction between checking account status and savings status: People with higher savings and better checking account statuses might be more likely to receive credit. By combining these two categorical attributes, we can capture this interaction.

   RPN: {checking_status savings_status cross label_encode}

2. Credit amount adjusted by disposable income commitment: The ratio of credit amount to the percentage of disposable income committed towards installments provides insight into how burdensome the credit might be for the individual. A lower ratio might imply a more manageable credit for the person.

   RPN: {credit_amount installment_commitment divide}

3. Age and residence combined feature: By multiplying age and years of residence, we might capture a stability metric. An older individual with longer residence might be perceived as having more stable circumstances.

   RPN: {age residence_since multiply}

These engineered features aim to capture complex interactions and make distinctions between individuals more pronounced in the model, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

2025-09-20 20:23:35,391 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the information provided, we will create three new features using feature engineering. Here's the reasoning for each of the features created:

1. Feature 1: Ratio of Credit Amount to Duration
   - The rationale is to create a feature that represents how much credit is allocated per month of duration. This may help discern between short-term and long-term commitment relative to the amount borrowed.
   - RPN Expression: credit_amount duration divide

2. Feature 2: Interaction between Checking Status and Savings Status
   - By creating an interaction, it combines the existing checking status with savings status, which could reflect one's overall short-term financial liquidity situation. This interaction can provide deeper insights into the person’s financial habits.
   - RPN Expression: checking_status savings_status cross

3. Feature 3: Z-score of Credit Amount
   - This transformation helps normalize the credit amount, considering how far the individual’s credit request deviates from the mean across the dataset. It helps standardize the credit amount feature to emphasize its importance relative to others without being obscured by extreme values.
   - RPN Expression: credit_amount zscore

2025-09-20 20:23:39,331 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the performance of the downstream model in predicting whether a person receives credit, we can engineer new features as follows:

1. Savings vs Checking Interaction: The relationship between savings and checking account status might provide insights into financial stability. By using the cross operator, we can capture the combined effect.
   - RPN: savings_status checking_status cross

2. Installment Impact Per Credit: Understanding the financial burden per existing credit might help assess the risk profile better. We calculate the installment commitment relative to the number of existing credits.
   - RPN: installment_commitment existing_credits divide

3. Credit Duration Z-Score: Normalizing the credit duration feature through a z-score transformation allows us to capture how much an individual's credit duration deviates from the average, which might be indicative of risk.
   - RPN: duration duration zscore

The final output in Reverse Polish Notation with these features is:
{savings_status checking_status cross, installment_commitment existing_credits divide, duration duration zscore}
