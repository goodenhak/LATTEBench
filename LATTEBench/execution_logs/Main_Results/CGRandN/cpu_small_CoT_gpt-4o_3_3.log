Reasoning:

1. {lread rchar multiply sqrt}: This feature captures the interaction between lread and rchar, which are both measures related to reading operations. Taking the square root of their product can help reduce the skewness and may capture the nonlinear relationship impacting the CPU's user mode time.

2. {lwrite lread ratio log}: This feature is the logarithm of the ratio of lwrite to lread. This transformation could highlight how the relative balance between reading and writing operations affects the CPU's performance in user mode. Taking the logarithm helps in managing the scale and skewness.

3. {freemem rchar divide exp}: This feature uses freemem divided by rchar, capturing the efficiency of memory available per character read. Using an exponential transformation can emphasize instances where this ratio is small but impactful on CPU user mode time.

2025-10-15 20:30:14,781 - INFO - LLM Output: {scall sread plus log, rchar wchar ratio sqrt, runqsz freemem ratio exp}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. scall sread plus log: System calls and system read calls are typically good indicators of how much user-level activity is occurring. By summing the number of system calls and system read calls and applying a logarithmic transformation, we can capture a nonlinear relationship that may help in predicting CPU usage in user mode.

2. rchar wchar ratio sqrt: The ratio of characters read to characters written can indicate the nature of workload, e.g., read-heavy or write-heavy tasks. Taking the square root of this ratio helps in normalizing any skewness in the distribution, which may help the model to better learn from the feature.

3. runqsz freemem ratio exp: The ratio of the run queue size to free memory available gives an idea of the system's load and available resources. Using an exponential transformation can capture exponential growth behavior, which is common in computing workloads as resources become constrained, potentially surfacing nonlinear effects in relation to CPU usage prediction.

2025-10-15 20:30:35,498 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar sread divide log, scall runqsz multiply sqrt, exec fork greater lread label_encode subtract}

Explanation:
1. rchar sread divide log: This feature takes the ratio of characters transferred per read call and applies logarithmic transformation to potentially reveal non-linear relationships between rchar and sread. This transformation can capture how effectively the system handles read operations in terms of character transfer, which might relate to user-mode CPU time if this represents efficient handling of data.

2. scall runqsz multiply sqrt: By multiplying scall (system calls per second) with runqsz (process run queue size) and applying a square root transformation, we can create a feature that reflects the intensity of system usage. A high number of system calls with a large queue size may indicate heavy, user-involved processing, which could correlate with more time spent in user mode.

3. exec fork greater lread label_encode subtract: This feature involves checking if the number of exec calls is greater than fork calls, creating a binary feature (categorical). This result is then label encoded and subtracted from lread to create a new feature. The idea is to determine how the relationship between exec and fork calls might impact memory reads (lread), adding insight into how concurrent process handling might influence user-mode CPU time.

2025-10-15 20:30:54,383 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar sread divide sqrt, exec fork plus log, freemem freeswap ratio}

some reasoning/explanation:

1. rchar sread divide sqrt: This feature captures the relationship between the number of characters transferred during system reads (rchar) relative to the system read calls (sread). Taking the square root of this ratio may help stabilize variance and handle non-linearity, potentially highlighting more subtle relationships between data throughput and CPU usage.

2. exec fork plus log: By capturing the combined frequency of exec and fork system calls and then applying a logarithmic transformation, this feature can emphasize the impact of concurrent process execution and new processes on system CPU usage. The log transformation is useful for managing skewness in the distribution of summed system call frequencies.

3. freemem freeswap ratio: This feature analyzes the proportion of free memory to available swap space. It reflects the balance between RAM and swap usage, which can influence the CPU's ability to efficiently run processes in user mode. The ratio helps elucidate memory resource utilization patterns which are critical for predicting CPU performance, especially in environments where memory is a frequent bottleneck.

2025-10-15 20:31:47,880 - INFO - LLM Output: {freemem freemem multiply sqrt, lread swrite rchar multiply plus, rchar wchar ratio log}

1. {freemem freemem multiply sqrt}:
   - This feature calculates the square root of the square of freemem, essentially normalizing the freemem values which might stabilize variance and help models that are sensitive to skewed data. By doing this transformation, we are emphasizing the role of freemem with a certain level of non-linearity which might be useful for capturing variations in memory availability related to CPU usage.

2. {lread swrite rchar multiply plus}:
   - This feature sums lread and the product of swrite and rchar. The idea is to incorporate memory read actions together with interactions between write actions and the amount of characters. This might help in capturing complex relationships where the volume and interaction of read and write operations predict CPU user time.

3. {rchar wchar ratio log}:
   - Taking the logarithm of the ratio of rchar to wchar can help to stabilize the variance and highlight the relative difference between read and write actions at a character level. The log transformation is useful for skewed distributions and may help to better capture dependencies on rchar and wchar relevant to user mode time.

These transformations are designed to extract non-linear patterns and interactions in the data which might be critical for improving the prediction accuracy of time that CPUs run in user mode.

2025-10-15 20:32:12,578 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar sread divide log, exec fork plus log, scall runqsz multiply sqrt}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. rchar sread divide log: This feature reflects the logarithmic ratio between the number of characters transferred by system read calls and the number of system read calls. It provides insight into how efficiently characters are being read, which could affect user mode CPU usage if character-intensive processes are running.

2. exec fork plus log: This captures the logarithm of the sum of exec and fork calls per second. Both exec and fork are operations that impact process creation and management, influencing CPU utilization. Monitoring the combination of these calls and transforming it logarithmically can provide a smoother feature for modeling.

3. scall runqsz multiply sqrt: This computes the square root of the product of system calls and process run queue size. The number of system calls can affect CPU load, while the run queue size indicates the demand for CPU time. Combining both through multiplication and square root helps to represent their joint impact on CPU operations.

These three engineered features aim to extract distinct characteristics related to processes and memory management that are likely important for predicting CPU user mode time.

2025-10-15 20:32:33,915 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread sread plus log, scall rchar divide sqrt, exec fork plus reciprocal}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. lread sread plus log: This feature combines two key metrics related to memory operations, lread and sread, by summing them and then applying the logarithm. The log transformation can normalize the distribution of the feature, potentially making it more predictive, given that these operations likely correlate with CPU activity.

2. scall rchar divide sqrt: By dividing the number of system calls (scall) by the number of characters read (rchar), we derive a rate that could indicate the efficiency or intensity of system activity in user mode. Applying the square root can help stabilize variance and further normalize the data for better model predictions.

3. exec fork plus reciprocal: The sum of exec and fork provides a measure of the combined load from these process management operations. Taking the reciprocal can highlight instances where this load is low, potentially highlighting periods when user mode CPU usage might be higher due to lower management overhead.

1. {freemem freeswap ratio log}: This feature takes the ratio of freemem and freeswap, which provides a sense of memory usage efficiency, and then applies the logarithm to mitigate the effects of extreme values and reduce skewness, potentially helping the model better understand memory-related features.

2. {scall swrite plus sqrt}: This feature sums the number of system calls (scall) and system write calls (swrite), then takes the square root to adjust the scale and distribute the range more closely to mean values. This transformation can highlight the combined impact of system resource usage in a less biased manner.

3. {runqsz exec multiply reciprocate}: This feature multiplies the process run queue size (runqsz) by the number of system exec calls (exec), and then takes the reciprocal. This transformation emphasizes the impact of simultaneous high queue sizes and execution counts, potentially influencing user-mode timing predictions due to resource contention.

2025-10-15 20:33:43,970 - INFO - LLM Output: {runqsz exec multiply sqrt, rchar sread divide minmax, scap freemem ratio log}

Explanation:
1. runqsz exec multiply sqrt: This RPN creates a new feature by multiplying the run queue size (runqsz) with the system exec calls per second (exec) and taking the square root of the result. This feature could help capture the interaction and balance between process execution and CPU accessibility more effectively, as both features relate to CPU usage.

2. rchar sread divide minmax: This feature calculates the ratio of characters transferred per second by system read calls (rchar) and the number of system read calls per second (sread), followed by applying min-max normalization. The ratio gives an idea of the average size of data read per system call, which can be directly indicative of CPU usage. Normalizing the data ensures it's on the same scale as other features.

3. scall freemem ratio log: The system calls per second (scall) to available memory pages (freemem) ratio is transformed using a logarithmic function. This feature is designed to understand the relationship between system calls and memory availability, which can indirectly impact CPU utilization. The log transformation helps in managing any skewness in the data distribution, potentially improving prediction.

These engineered features incorporate both primary interactions and nonlinear transformations that potentially capture complex patterns in the data better than original features alone.
