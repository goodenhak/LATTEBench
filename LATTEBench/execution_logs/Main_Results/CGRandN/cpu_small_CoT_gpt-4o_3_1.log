2025-10-15 17:45:50,544 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread lwrite plus sread scall plus plus, rchar wchar ratio , freemem freemem log bin}

Explanation:
1. {lread lwrite plus sread scall plus plus}: This feature aggregates the read and write operations (both logical and system reads) into a single feature, which might capture the overall I/O activity impacting CPU usage. Adding these elements creates a synthetic feature representing the combined data movement between user and system memory with system calls.

2. {rchar wchar ratio}: This generates a feature representing the ratio between characters read and written via system calls. It could provide insight into whether reading or writing is more dominant and how each affects CPU user mode, especially if there's a specific balance that affects performance.

3. {freemem freemem log bin}: By applying a logarithmic transformation on the freemem feature and binning it, we mitigate any skewness in memory availability. This can make relationships linear, possibly better suited for prediction tasks, while binning can capture non-linear associations in discrete groupings.

2025-10-15 17:46:11,164 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread scall multiply sqrt, runqsz freemem ratio log, fork exec multiply zscore}

### Reasoning/Explanation:
1. lread scall multiply sqrt: 
   - This feature takes the product of the number of reads (lread) and the number of system calls (scall), then calculates the square root. The multiplication captures the interaction between memory reads and system activity, while the square root smooths out the influence of high values, which can be significant given the wide range of both values.

2. runqsz freemem ratio log: 
   - By calculating the log of the ratio between process run queue size (runqsz) and free memory available (freemem), this feature emphasizes situations where there's high demand on the CPU coupled with limited memory availability, which could be a critical factor in predicting CPU usage.

3. fork exec multiply zscore: 
   - Multiplying fork and exec call rates highlights the combined influence of process creation (fork) and execution (exec) intensity. Applying z-score standardization helps in normalizing the feature across its values, thus minimizing the impact of potential outliers in these operations which are crucial for user mode CPU operations.

2025-10-15 17:46:29,943 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar wchar plus log, scall sread ratio, freemem exec multiply sqrt}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. {rchar wchar plus log}: This feature combines rchar and wchar (the number of characters transferred per second by read and write calls, respectively) and then applies a logarithmic transformation. Combining the read and write operations can give an overall picture of data throughput, and log transformation is beneficial to handle the right-skewed distribution of the data, making it more suitable for many machine learning models.

2. {scall sread ratio}: This feature calculates the ratio of scall (system calls) to sread (system read calls), which can give insights into how much of the system's capabilities are being utilized for reading as opposed to other operations. The ratio can help in understanding the load distribution between total system calls and those dedicated to reading.

3. {freemem exec multiply sqrt}: This feature multiplies freemem (free memory pages available) by exec (number of exec calls per second) and then takes the square root. The idea here is to capture the interaction between available memory and the number of execution processes, which could affect CPU usage. Square root is applied to mitigate large variances and bring numerical stability during model training.

The creation of these new features is aimed at providing better predictors for the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode:

1. {lread lwrite plus scall subtract fork multiply}: This feature combines lread and lwrite, subtracts scall, and then multiplies by fork. This can capture complex interactions between memory access and system call activity, potentially correlating with CPU's user mode activity.

2. {rchar wchar plus freemem divide log}: This feature combines the character transfer rates (rchar and wchar), adjusts for the available free memory by division, and applies a log transformation. This can highlight the relationship between data transfer intensity and available resources.

3. {scall sread ratio scall_sread_ratio divide log}: By dividing the ratio of system calls to reads by the existing scall_sread_ratio and applying a log transformation, this feature may reveal nonlinear relations in system call patterns that affect CPU performance.

2025-10-15 17:47:33,350 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar wchar plus log, lread scall divide, freemem fork exec plus multiply}

Reasoning/Explanation:
1. rchar wchar plus log: By creating a feature that combines rchar and wchar through addition followed by a logarithm operation, we capture the relationship between read and write operations in terms of data transferred. This accounts for both read and write efficiencies and scales down large values, which might help the model interpret the relationship properly.

2. lread scall divide: Dividing lread by scall can provide insights into how read operations between system and user memory relate to the total number of system calls. If more system calls result in less reads, it might have a meaningful impact on CPU usage patterns.

3. freemem fork exec plus multiply: Combining fork and exec with addition (as they both pertain to process creation and management) and then multiplying with freemem can give insights into how available memory resources are utilized in process management, which could impact CPU usage in user mode.

By generating new features, we can attempt to capture additional patterns or relationships within the data that might be useful for predicting the portion of time that CPUs run in user mode. Here's the reasoning behind each new feature:

1. {lread swrite plus ratio}: This ratio of lread and swrite captures the balance between read and write operations to/from memory. A relative measure like this could identify patterns where the CPU's user mode time depends on the type of memory access.

2. {scall sread scall_sread_ratio multiply divide}: This feature scales the scall value by the scall_sread_ratio factor, then divides by sread. This attempts to capture the system calls' relative intensity, taking into account the existing relationship with sread, possibly explaining simultaneous impacts on CPU user mode usage.

3. {runqsz freemem plus sqrt}: Adding runqsz (process run queue size) with freemem (free memory) and then computing the square root helps capture situations where a congestion of processes with varying memory availability may impact CPU utilization. This can give a sense of resource availability and process load on the system.

2025-10-15 17:48:18,635 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread lwrite plus sqrt, runqsz freemem multiply sqrt, scall sread swrite plus plus reciprocal}

Reasoning/Explanation:
1. lread lwrite plus sqrt: Combining lread and lwrite by summing them and taking the square root provides a feature that captures the intensity of memory transfers between system memory and user memory. This could correlate with CPU usage in user mode as higher transfer rates might indicate more user-driven processes.
   
2. runqsz freemem multiply sqrt: The product of runqsz (process run queue size) and freemem (available memory pages) provides insight into the system's resource utilization. Taking the square root helps normalize this product and could relate to CPU user mode usage similarly to a capacity utilization metric.

3. scall sread swrite plus plus reciprocal: Summing scall, sread, and swrite reflects overall system call activity. Taking the reciprocal might capture how a high rate of system activity correlates with less available CPU time for user mode operations, providing an inverse relationship to user mode usage.

2025-10-15 17:48:41,149 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar wchar plus sqrt, scall sread divide ratio, exec fork plus log}

Reasoning/Explanation:
1. rchar wchar plus sqrt: This feature captures the combined data transfer volume and normalizes it with the square root transformation. Using the square root helps manage variability in the large ranges presented by rchar and wchar, potentially revealing a more linear relationship with the predictor.

2. scall sread divide ratio: Calculates the ratio of system calls to actual read calls, which could indicate system performance pressure or resource bottlenecks. Understanding this ratio could help identify patterns in CPU utilization.

3. exec fork plus log: By summing exec and fork calls, which are both related to process creation, and then applying a logarithmic transformation, we can manage skewness and highlight relative changes in process management load that might influence CPU user-mode operation.

Reasoning:
1. rchar wchar ratio log: The ratio of characters read to characters written might indicate the workload's read/write intensity, affecting CPU user mode time. Taking the log stabilizes variance and transforms the distribution closer to normal, which could enhance prediction.

2. exec scall_sread_ratio multiply sqrt: The interaction between system exec calls and the ratio of total system calls to read calls could reflect how computationally intensive the operations are. Applying sqrt normalizes variance and reduces the impact of extreme values.

2025-10-15 17:50:21,456 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar wchar plus log, freemem scall divide, lread sread plus sqrt}

1. {rchar wchar plus log}: This feature continues to capture the combined effect of read and write operations at the character level, taking the logarithm to mitigate the effect of outliers and skewness in the data.

2. {freemem scall divide}: This feature examines the availability of memory relative to system calls, which may indicate the load on the system and the efficiency of memory usage, potentially affecting CPU usage in user mode.

3. {lread sread plus sqrt}: By adding lread and sread, we gain insight into the intensity of both memory reads and system reads combined. Taking the square root helps normalize the distribution and diminish the influence of higher values which may not be linearly translated to CPU usage in user mode.

These features are designed to provide additional nuanced predictors for CPU usage, capturing interactions and ratios that more directly relate the resource consumption to user mode activities.
