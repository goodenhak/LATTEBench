Industry Ethnicity cross label_encode, 
Age YearsEmployed plus sqrt, 
Income CreditScore multiply log
}

### Explanation:

1. Industry Ethnicity cross label_encode: This feature is created by taking a cross of the Industry and Ethnicity categorical features and then applying label encoding. This combination might capture interaction effects between a person's industry and their ethnic group, which could influence their credit card success rate.

2. Age YearsEmployed plus sqrt: This feature takes the sum of Age and YearsEmployed and then applies the square root. The combination of age and years employed may provide an indication of a person's stability and experience, influencing their creditworthiness. The square root transformation can help mitigate skew.

3. Income CreditScore multiply log: This feature multiplies Income and CreditScore and then takes the logarithm. Combining income with credit score might better represent financial reliability and ability to manage credit, which is crucial for credit card application success. The logarithm helps reduce the impact of high-income earners or those with very high credit scores.

2025-09-01 18:53:45,234 - INFO - LLM Output: {PriorDefault zscore CreditScore zscore multiply, Income Age divide log, Gender BankCustomer Employed cross}

### Explanation:

1. {PriorDefault zscore CreditScore zscore multiply}:
   - Purpose: Assess how much the history of defaults and current credit score deviate simultaneously from their respective distributions.
   - Rationale: Both prior defaults and credit score are highly indicative of creditworthiness. By normalizing these features using Z-scores and then multiplying, we focus on applicants who either strongly deviate positively or negatively from average behavior, potentially highlighting those whose credit score is better or worse than their history would suggest.

2. {Income Age divide log}:
   - Purpose: Evaluate income in relation to age on a logarithmic scale.
   - Rationale: Normalizing income by age, then applying a logarithm reduces the impact of extreme values and allows us to observe the proportionality of income concerning life stage or earning potential. Younger individuals with higher income or older individuals with lower income can be key in determining creditworthiness due to their unique placeholders in life’s earning curve.

3. {Gender BankCustomer Employed cross}:
   - Purpose: Explore the interaction between gender, bank customer status, and employment status.
   - Rationale: A person's employment status combined with bank affiliation might differ in impact by gender. Identifying cross patterns can highlight demographic tendencies or discrepancies in how these features influence credit card application success rates. Analyzing these intersections could provide insights into systematic biases or patterns within these groups.

2025-09-01 18:53:53,346 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the prediction model for successful credit card applications, we will create new features through feature engineering based on the provided dataset. The goal is to capture complex relationships or interactions that might be important for predicting the target variable. Here are three newly created features with their explanations:

1. Interaction between CreditScore and PriorDefault: The presence of a prior default and a credit score can greatly impact the success of credit card applications. By capturing the interaction, we can assess if the impact of a prior default diminishes with higher credit scores.
   
   RPN: CreditScore PriorDefault multiply

2. Age Adjustment based on Employment Status: Older individuals who are employed might have different credit dynamics compared to younger or unemployed individuals. We consider the product of Age and Employed to capture the effect.
   
   RPN: Age Employed multiply

3. Income to Debt Ratio: A higher income relative to debt usually indicates better financial health, which could be crucial for credit card applications. This feature can help assess the applicant's ability to manage debt.
   
   RPN: Income Debt divide

Final output:

2025-09-01 18:53:59,283 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the predictive power of the given dataset for the credit card application success task, we can employ feature engineering by generating three new features using reverse Polish notation. These features are crafted based on the relationships and transformations that might reveal underlying patterns related to the likelihood of a successful application. Here is the explanation and the corresponding RPN expressions:

1. Interaction between Employment and Debt: One possible insight is to evaluate how employment status might interact with debt levels. Employed individuals with certain levels of outstanding debt might show different tendencies regarding credit card applications. 
   - RPN: {Employed Debt multiply}

2. Income Stability Indicator: By creating a ratio between Income and Debt, we can derive a feature that shows an individual's income stability or capability to manage or service existing debt. Additionally, applying a logarithmic transformation can normalize the distribution and highlight differences in stability more prominently.
   - RPN: {Income Debt divide log}

3. Citizenship-based Aggregated Debt: Citizenship status might be a significant predictor of financial behavior or access to resources, affecting the credit card application success. Grouping debt by citizenship provides an average measure that highlights trends specific to different citizenship categories.
   - RPN: {Citizen Debt groupbythenmean}

These features have the potential to capture both interaction effects and normalized trends, which may improve the model's capacity to discern patterns that correlate with successful credit card applications.

2025-09-01 18:54:02,967 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, let's consider creating three new features that can capture interesting interactions or transformations in the data:

1. Interaction between Employed and YearsEmployed: The result will highlight the contribution of employment duration conditional on being employed. This feature can help identify a stable employment situation, which might increase the likelihood of credit card approval.

2. Interaction between Debt and Income_Debt_divide: This feature will provide insight into the debt standing relative to income. People with lower relative debt are likely less risky.

3. Convert Citizen feature into a numerical format and combine it with DriversLicense. This transformation allows us to assess the combined effect of citizenship status and having a driver's license, both of which might contribute positively to creditworthiness.

2025-09-01 18:54:07,325 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the predictions of successful credit card applications in the given dataset, let's generate three new features based on the provided operators and features:

### Feature 1: Influence of Employment and Industry on Income

Rationale: Employed individuals in certain industries might have a higher income and therefore could be more likely to succeed with credit card applications. We can combine the employment status with the industry and income information to capture this potential pattern.

RPN Expression: 
{Employed Industry cross Income multiply}

### Feature 2: Financial Stability Indicator

Rationale: Individuals with lower debt relative to their income might be considered financially stable and more likely to be successful in applying for a credit card. We will create a feature that considers the difference between income and debt.

RPN Expression:
{Income Debt subtract}

### Feature 3: Default Risk-Adjusted Credit Score

Rationale: Accounting for prior defaults when considering credit scores can provide a better understanding of risk. We will penalize the credit score with the prior default indicator to create an adjusted score that reflects the combined impact.

RPN Expression: 
{CreditScore_PriorDefault_multiply PriorDefault multiply}

Combining these strategies takes advantage of the given feature set, focusing on employment stability, financial health, and credit risk, potentially enhancing the model's ability to predict successful credit card applications.

2025-09-01 18:54:13,226 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the prediction of credit card application success, we need to create features that can provide the model with more insightful information about the individuals and their circumstances. Here's the reasoning and the RPN expressions for the new features:

### Feature 1: Employment Stability Score
Rationale: The stability of a person’s employment could be an important factor in their ability to obtain credit. This feature combines the number of years employed and employment status to give a score that reflects employment stability and potential financial reliability.

RPN Expression:
- YearsEmployed Employed multiply

### Feature 2: Financial Burden Indicator
Rationale: To understand the financial burden on an individual, we can consider the relationship between their debt and income. This feature will reflect potential financial distress situations and help assess credit risk.

RPN Expression:
- Debt Income divide

### Feature 3: Credit Risk Score
Rationale: This feature aims to capture the risk associated with prior defaults while considering the impact on credit score. Adjusting the credit score by penalizing it based on prior defaults provides a more nuanced risk assessment.

RPN Expression:
- CreditScore_PriorDefault_multiply PriorDefault multiply

Combining these new features with the existing dataset may provide better insight into the underlying patterns that determine credit card application success.

2025-09-01 18:54:18,997 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the prediction of credit card application success, let's create three new features based on the given data and operators. The aim is to capture different aspects related to financial stability, employment reliability, and risk management, which are important factors in credit risk assessment.

### Feature 1: Income Stability Score
Rationale: This feature captures an individual's employment situation relative to their industry, potentially highlighting stability and job security, which can be important for creditworthiness. We multiply employment status with income and the industry label to represent stability.

RPN Expression: 
{Employed Industry cross Income multiply}

### Feature 2: Financial Stability Indicator
Rationale: Individuals with lower debt relative to their income might be considered financially stable and more likely to be successful in applying for a credit card. We will create a feature that considers the difference between income and debt.

RPN Expression:
{Income Debt subtract}

### Feature 3: Default Risk-Adjusted Credit Score
Rationale: Accounting for prior defaults when considering credit scores can provide a better understanding of risk. We will penalize the credit score with the prior default indicator to create an adjusted score that reflects the combined impact.

RPN Expression:
{CreditScore_PriorDefault_multiply PriorDefault multiply}

These new features aim to enrich the dataset with measures of financial stability, income stability related to employment and industry, and an adjusted metric for credit risk considering past default history, which are potentially valuable for improving downstream model performance in predicting credit card application success.

2025-09-01 18:54:23,841 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the predictions of credit card application success, we can create new features that might have strong predictive power. Here's a proposal for three new features along with their explanation and RPN expressions:

### Feature 1: Employment Stability Score
Rationale: Longer employment in the same industry might indicate a more stable financial situation. We will create a feature that measures employment stability as the product of years employed, employment status, and the characteristic of the industry, assuming industry's nature might impact income stability.
- RPN Expression: {YearsEmployed Employed multiply Industry label_encode multiply}

### Feature 2: Socioeconomic Status Indicator
Rationale: Individuals with higher income relative to their zip code and debt might indicate a stronger socioeconomic status, potentially leading to better creditworthiness. This feature calculates income adjusted by zip code and debt.
- RPN Expression: {Income ZipCode divide Debt divide}

### Feature 3: Comprehensive Credit Score Adjustment
Rationale: Adjusting the credit score based on the individual's banking and driving license characteristics. This aims to capture personal responsibility, as a driving license might indicate stability and having a bank account suggests better financial management.
- RPN Expression: {CreditScore_PriorDefault_multiply DriversLicense multiply BankCustomer multiply}

Each of these features is designed to provide a more nuanced understanding of financial stability and personal characteristics that could impact credit card application success.

2025-09-01 18:54:29,930 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for credit card applications, let's generate three new features, keeping in mind the influence of existing features on credit card approval likelihood:

### Feature 1: Financial Flexibility
Rationale: Higher financial flexibility, where individuals have more income compared to debt, might indicate a higher capability to manage credit cards efficiently. We create a ratio feature between income and debt.
RPN Expression: {Income Debt divide}

### Feature 2: Employment Stability
Rationale: Longer tenure in a job might showcase reliability and stability in earning capacity, thus influencing credit card approval rates positively. To capture this, we will consider the years employed with a focus on the employment sector.
RPN Expression: {YearsEmployed Industry label_encode cross}

### Feature 3: Adjusted Financial Risk
Rationale: Incorporating adjusted financial risk by penalizing income with prior defaults provides an understanding of the risk associated with an individual. Higher prior defaults should lower income effectiveness in risk consideration.
RPN Expression: {Income PriorDefault multiply}

These engineered features aim to bolster the predictive model's understanding of financial behavior and risk management strategies in the context of credit card applications.
