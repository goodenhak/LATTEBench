PriorDefault Income multiply log,

}

Reasoning:
1. PriorDefault Income multiply log: This creates an interaction term between prior default status and income, then applies a log transform to handle the skewed income distribution. People with prior defaults and low income are likely higher risk, and the log helps normalize the multiplicative effect.

2. Age Debt multiply Income divide: This calculates the ratio of (Age * Debt) to Income, which represents the debt burden adjusted by age and income. Younger applicants with high debt relative to income may be riskier, and this feature captures that interaction.

3. Industry PriorDefault cross groupbythenmean: This performs target encoding by calculating the mean approval rate for each Industry-PriorDefault combination. This captures industry-specific risk patterns that may differ based on prior default history, providing a powerful categorical encoding.

PriorDefault Income multiply log,

Reasoning:
1. PriorDefault Income multiply log - This creates an interaction term between PriorDefault and Income, then applies log transformation to handle the extreme skewness seen in the PriorDefault_Income_multiply_log feature (which has a wide range from -13.8 to 10.8). This captures how income affects creditworthiness differently for those with vs without prior defaults.

2. Age_Debt_multiply Income divide - This creates a ratio feature that normalizes the Age*Debt interaction by Income, potentially capturing debt burden relative to earning capacity. The original Age_Debt_multiply_Income_divide shows extreme values (up to 773M), so this ratio might be more stable and interpretable.

3. Industry PriorDefault cross - This creates interaction terms between Industry and PriorDefault, capturing how the impact of prior defaults on credit card approval might vary across different industry sectors. This is particularly valuable since certain industries (like Financials) might view prior defaults differently than others.

Reasoning:
1. PriorDefault Income multiply log: This feature captures the interaction between prior default status and income, which are both critical factors in credit card approval. Taking the log helps handle the skewed distribution of income and makes the feature more normally distributed.

2. Age Debt multiply Income divide: This creates a ratio that represents debt burden relative to income and age. Younger applicants with high debt-to-income ratios may be riskier, while older applicants with similar ratios might be more stable.

3. Industry PriorDefault cross: This creates interaction terms between industry and prior default status, which could reveal that certain industries have different risk profiles even when applicants have similar default histories. For example, someone in Financials with a prior default might be treated differently than someone in Energy with the same default history.

These features were chosen because:
- They capture important interactions between key variables (default history, income, debt, age, industry)
- The logarithmic transformation helps normalize skewed distributions
- The cross feature enables the model to learn industry-specific patterns related to default history
- They provide both numerical transformations and categorical interactions that complement each other
- The features maintain interpretability while potentially improving predictive power
