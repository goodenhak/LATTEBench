2025-10-15 17:53:10,354 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar wchar ratio sqrt, scall sread swrite plus plus fork exec plus plus ratio, lread lwrite plus freemem divide} 

1. {rchar wchar ratio sqrt}: This feature captures the intensity of read-to-write operations with rchar and wchar, and then applies a square root transformation to alleviate skewness in the distribution. Both rchar and wchar involve characters transferred during read and write operations, and their ratio gives an idea of how balanced these operations are. The square root transformation is used to reduce outlier impact and possibly linearize relationships.

2. {scall sread swrite plus plus fork exec plus plus ratio}: This feature aggregates all system calls (scall), reads (sread), and writes (swrite), alongside fork and exec calls. The summing of these together gives a view of total system activity, and taking the ratio of the aggregated system calls (fork and exec) represents the intensity and diversity of different operations. This may be useful for capturing comprehensive system load from both read/write and exec-related operations.

3. {lread lwrite plus freemem divide}: This feature examines memory usage efficiency by calculating the sum of reads and writes (lread and lwrite), then dividing by freemem, the available memory pages. This gives insight into how much reading and writing is occurring relative to the available memory, potentially identifying scenarios where user mode time might be high due to substantial read/write operations coupled with low available memory.

2025-10-15 17:53:26,833 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar sread divide log, fork exec plus sqrt, freemem lread divide zscore}

Reasoning/Explanation:
1. rchar sread divide log: This feature examines the ratio of the number of characters transferred per second (rchar) to the number of system read calls per second (sread). By taking the logarithm of this ratio, we can explore the relationship between the efficiency of data transfer per read call. This can provide insights into the performance under heavier loads or low load scenarios.

2. fork exec plus sqrt: The fork and exec system calls indicate process creation and execution actions. Summing them gives an indication of process activity per second, while taking the square root can help normalize the feature and reduce variance when processes fluctuate heavily in a multi-user environment.

3. freemem lread divide zscore: The ratio between available memory pages (freemem) and memory reads (lread) could highlight memory pressure and its correlation with CPU user mode time. Applying z-score normalization can bring different scale features into a comparable range, ensuring better model performance during training.

2025-10-15 17:53:43,296 - INFO - LLM Output: {scall fork plus log, rchar wchar ratio, freemem abs sqrt}

1. {scall fork plus log}: The system call rate (scall) combined with fork calls per second (fork) can indicate the load on the CPU due to system operations. By summing these and applying a logarithm, we can potentially uncover non-linear relationships that correlate with CPU time in user mode.

2. {rchar wchar ratio}: The ratio of characters read (rchar) to characters written (wchar) can provide insights into the read-to-write activity balance. A high read-to-write ratio might reflect different system activity patterns which could be influential in predicting user mode time.

3. {freemem abs sqrt}: The available memory pages (freemem) can impact CPU performance. Applying absolute value and square root transformations can help normalize this feature and capture non-linear associations with the target, given its range and variance.

2025-10-15 17:54:02,944 - INFO - LLM Output: Given the features and operators, the goal is to derive new features that can improve prediction performance on the target (portion of time CPUs run in user mode). Upon examining the feature set, some new features can leverage possible interactions between memory reads/writes, system calls, and process queue size, among others:

### Reasoning:
1. Ratio of System Calls to Memory Transfers: 
   A higher ratio might indicate more CPU-bound processes rather than IO-bound, impacting user mode CPU time.
   
2. Interaction between free memory and system call frequency:
   When memory is low, system calls might be more frequent due to swapping/paging operations.
   
3. Queue Size and Execution Calls Product:
   Large run queues with high execution calls can indicate more processes being launched, potentially affecting user mode operation.

### RPN Outputs:
 
{scall lread lwrite plus divide, freemem scall multiply, runqsz exec multiply}


- Feature 1 (Ratio of System Calls to Memory Transfers): {scall lread lwrite plus divide} 
   - This feature calculates the ratio of system calls to the sum of memory reads and writes, assessing the balance between system calls and memory transfers.

- Feature 2 (Interaction between Memory and System Call Frequency): {freemem scall multiply}
   - Multiplies available memory pages with the number of system calls. This feature captures scenarios where high system call frequency exists with low available memory, possibly impacting CPU usage patterns.

- Feature 3 (Queue Size and Execution Calls Product): {runqsz exec multiply}
   - Multiplies the run queue size with execution calls. High values might correlate with increased CPU user time as more processes are managed concurrently.

These engineered features aim to capture important interactions within the system metrics, potentially affecting how CPU time is allocated in user mode.

1. lread lwrite plus exec multiply: This feature combines memory read and write operations and factors in the number of execution calls. It may capture scenarios where combined memory operations with multiple executions are indicative of user mode CPU utilization.

2. rchar sread divide log: By taking the log of the ratio of rchar to sread, this feature normalizes the variation in character transfers relative to read system calls, potentially indicating efficiency or bottlenecks in I/O operations impacting user mode operations.

3. freemem scall multiply sqrt: This feature considers the square root of the product of available memory and system calls, hypothesizing that there could be a nonlinear relationship influencing CPU time spent in user mode, given that available resources and operation demand might not scale linearly.

2025-10-15 17:54:53,580 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread swrite plus sqrt, exec fork multiply sqrt, rchar wchar plus scall ratio log}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. lread swrite plus sqrt: This new feature measures the combined effect of memory reads and writes along with a non-linear transformation with the square root. The idea is that the square root may help to normalize the skewness in the distribution of the summed 'reads' and 'writes', bringing out non-linear relationships that are not apparent previously.

2. exec fork multiply sqrt: This creates a feature that captures the interaction between 'exec' and 'fork' operations, and further applies a square root transformation. The combination of exec and fork calls is useful to account for process creation activities, which could be relevant for predicting CPU usage, and the square root can help with normalizing any nonlinear effects.

3. rchar wchar plus scall ratio log: Creates a feature by taking the ratio of total characters read/written ('rchar' + 'wchar') to system calls ('scall'), followed by a logarithmic transformation. This could highlight how efficiently system calls are utilized for data transfer, and the log transformation stabilizes the variance in the ratio, highlighting subtle multiplicative effects.

2025-10-15 17:55:19,299 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread lwrite plus scall divide log, exec fork plus sqrt, rchar wchar subtract abs}

1. Feature: {lread lwrite plus scall divide log}
   - *Reasoning*: This feature calculates the logarithm of the ratio of memory transfers (lread + lwrite) to the system calls (scall). Given the range of scall, this transformation could help smooth out the distribution and capture non-linear relationships.

2. Feature: {exec fork plus sqrt}
   - *Reasoning*: The square root transformation of the sum of exec and fork can reduce skewness and normalize these features, which often have heavy-tailed distributions due to infrequent but intense operations.

3. Feature: {rchar wchar subtract abs}
   - *Reasoning*: The absolute difference between rchar and wchar captures the disparity in character transfers, which could highlight shifts between read-intensive and write-intensive states that might correlate with CPU usage in user mode.

2025-10-15 17:55:40,912 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread swrite plus cosine, runqsz exec multiply sqrt, scall freemem divide tangent}

1. lread swrite plus cosine: This feature is created by adding the number of memory reads (lread) and system writes (swrite), then applying the cosine transformation. The combination of memory read and write activities may capture interactions between certain processes and applying cosine transformation can help in identifying periodic trends or changes in usage patterns.

2. runqsz exec multiply sqrt: This feature takes the square root of the product of the process run queue size (runqsz) and the number of system exec calls (exec). This can highlight relationships where a larger queue size is related to more frequent exec calls, which might indicate system load levels and user mode CPU usage.

3. scall freemem divide tangent: This feature calculates the tangent after dividing the number of system calls (scall) by the available memory for user processes (freemem). It can capture the fluctuations in how effectively system calls manage memory; applying tangent transformation might emphasize the turning points or critical levels of resource usage impacting user mode operations.

2025-10-15 17:56:15,835 - INFO - LLM Output: Given the task of predicting the CPU time spent in user mode using the available features, we aim to generate new features that could potentially enhance model performance. To do this, we consider relationships and transformations that might capture complex patterns or interactions between existing features. Below are three proposed feature engineering steps expressed in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), along with the rationale for each:

1. Interaction between memory operations and free resources:
   By creating a ratio of memory writes to free memory, we could measure how efficiently memory is being used in relation to available memory resources. High ratios might indicate memory pressure situations.
   - RPN: {lwrite freemem divide}

2. Non-linear transformation of read operations:
   Applying a non-linear transformation like the sigmoid function to the number of chars read might capture non-linear effects of character reads, which could be relevant if there are saturation effects or thresholds in the system behavior.
   - RPN: {rchar sigmoid}

3. Combined effect of high system calls with exec transformations:
   Our dataset indicates that exec calls often accompany system transformations. Computing the logarithm of the interaction between system calls and exec calls could highlight situations where exec operations significantly affect CPU usage, considering exec usually initiates new processes.
   - RPN: {scall exec multiply log}

These transformations are designed to explore interactions between memory and call operations, capture potential non-linear effects, and identify significant system transformations, which could all be crucial for better predictions in real-world system monitoring tasks.

1. {lread lwrite plus scall ratio log}: This feature computes the log of the ratio of system calls (scall) to the combined memory transfers (lread + lwrite). The intuition is that high system calls relative to memory transfers could indicate high CPU usage, and applying a log transformation can help normalize the skewness in the distribution.

2. {rchar wchar plus sread swrite plus ratio}: This feature calculates the ratio of the total number of characters transferred (rchar + wchar) to the total number of system read and write calls (sread + swrite). It captures how efficiently data is being read and written relative to the number of read/write operations, which could be a proxy for CPU data processing efficiency.

3. {scall exec plus lread lwrite plus ratio sqrt}: This feature takes the square root of the ratio of total system call operations (system calls + exec calls) to the memory transfer activities (lread + lwrite). The use of square root helps in reducing the variance and potential skewness in the distribution, while capturing the relationship between system operations and memory activities.
