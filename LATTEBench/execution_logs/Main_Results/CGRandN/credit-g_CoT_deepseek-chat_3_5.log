checking_status credit_amount cross, duration age subtract abs, credit_amount duration multiply log
}

Reasoning:
1. checking_status credit_amount cross: This creates a categorical interaction feature that combines checking account status with credit amount. This can capture non-linear relationships where the effect of credit amount on credit approval depends on the checking status. For example, a high credit amount might be riskier for someone with no checking account compared to someone with a substantial balance.

2. duration age subtract abs: This calculates the absolute difference between loan duration and applicant age. This can be useful as it captures the relationship between these two important numerical features. A large discrepancy might indicate higher risk (e.g., very short loan for an older person or very long loan for a young person).

3. credit_amount duration multiply log: This creates a combined financial burden feature (credit amount × duration) and applies a log transformation. The multiplication represents the total financial commitment, while the log transform helps handle the skewed distribution and makes the relationship more linear with the target variable.
