You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Professional-Salaried, Service_Worker, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Operative-Manufacturing, Salesman-Nonretail, Proprietor, Craftsmen-Other, Craftsman-Construction, Salesman-Retail, Manager, Laborer-Manufacturing, Clerk, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Farm_Laborer]

- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 427.4], Q1 = 0.5, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 11.9, Mean = 16.1128, Std = 38.9794

We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').
