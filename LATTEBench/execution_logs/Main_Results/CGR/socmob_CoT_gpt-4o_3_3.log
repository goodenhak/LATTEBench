You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- fathers_occupation: father's occupation (categorical), categories = [Proprietor, Farmer/Farm_Manager, Manager, Craftsman-Construction, Laborer-Manufacturing, Professional_Self-Employed, Operative-Manufacturing, Laborer-Nonmanufacturing, Craftsman-Manufacturing, Salesman-Retail, Operative-Nonmanufacturing, Farm_Laborer, Craftsmen-Other, Service_Worker, Salesman-Nonretail, Professional-Salaried, Clerk]

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.4, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 13.1, Mean = 18.3856, Std = 49.0412

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').

Features:
- counts_for_sons_first_occupation: counts for son's first occupation. The counts have been weighted to take account of the survey design, which is why they are not integers. (numerical), range = [0.0, 746.3], Q1 = 0.4, Median = 3.1, Q3 = 13.1, Mean = 18.3856, Std = 49.0412

- counts_for_sons_first_occupation_sigmoid:  (numerical), range = [0.5, 1.0], Q1 = 0.5986876601124521, Median = 0.956892745058914, Q3 = 0.9999979547735586, Mean = 0.8171, Std = 0.2122
- family_structure: family structure (categorical), categories = [intact, nonintact]
- race: race (categorical), categories = [white, black]

counts_for_sons_first_occupation is 89.0. sons_occupation is Laborer-Nonmanufacturing. counts_for_sons_first_occupation_sigmoid is 1.0. family_structure is intact. race is white.
