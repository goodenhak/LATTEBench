Age Debt multiply log CreditScore multiply, 
YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore multiply PriorDefault multiply Age multiply, 
Ethnicity label_encode Income multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt multiply log CreditScore multiply: This creates an interaction between age, debt, and credit score. The log transformation of (Age × Debt) helps normalize the product, and multiplying by CreditScore captures how creditworthiness interacts with age-debt burden. This could be more informative than the existing Age_Debt_multiply_log alone.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore multiply PriorDefault multiply Age multiply: This extends the existing powerful feature (YearsEmployed_Employed_multiply_CreditScore_multiply_PriorDefault_multiply) by incorporating Age, which adds information about life stage and financial maturity. Age multiplication may amplify the signal for creditworthiness assessment.

3. Ethnicity label_encode Income multiply: This creates an interaction between ethnicity (encoded numerically) and income. While Ethnicity_Income_groupbythenmean provides group averages, this direct multiplication preserves individual income information while still incorporating ethnicity effects, potentially capturing different income-creditworthiness relationships across ethnic groups.

}

Reasoning:
1. Age_Debt_multiply_log * CreditScore: This creates an interaction between the log-transformed age-debt product and credit score, which could capture non-linear relationships between these financial stability indicators and creditworthiness.

2. (YearsEmployed * Employed * CreditScore * PriorDefault) * Age: This amplifies the existing powerful feature (YearsEmployed_Employed_multiply_CreditScore_multiply_PriorDefault_multiply) by incorporating age, which may help differentiate between younger applicants with limited credit history and older applicants with established financial behavior.

3. Ethnicity (label encoded) * Income: This creates an interaction between ethnicity (converted to numerical) and income, which might reveal demographic patterns in income distribution that could affect credit card approval decisions while maintaining interpretability through multiplication rather than complex transformations.
