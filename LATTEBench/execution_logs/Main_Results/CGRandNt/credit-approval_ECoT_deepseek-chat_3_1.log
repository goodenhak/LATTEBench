Age Debt ratio log, 
YearsEmployed Employed cross, 
CreditScore Income ratio sigmoid
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: The ratio of Age to Debt could capture financial responsibility relative to life stage. Younger people with high debt might be riskier, while older people with low debt might be more stable. Taking the log helps normalize the distribution.

2. YearsEmployed Employed cross: This creates an interaction term between employment status and years employed. Someone who is currently employed with many years of experience is likely more stable than someone unemployed with many years (possibly indicating recent job loss).

3. CreditScore Income ratio sigmoid: This creates a risk profile combining creditworthiness and income. Higher values indicate good credit relative to income. The sigmoid function bounds the output to (0,1), making it suitable for probability-based models.

These features capture important interactions between financial stability (debt, income, credit score), employment history, and demographic factors that are highly relevant for credit card approval decisions.

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: Creates a risk-adjusted age feature by considering debt burden relative to age. Younger people with high debt may be riskier, while older people with low debt may be more creditworthy. The log transformation helps normalize the distribution.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: Creates an employment stability feature that combines both employment status and duration. This captures the compound effect of being employed AND having longer tenure, which is a strong positive signal for creditworthiness.

3. CreditScore Income multiply sigmoid: Creates a combined financial capacity feature that considers both credit history and income level. The multiplication amplifies the signal when both are favorable, and the sigmoid function normalizes the output to a 0-1 range suitable for classification models.

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: The ratio of Age to Debt could capture financial responsibility relative to life stage. Taking the log helps normalize the distribution and handle extreme values. Younger people with high debt might be riskier, while older people with manageable debt might be more creditworthy.

2. Income CreditScore subtract abs: The absolute difference between Income and CreditScore could identify inconsistencies in financial profiles. Large discrepancies might indicate higher risk (e.g., high income but poor credit score suggests financial mismanagement, or low income but good credit score might be suspicious).

3. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: This interaction term amplifies the signal for employment stability. Currently employed individuals with more years of experience are likely more stable and lower risk. The multiplication gives higher weight to those who are both employed and have longer tenure.

Age Debt ratio log, YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore multiply, Industry PriorDefault cross
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: Creates a log-scaled ratio of Age to Debt, which may capture life stage relative to debt burden. Older applicants with lower debt might be more creditworthy.

2. YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore multiply: Combines employment stability (years employed), current employment status, and credit score. Employed individuals with longer tenure and better credit scores should have higher approval chances.

3. Industry PriorDefault cross: Creates interaction between industry type and default history. Certain industries might have different risk profiles when combined with prior default status, which could be predictive of credit card approval success.

Age YearsEmployed plus log,

}

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed plus log: Combines age and employment duration, which are both important indicators of financial stability. The log transformation helps normalize the distribution and handle outliers.

2. Income Debt plus log: Creates a debt-to-income ratio proxy, which is a fundamental metric in credit scoring. The log transformation makes this feature more normally distributed and improves model performance.

3. Industry PriorDefault cross Employed cross: Creates a three-way interaction between industry, prior default status, and employment status. This captures complex relationships - certain industries may have different default patterns, and employment status combined with industry and default history could be highly predictive of credit card application success.

Age YearsEmployed multiply Debt divide log,

Industry PriorDefault cross Employed multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed multiply Debt divide log - This creates a feature that represents the log of (Age × YearsEmployed)/Debt. This captures the relationship between a person's age, employment duration, and their debt burden, which should be predictive of creditworthiness. The log transformation helps normalize the distribution.

2. Income Debt divide log - This creates the log of income-to-debt ratio, which is a classic financial health indicator. People with higher income relative to their debt are more likely to be approved for credit. The log transformation handles the skewed distribution.

3. Industry PriorDefault cross Employed multiply - This creates an interaction feature that combines industry, prior default status, and employment status. Different industries may have different default patterns, and being employed could mitigate the negative impact of prior defaults differently across industries.
