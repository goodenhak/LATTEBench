1. credit_amount duration divide: This feature calculates the ratio of the credit amount to the duration of the credit. This feature gives an idea of the monthly credit burden, which can be important to determine the creditworthiness of an applicant. A lower ratio could indicate a manageable credit, whereas a higher ratio might suggest higher risk.

2. checking_status savings_status cross: The combination of checking account status and savings status as a categorical feature can provide a more comprehensive view of the applicant's financial health. Different combinations might indicate varying degrees of financial stability. For example, having both a low checking status and no known savings could imply higher risk compared to someone with a stable checking account and substantial savings.

3. credit_amount installment_commitment divide: This feature computes the ratio of the credit amount to the percentage of disposable income committed to installments. This ratio helps evaluate how stretched a person's finances are as a result of this credit relative to their income. A higher value could signify financial stress, affecting the applicant's ability to repay the credit.

2025-09-21 23:53:13,599 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we will strategically create new features that leverage existing patterns and interactions within the dataset. The reasoning behind the chosen transformations is to explore potential synergies and interactions that may provide more predictive power.

For the given task:

1. Credit History Impact: We want to examine how credit history influences the amount of credit requested in relation to its duration. A higher credit ratio might indicate a higher risk or a particular credit management strategy.

2. Employment and Purpose Interaction: Understanding how someone's employment status affects their credit purpose could yield insights. For example, individuals with stable employment might seek larger credits for large purchases.

3. Property Magnitude and Housing Type: The relationship between property ownership and housing status could be a crucial factor in assessing creditworthiness. Owning a property might suggest financial stability, thus impacting credit predictions.

Here are the new features expressed in Reverse Polish Notation:

 
{credit_history credit_amount duration divide cross, employment label_encode purpose label_encode cross, property_magnitude housing cross}


Explanation:

1. credit_history credit_amount duration divide cross: 
   This feature leverages the interaction between credit history categories and the credit amount divided by duration. By cross-referencing these, we aim to capture any correlational signals between previous credit behaviors and the credit amount versus duration.

2. employment label_encode purpose label_encode cross:
   Employment status and the reason for credit might hold valuable interactions. By label encoding these categorical variables and taking their cross product, we can better understand how these categories interrelate, potentially signaling a strong pattern regarding the credit decision.

3. property_magnitude housing cross:
   By crossing property ownership status with housing type, we explore how owning assets might correlate with one's housing situation in relation to credit decisions. This can capture the nuanced relationship between property value and the credit risk associated with different housing types.

These features are crafted anticipating they might reveal hidden interdependencies within the data that aren't immediately apparent with the original individual features alone, thus providing the downstream model more informative signals for predictions.

2025-09-21 23:53:19,362 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that might improve the model's performance, it's important to consider both the interactions and transformations of existing features. Below are some transformations and interactions that could potentially enhance the model:

1. Feature Transformation on Employment Duration: Employment is likely to be an important factor for credit-worthiness, particularly the length of employment. Using an exponential transformation can highlight the importance of longer employment durations, as real-world credit evaluations often emphasize job stability. 

2. Cross-Interaction between Personal Status and Housing: Combining personal status with housing can provide insights into financial stability and obligations, which are critical in determining creditworthiness. For example, married individuals might have more stable finances, and owning a house could imply asset stability.

3. Groupbythen Transformation based on Job Type: The type of job usually indicates income and job stability, influencing creditworthiness. Therefore, grouping the credit amount by job type and calculating the mean could give a feature that represents typical credit behavior for different job categories.

Here is the corresponding Reverse Polish Notation:

plaintext
{employment numerical_feature 5 bin exp, personal_status housing cross, job credit_amount groupbythenmean}


Explanation:

1. Employment Transformation: employment numerical_feature 5 bin exp - This transformation first label encodes the categorical employment feature into a numerical one, bins it for reasonable categorical differentiation (in case of non-linear relationships), and takes the exponential, emphasizing the weight of longer employment duration on credit evaluation.

2. Personal Status and Housing Interaction: personal_status housing cross - Creating a cross-product between personal_status and housing gives insight into the combination of living situation with marital/live-in status, which could impact credit decisions.

3. Job and Credit Amount Mean: job credit_amount groupbythenmean - This feature calculates the average credit amount within each job category, helping to capture typical credit behaviors and patterns associated with different job types, potentially signaling income stability or risk characteristics.

1. Leverage the checking account status, duration, and savings status to create an interaction feature. This captures the dependency of checking status and savings status and their effect on credit duration.

2. Explore transformations on credit amount divided by the duration and payment commitments to examine their relationship together, using the mathematical exponential function to capture non-linear dynamics.

3. Use personal status to differentiate patterns of age distribution by creating age-based bins and group by personal status to see differences in mean age.

2025-09-21 23:53:28,654 - INFO - LLM Output: {credit_amount_duration_divide sqrt, credit_history life insurance equal credit_amount divide, age installation_commitment ratio} 

Explanation:

1. credit_amount_duration_divide sqrt:
   - Feature: credit_amount_duration_divide measures the ratio of the credit amount to the duration, which is already indicative of the credit burden per month.
   - Operation: Applying sqrt helps handle the skewness in the distribution and moderate the influence of very high values.

2. credit_history life insurance equal credit_amount divide:
   - Features: credit_history provides insights into the customer's past credit behavior and property_magnitude indicates the presence of life insurance. Combining them helps in understanding the security of credit based on historical data.
   - Operation: Check if the property includes 'life insurance' using equal, and then scale the credit_amount based on this; a safer profile (with life insurance) might handle credit amounts differently compared to others.

3. age installment_commitment ratio:
   - Features: age is a crucial factor affecting creditworthiness, while installment_commitment gauges how much income is committed to installments.
   - Operation: Calculating the ratio between age and installment_commitment can give insights into stability versus current financial commitment, providing nuanced understanding of potential repayment capacity.

These new features aim to further capture nuanced relationships and scaling to improve the prediction tasks.

2025-09-21 23:53:34,151 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that might improve the model's prediction accuracy, we'll leverage feature engineering operators with intelligent transformations on existing features. Here’s the reasoning and RPN expression:

### New Feature 1: Duration Influence

#### Reasoning:
The duration feature plays a significant role in credit-related decisions. By creating interactions with categorical features like credit_history, we can capture patterns related to how past credit performances influence the duration over time.

#### RPN:
- We convert credit_history into a numerical format and create a numeric transformation with the duration.
- Use multiply to combine duration with the number encoded credit history.
  
{duration credit_history label_encode multiply}

### New Feature 2: Income Commitment Influence

#### Reasoning:
The installment_commitment in relation to employment status and years can reveal how employment stability affects one's ability to commit income towards credit installments. Cross the categorical employment status with installment commitment to capture granular patterns.

#### RPN:
- Cross employment and installment_commitment to generate meaningful interactions.
  
{employment installment_commitment cross}

### New Feature 3: Credit Amount Relative to Age and Housing

#### Reasoning:
The credit_amount relative to age and housing arrangement can provide insights into borrowing patterns influenced by age and housing status. Combining credit_amount with an age-based segmentation and checking housing status may reveal such patterns.

#### RPN:
- Convert age into categorical bins and cross with housing for socio-demographic insights.
  
{age 5 bin housing cross}

Combining these transformations capitalizes on the relationships among behavioral, demographic, and temporal attributes, possibly enhancing the discriminative power of the downstream model.

2025-09-21 23:53:38,868 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that improve model performance, we need features that capture interactions and transformations that aren't addressed by the current top features. Let's consider the importance of existing features and potential transformations using operators provided.

1. Credit Amount with Purpose Interaction: Understanding how credit amounts correlate with the purpose could reveal trends in expenditure that differentiate those who receive credit.
   - RPN: credit_amount purpose label_encode ratio log
   - This feature normalizes the credit amount by purpose type and applies a logarithmic transformation to handle skewness.

2. Employment and Age Interaction: This can hint at financial stability and how it changes across different ages and employment durations, which is crucial for predicting creditworthiness.
   - RPN: employment label_encode age multiply plus 0.001 sqrt
   - Here, age is adjusted using employment status encoded numerically and transformed with a square root function for stabilization.

3. Savings Status and Property Magnitude Interaction: Examining the relation between savings status and property type can show financial viability based on tangible assets and liquidity.
   - RPN: savings_status property_magnitude cross label_encode subtract
   - The feature crosses savings and property categories, encodes them, and applies a subtraction operation to extract meaningful differences between assets and savings.

Thus, the generated features in Reverse Polish Notation are:

 
{credit_amount purpose label_encode ratio log, employment label_encode age multiply plus 0.001 sqrt, savings_status property_magnitude cross label_encode subtract} 


These transformations and interactions could capture relevant patterns and improve the model's ability to predict credit approval outcomes.

2025-09-21 23:53:43,483 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we can create the following new features:

1. A feature combining credit_amount and employment, expecting that the length of employment influences the credit amount decisions, potentially revealing richer credit behavior patterns in combination with the credit amount. We perform a bin operation on employment to convert it to numerical data, then multiplied with credit_amount:

Expression: {employment 3 bin credit_amount multiply}

2. We can further explore the relationship between age and credit_history. Older applicants may have different credit histories compared to younger ones. We convert credit_history to numerical using label encoding and create an interaction feature with age through multiplication:

Expression: {credit_history label_encode age multiply}

3. Lastly, using the personal_status combined with housing through the cross operation. This feature leverages two categorical features where the combination of personal status and housing situation might potentially indicate the socioeconomic status or reliability and stability of the applicant:

Expression: {personal_status housing cross}

These features aim to capture potential relationships between credit amount, employment length, age, credit history, personal status, and housing. This, hopefully, enriches the predictive power of the model by leveraging interactions and transformations beyond the simple scalar measures.

2025-09-21 23:53:47,718 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions, we will generate three new features using feature engineering techniques with the given operators and feature set. The rationale is to explore interactions between existing features and transformations that capture additional patterns in the data.

Feature 1: Interaction between duration and credit_amount to capture their combined effect on credit risk using division followed by a logarithm transformation.
- Rationale: By taking the log of the ratio of credit_amount to duration, we could capture non-linear relationships and stabilize variance.

Feature 2: Combination of credit_history and employment status to assess potential risk based on credit history and employment duration using a cross.
- Rationale: Employment status may influence how past credit behavior affects the chance of receiving a credit.

Feature 3: Interaction between installment_commitment and housing to evaluate how housing situation affects credit risk with regard to income allocation, using a cross.
- Rationale: Housing conditions may play a crucial role in financial commitments, potentially influencing credit approval.

These engineered features are intended to provide additional insights into the individual's financial profile and credit risk.

2025-09-21 23:53:52,597 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the predictions in the downstream model, I'll focus on creating features that combine existing features in a meaningful way or transform them to capture relationships that might not be obvious from individual features alone. 

1. Feature 1: One interesting aspect could be to explore the interaction between personal status and housing. How a person’s marital status might influence their housing situation can reveal socio-economic insights. For instance, those who are male single may prefer renting over owning a property compared to female div/dep/mar. Combining these may provide additional relational insight for credit risk assessment.
   
   RPN: {personal_status housing cross}

2. Feature 2: Combining existing savings and duration can reveal much about financial durability. People with more savings and longer durations may be less risky compared to those with less savings and shorter durations. So, considering a combined measure like savings status over duration (after encoding savings status) may highlight credit-worthiness insights.
   
   RPN: {savings_status label_encode duration divide}

3. Feature 3: Employment status and age can together indicate career maturity and stability which might influence credit approval. Older individuals with stable employment history might be seen as lower risk. Combining these features using interaction could present deeper insights.
   
   RPN: {employment age cross}

These new features aim to capture interactions and ratios that might provide valuable insights into credit approval patterns. By considering relationships between socio-economic indicators or factors affecting financial behavior, we can potentially enhance the model’s predictive performance.
