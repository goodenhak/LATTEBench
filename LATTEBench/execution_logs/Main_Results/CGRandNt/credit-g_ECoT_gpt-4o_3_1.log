2025-09-02 10:41:08,713 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that potentially improve the prediction of credit approval, we can exploit both categorical and numerical features using the operators mentioned. By creating interactions and transformations, we might capture information the original set of features doesn't explicitly show. Here are three new features:

1. Cross-interaction between employment and savings_status: This feature attempts to capture the relationship between employment status and savings, which could be indicative of financial stability or risk. For example, being unemployed with no savings might be a negative signal; conversely, employed with considerable savings might be positive.
   
   RPN: {employment savings_status cross}

2. Duration-adjusted credit amount: This feature calculates the credit amount per month, providing an idea of the loan repayment burden over time. It might indicate if the credit amount is proportionally high or low, given the duration. This could be crucial for assessing the applicant's ability to repay the credit.

   RPN: {credit_amount duration divide}

3. Age-related credit history: By grouping average duration by credit history, we can find an average duration per credit history type. Then the average is adjusted by the age of the applicant, potentially revealing age-related credit history patterns.

   RPN: {credit_history duration groupbythenmean age divide}

These engineered features leverage interactions and transformations to surface latent relationships and patterns that may improve the credit prediction model's performance.

Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):

2025-09-02 10:41:16,566 - INFO - Token Usage:{'prompt_tokens': 1775, 'completion_tokens': 311, 'total_tokens': 2086}
2025-09-02 10:41:16,566 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, let's analyze the available features and apply operations that would likely capture relationships or transformations useful for prediction:

1. Interaction between checking status and credit history: Understanding the interaction between a person's account status and their credit history can be useful. It might capture trends or groups that have distinct credit behaviors. We can use the cross operator to create this interaction feature.
   
   RPN expression:
   {checking_status credit_history cross}

2. Normalized credit amount: Since credit_amount has a wide range, normalizing it can help with learning patterns related to different scales of credit. A z-score normalization is appropriate here to bring the feature to a common scale which helps in comparison and understanding the relative position of an individual's credit amount within the overall population.
   
   RPN expression:
   {credit_amount zscore}

3. Employment duration feature: The employment feature affects creditworthiness, and capturing this in a numerical format could help in making better predictions. We will use label_encode to convert this categorical feature into a numerical one, reflecting the number of years employed, which can then better integrate into mathematical operations within the model.
   
   RPN expression:
   {employment label_encode}

Final output with these features:
{checking_status credit_history cross, credit_amount zscore, employment label_encode}

These feature transformations aim to capture interactions that may not be easily visible to a model while also ensuring numerical stability and the inclusion of important demographic information.

2025-09-02 10:41:21,838 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the predictive performance of the downstream model, we can focus on generating new features by combining different operators and existing features. Based on the given data and operators, here are three new features with their reasoning:

1. cross between categorical features: Combining categories from checking_status and savings_status can give insights into a person's liquidity situation, which is crucial for credit decisions. Both features indicate how financial resources are managed.

2. Feature scaling for numerical features: Creating a ratio of credit_amount to age can reveal the relative burden of credit compared to the applicant's life stage, providing valuable insight for eligibility.

3. Usage of a zscore transformation: Applying a z-score transformation on the employment_label_encode can standardize the employment duration feature and reveal how much of an outlier an applicant's employment status is compared to others, potentially influencing creditworthiness.

2025-09-02 10:41:57,906 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we aim to create new features that can capture useful interactions and transformations of the existing data while focusing on maximizing information gain about the credit decision task. Here are three new features created using Reverse Polish Notation, along with the reasoning behind them:

1. Purpose and Credit History Cross: Considering both the purpose of the credit and the credit history should capture crucial information about the borrower's intentions and reliability. Cross-product features often capture meaningful interactions between categories that can improve predictive accuracy.

2. Age and Installment Commitment Divide: This feature captures how the age of an applicant relates to their installment payment obligation. This could reflect the applicant's financial maturity and capacity to handle installments relative to their age.

3. Savings Status and Credit Amount Ratio: The ratio of current savings to the requested credit amount can provide insight into the borrower's financial buffer relative to their borrowing needs. This is often a crucial determinant in assessing creditworthiness.

Let's represent these transformations in Reverse Polish Notation:

plaintext
{purpose credit_history cross, age installment_commitment divide, savings_status label_encode credit_amount divide}


### Explanation:
- Purpose and Credit History Cross (purpose credit_history cross): We use a cross operation to combine the categorical features 'purpose' and 'credit_history'. This helps in evaluating how different credit histories impact the likelihood of loan approval for specific credit purposes.
  
- Age and Installment Commitment Divide (age installment_commitment divide): This numerical feature divides the age by the installment commitment rate. It can highlight applicants who might have higher or lower capacities for installment payments relative to their age.

- Savings Status and Credit Amount Ratio (savings_status label_encode credit_amount divide): First, 'savings_status' is converted from a categorical feature to a numerical one using a label_encode operation, then we take the ratio with the 'credit_amount'. This can reflect the relationship between the savings status and the amount of credit requested, which often indicates how stretched the borrower's financial resources might be.

2025-09-02 10:42:09,361 - INFO - LLM Output: When tasked with generating new features to improve the downstream task, one approach is to create features that capture complex interactions and transformations that the model might not easily learn on its own. Considering the provided data and operators, here are three potential new features, expressed in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), along with their rationale:

1. Combining Credit History and Property with Purpose to Capture Risk Profile:

   By crossing credit_history, property_magnitude, and purpose, we can create a feature that encapsulates a composite risk profile associated with these three aspects, which are crucial for credit risk assessment. This can potentially uncover patterns in creditworthiness that the individual features might not express.

   RPN: 
    
   {credit_history property_magnitude cross purpose cross}
   

2. Normalized Savings to Credit Ratio:

   Using savings_status, credit_amount, and creating a ratio that is then log-transformed can provide insight into financial health and credit demand. The log transformation helps to normalize the distribution, especially when there might be outliers or a skewed distribution in credit amounts.

   RPN: 
    
   {savings_status label_encode credit_amount divide log}
   

3. Age Interaction with Employment and Duration:

   By forming an interaction between age, employment_label_encode, and duration, this composite feature captures the potential stability of an applicant given their age and employment status over the duration of the credit. A multiplicative interaction ensures that significant differences are highlighted across these features.

   RPN: 
    
   {age employment_label_encode multiply duration multiply}
   

These new features aim to encapsulate complex interactions, normalize potentially skewed distributions, and highlight key differentiators in applicant profiles that could impact credit decisions.

2025-09-02 10:42:17,212 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we should focus on creating new features that capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between existing features. Below are three proposed new features with explanations:

1. Interaction between checking_status and savings_status:
   - Reasoning: Checking and savings account statuses are critical indicators of a person's financial liquidity and stability. By creating an interaction feature between them, we may uncover useful information about the applicant’s financial behavior.
   - RPN: {checking_status savings_status cross}

2. Ratio of credit_amount to existing_credits:
   - Reasoning: The ratio between the credit amount and the number of existing credits can provide insight into whether the applicant is taking a manageable credit amount proportionate to their existing commitments, which affects their creditworthiness.
   - RPN: {credit_amount existing_credits divide}

3. Age and employment interaction with risk level consideration:
   - Reasoning: Age and employment status can influence credit risk significantly. Combining these with consideration for age range may produce valuable insights into the applicant’s ability to repay the credit. 
   - RPN: {age employment_label_encode multiply, credit_history property_magnitude cross numeric label_encode cross with age maybe}

These features are designed to enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns and interactions in the data, improving prediction accuracy.

2025-09-02 10:42:31,472 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features and potentially improve the downstream model's performance, especially when predicting whether a person receives credit, we will consider existing features, operators, and insights based on the given scoring of existing features.

Let's utilize the top existing features and available operators to create three new features:

1. Feature 1: Combining Purpose and Savings Status with Credit History  
   The existing top features indicate that interactions between purpose and credit history, as well as between savings status and credit history, are valuable. Combining these features could capture more nuanced financial behavior patterns.

   RPN: {purpose savings_status credit_history cross}

2. Feature 2: Durational Influence on Credit Score Contextualized by Payment Plan  
   Duration can influence the understanding of a person's payment behavior. Cross-multiplying it with other payment plans (which can indicate economic behavior patterns) might offer new insights.

   RPN: {duration other_payment_plans label_encode multiply}

3. Feature 3: Financial Commitment Adjustment Over Age  
   Adjusting age by installment commitment and capturing this over time can provide insight into the evolution of financial responsibility with age. This type of feature might capture lifecycle financial transitions.

   RPN: {age installment_commitment divide cumsum}

These features aim to capture complex interactions and transformations that could enrich the model's predictive capabilities regarding creditworthiness. Here is the complete expression:

Output: {purpose savings_status credit_history cross, duration other_payment_plans label_encode multiply, age installment_commitment divide cumsum}

2025-09-02 10:42:39,895 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that might improve the performance of the downstream model, we need to select combinations of features and operators that can potentially capture additional patterns in the data. A good approach is to leverage interactions between existing features, especially those that have shown promise in the given data examples and scores. Here's the reasoning for choosing new features:

1. Leverage existing top-ranked feature interactions: We see that checking_status credit_history cross is the top new feature, indicating that interactions between these categorical features are potentially important. Hence, we'll use this principle to explore other combinations.

2. Consider non-linear transformations and feature interactions: By using mathematical transformations like square, sqrt, or log, we can capture non-linear relationships which aren't obvious in direct interactions.

3. Feature scaling with z-scores or minmax: These transformations help in standardizing features and may emphasize deviations from the norm, which could be informative in predictions.

4. Cross features involving key categorical and numerical features: This allows exploring interactions between different types of features, which has often shown to be effective.

With these principles, let's define three new feature transformations:

1. Combine age and duration with a non-linear transformation: Since both duration and age are important numerical features, applying a sqrt transformation to their interaction may reveal new patterns.
   - RPN: age duration multiply sqrt

2. Interaction between employment stability and savings status: Stability in employment might have intricate relationships with savings status that are not linear. Using a non-linear transformation like exp or log could bring out these effects.
   - RPN: employment_label_encode savings_status_label_encode multiply exp

3. Cross feature of property magnitude and purpose, followed by a transformation: This could capture how property ownership might influence the purpose of credit, further analyzed by zscore to highlight significant deviations.
   - RPN: property_magnitude purpose cross zscore

Therefore, the proposed new features in Reverse Polish Notation are:

plaintext
{age duration multiply sqrt, employment_label_encode savings_status_label_encode multiply exp, property_magnitude purpose cross zscore}
