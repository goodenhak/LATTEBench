2025-09-02 10:55:11,983 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three engineered features along with the reasoning:

1. avg_monthly_payment  
   • Reasoning: By dividing the total credit amount by its duration, we get the average monthly payment burden. Higher monthly burdens often correlate with higher default risk.  
   • RPN: credit_amount duration divide  

2. age_group_5bin  
   • Reasoning: Binning age into 5 groups can capture non‐linear age effects (e.g. very young vs. mid‐career vs. near‐retirement).  
   • RPN: age 5 bin  

3. checking_savings_interaction  
   • Reasoning: The combination of checking account status and savings status may interact—e.g. a customer with no checking but high savings differs from one with no checking and no savings.  
   • RPN: checking_status savings_status cross  

Final output in RPN set form:  
{credit_amount duration divide, age 5 bin, checking_status savings_status cross}

2025-09-02 10:56:50,593 - INFO - LLM Output: Here is the reasoning and the corresponding RPN expressions:

1. credit_amount duration square divide  
 – Captures how large the loan is relative to the square of its term, amplifying the effect of very short or very long durations.  
2. installment_commitment credit_amount_duration_divide multiply log  
 – Combines the borrower’s installment burden (% of income) with the per-month loan size, then log-scales to stabilize extremes.  
3. personal_status job cross target_encoding  
 – Segments borrowers by their combined demographics (marital/status + job) and encodes this grouping against the target for a strong predictive signal.

RPN output:
{credit_amount duration square divide, installment_commitment credit_amount_duration_divide multiply log, personal_status job cross target_encoding}
