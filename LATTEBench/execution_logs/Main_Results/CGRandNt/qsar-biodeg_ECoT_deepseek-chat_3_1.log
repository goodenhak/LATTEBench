Reasoning:
1. SpMax_L SpMax_B(m) subtract abs: The absolute difference between the two leading eigenvalues from different matrices (Laplace vs Burden weighted by mass) could capture important structural discrepancies that might be predictive of biodegradability. This creates a feature that measures the divergence between these two molecular graph representations.

2. nO nHDon plus nO_nHDon_plus subtract: This calculates the difference between the actual sum of oxygen and hydrogen donor atoms versus the pre-computed nO_nHDon_plus feature. This could reveal cases where the simple sum differs from whatever transformation was used to create nO_nHDon_plus, potentially capturing nuanced relationships between oxygen content and hydrogen bonding capability.

3. SdO nO divide: This creates a ratio of the sum of dO E-states to the number of oxygen atoms, representing the average electronic state contribution per oxygen atom. This could be more informative than either feature alone, as it normalizes the electronic state sum by the oxygen count, potentially revealing the electronic environment around oxygen atoms which is crucial for biodegradation processes.

Reasoning:
1. SpMax_L SpMax_B(m) subtract abs - The absolute difference between the two leading eigenvalues from different matrices (Laplace vs Burden weighted by mass) could capture important structural discrepancies that single features might miss. This creates a measure of spectral inconsistency that might be predictive.

2. nO nHDon plus nO_nHDon_plus subtract abs - This calculates the absolute difference between the actual sum (nO + nHDon) and the precomputed nO_nHDon_plus. This could identify cases where there's inconsistency in these oxygen/hydrogen bond donor relationships, which might indicate unusual molecular properties affecting biodegradability.

3. SdO nO divide log1p - This creates a normalized measure of oxygen E-state contribution per oxygen atom (with log transformation to handle zero values and normalize distribution). Compounds with unusually high or low E-state contributions per oxygen atom might have different biodegradation properties, as this could indicate electron density distribution patterns affecting reactivity.

These features focus on creating interaction terms, identifying inconsistencies between related features, and normalizing continuous variables - all strategies that often improve predictive performance in molecular descriptor datasets.

Reasoning:
1. SpMax_L SpMax_B(m) subtract abs: This creates a feature that captures the absolute difference between the two leading eigenvalue features from different matrices (Laplace vs Burden weighted by mass). Since both measure molecular complexity but from different perspectives, their difference might indicate specific structural patterns that affect biodegradability.

2. nO nHDon plus nO_nHDon_plus subtract abs: This calculates the absolute difference between the manually computed sum (nO + nHDon) and the existing feature nO_nHDon_plus. This could identify inconsistencies or special cases where the predefined sum doesn't match the actual atomic count sum, potentially revealing measurement errors or special molecular configurations.

3. nX nHM_plus nX_nHM_plus subtract abs: Similar to the previous feature, this captures the absolute difference between the manually computed sum (nX + nHM) and the existing feature nX_nHM_plus. This could help identify discrepancies that might be predictive of certain biodegradation behaviors.

These features focus on capturing discrepancies and differences between related molecular descriptors, which might reveal subtle patterns that individual features miss. The absolute value ensures we capture the magnitude of these differences regardless of direction.

nO nHDon plus nO_nHDon_plus subtract log abs, 
nX nHM plus nX_nHM_plus subtract log abs, 
nO nHDon plus nX nHM plus multiply log abs
}

Reasoning:
1. The top performing feature combinations involve interactions between oxygen/hydrogen donor atoms and halogen/heavy metal atoms, which are chemically meaningful for biodegradability prediction.

2. The second-best features involve differences between calculated and provided composite features (nO_nHDon_plus and nX_nHM_plus), suggesting that discrepancies between these values might be predictive.

3. I apply logarithmic transformation to handle potential non-linear relationships and capture multiplicative effects more effectively. The absolute value ensures we maintain directionality while handling any negative differences.

4. These features capture:
   - Discrepancies between calculated and provided atom group sums (potential data quality issues or meaningful variations)
   - Multiplicative interactions between different atom groups
   - Non-linear transformations that may better separate the classes

5. The logarithmic transformation is particularly appropriate for count-based features and ratios, as it can help normalize distributions and reveal underlying patterns that linear operations might miss.

These features build upon the most successful existing interactions while introducing non-linear transformations that could capture more complex relationships in the molecular descriptor data.

2025-09-02 11:39:39,210 - INFO - LLM Output: {SpMax_B(m) nO multiply log, nO nHDon plus nX_nHM_plus subtract abs, nO_nHDon_plus nX_nHM_plus multiply C% multiply}

Reasoning:
1. SpMax_B(m) nO multiply log: Combines molecular structure complexity (SpMax_B(m)) with oxygen content (nO), which are both important for biodegradability. The logarithmic transformation helps handle potential multiplicative effects and non-linear relationships.

2. nO nHDon plus nX_nHM_plus subtract abs: Creates an interaction feature that captures the balance between oxygen/hydrogen bond donors (biodegradation facilitators) and halogen/heavy metal content (biodegradation inhibitors). The absolute value ensures we capture the magnitude of this imbalance.

3. nO_nHDon_plus nX_nHM_plus multiply C% multiply: Multiplies three key factors: oxygen/hydrogen bond capacity, halogen/heavy metal presence, and carbon percentage. This creates a comprehensive feature that captures complex interactions between these important molecular properties that influence biodegradability.

These features were designed to:
- Capture non-linear relationships through logarithmic and multiplicative operations
- Create interaction terms between complementary molecular properties
- Maintain interpretability while enhancing predictive power
- Focus on the most chemically relevant features for biodegradability prediction (oxygen content, halogen presence, molecular structure)
