Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin

2025-09-02 12:36:50,763 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposals with their RPN formulas:

1. Income sqrt  
   – The raw income feature is extremely skewed (many zeros and a long tail). Taking the square‐root makes the distribution more Gaussian‐like, which often helps linear and tree‐based models.  
2. Age square  
   – Credit approval probability may have a non‐linear relationship with age (e.g. very young and very old applicants behave differently). Squaring age lets the model pick up that curvature.  
3. Industry × Ethnicity (label‐encoded)  
   – Different ethnic groups working in different industries may face distinct approval patterns. Crossing these two categoricals and label‐encoding creates a compact interaction feature.

Final RPN output:

{Income sqrt, Age square, Industry Ethnicity cross label_encode}

1. Log-scaled interaction of Income and CreditScore  
   - Rationale: captures the joint effect of earning power and creditworthiness, while log-transforming to reduce skew and heavy tails.  
2. Discretized Age into 5 bins  
   - Rationale: allows the model to learn non-linear age effects (e.g. very young vs. mature applicants).  
3. Industry target encoding  
   - Rationale: injects the industry-specific acceptance rate directly as a feature, capturing group-level success patterns.

2. “Log-scaled debt-to-income ratio”

2025-09-02 12:38:54,429 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new feature ideas:

1. Apply a log‐transform to the Debt_Income_ratio to tame its extreme skew and stabilize variance:  
   new_feature1 = log(Debt_Income_ratio + 1)

2. Capture the interplay between credit score and debt load by forming a ratio of CreditScore to (Debt + 1), highlighting creditworthiness relative to current obligations:  
   new_feature2 = CreditScore / (Debt + 1)

3. Normalize each person’s income by the average income in their industry to expose relative earning power within the sector:  
   new_feature3 = Income / (Industry mean Income)

RPN expressions for these three features:

1. Debt_Income_ratio is extremely skewed – taking log(Debt_Income_ratio + 1) will help stabilize variance.  
2. Income by Age (Income / Age) captures a normalized earning rate per year of life.  
3. Average prior-default rate within each ethnicity (Ethnicity grouped on PriorDefault) may highlight cultural or systemic risk patterns.
