2025-10-15 16:55:36,532 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread lwrite plus sqrt, scall exec multiply log, rchar wchar ratio log}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. lread lwrite plus sqrt: This feature captures the interactions of memory transfers between system memory and user memory. By summing 'lread' and 'lwrite', we get a sense of the overall memory operations happening per second. Applying the square root transformation can stabilize the variance and make the feature more normally distributed, which may lead to improved predictive performance for some models.

2. scall exec multiply log: 'scall' (system calls per second) and 'exec' (number of system exec calls per second) both indicate the intensity of system operations. Multiplying these gives a composite measure of activity intensity. Applying a log transformation can help in reducing skewness and highlighting relative differences in larger values.

3. rchar wchar ratio log: The ratio of 'rchar' (characters read per second) to 'wchar' (characters written per second) provides insight into the balance between reading and writing processes. Logging this ratio can help in managing disparity between smaller and larger values, improving the feature's utility for predictive modeling.

2025-10-15 16:55:49,198 - INFO - LLM Output: {freemem rchar divide, runqsz freemem subtract abs, scall exec divide log}

1. freemem rchar divide: This feature calculates the memory efficiency by dividing available free memory pages (freemem) by the number of characters transferred per second in system read calls (rchar). If the CPU utilization is high, tasks are likely more CPU-bound, which can impact the free memory available relative to data read/writes. This feature could help differentiate cases where the CPU is utilized heavily by tasks requiring large data reads.

2. runqsz freemem subtract abs: This feature looks at the absolute difference between the process run queue size (runqsz) and available memory (freemem). A larger queue size with less free memory might indicate higher CPU user mode usage due to resource constraints.

3. scall exec divide log: This calculates the log of the ratio of system calls (scall) to exec calls (exec). A high number of system calls relative to exec calls might suggest system-level processes are dominating CPU time, affecting user mode time. The log transformation helps to manage skewness in the data distribution.

2025-10-15 16:56:03,696 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread lwrite plus rchar wchar plus ratio, scall freemem divide lread lwrite plus log multiply, fork exec subtract abs freemem lread multiply ratio}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. {lread lwrite plus rchar wchar plus ratio}: The first feature creates a ratio between the sum of memory reads and writes (lread + lwrite) to the sum of character transfers during system read and write calls (rchar + wchar). This can help in understanding the efficiency of memory operations relative to character transfers, potentially a useful indicator for CPU usage patterns.

2. {scall freemem divide lread lwrite plus log multiply}: This feature looks at the behavior of system calls (scall) relative to available free memory (freemem), and multiplies it with the logarithm of the sum of lread and lwrite. This can capture the interaction between system memory operations and available resources, providing an indicator on how resource usage impacts CPU operations.

3. {fork exec subtract abs freemem lread multiply ratio}: Here, the difference between fork and exec is taken, and the absolute value is used to primarily reflect process creation activities, then it is divided by the multiplication of freemem and lread. It could provide an insight into how these CPU-bound activities vary with available memory and memory read operations.

These engineered features attempt to capture interactions that may be indicative of CPU user mode activity, improving predictive accuracy by providing new perspectives on resource usage and process management on the system.

2025-10-15 16:56:17,942 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar wchar plus equal 5 bin, lread scall plus rchar divide, runqsz freemem plus freemem divide log}

1. RPN: {rchar wchar plus equal 5 bin}
   - Explanation: Combining rchar and wchar, which are both related to data transfer, could identify patterns for CPU usage in user mode. The use of equal followed by a bin operation creates a categorical feature indicating specific interactions between read and write operations, then reduced into 5 discrete bins.

2. RPN: {lread scall plus rchar divide}
   - Explanation: The operation uses lread and scall, both indicating different types of system activity, then sums them. Dividing by rchar (the number of characters transferred per second by system read calls) normalizes the summed feature by the volume of data processed, allowing insights into efficiency or strain per character read.

3. RPN: {runqsz freemem plus freemem divide log}
   - Explanation: Summing runqsz (process run queue size) with freemem indicates correlation between queued processes and available memory. The sum is then normalized by freemem and transformed with a logarithm, providing a scale-independent measure of process intensity relative to available memory.

These features aim at improving the model's performance by leveraging interactions between memory usage, process queues, and data transfer that may influence CPU user mode operations.

2025-10-15 16:56:30,512 - INFO - LLM Output: {scall sread ratio log, runqsz freemem ratio sqrt, exec scall ratio abs}

Here is the reasoning behind the choice of new features:

1. scall sread ratio log: The system calls and system reads are likely indicative of system activity. By taking the ratio of system calls to system reads, we get a sense of how much reading happens per call. Applying the logarithm can help in normalizing and reducing skewness in the data.

2. runqsz freemem ratio sqrt: The ratio of the process run queue size (runqsz) to available memory pages (freemem) gives an indication of how loaded the system is in terms of processes waiting for memory. Applying the square root transformation can help stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed.

3. exec scall ratio abs: The number of exec calls compared to system calls can be a significant metric as it gives insight into how intensive the computational activity is. Taking the absolute value ensures the feature is non-negative, which might be beneficial if there are any negative or unusual values. 

These transformations aim to improve predictive performance by capturing relevant interactions and distributions within the data that aren't directly apparent from the raw features.

2025-10-15 16:56:44,890 - INFO - LLM Output: {scall sread subtract log, rchar wchar plus sqrt, exec freemem divide exp}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. scall sread subtract log: By calculating the difference between the total number of system calls (scall) and system read calls (sread), we get an indication of non-read system calls per second, capturing potential write or other operations. Applying a logarithm further normalizes the range and can help in emphasizing differences when system activities are low (as logarithm has a greater differential impact on smaller numbers).

2. rchar wchar plus sqrt: Summing rchar and wchar represents the total character transfers for both read and write operations per second. Taking the square root helps normalize this combined value and manage skewness, making the distribution more symmetric, which is often beneficial for linear models.

3. exec freemem divide exp: Dividing the number of exec calls (exec) by the available free memory pages (freemem) gives an idea of how intensive execution calls are relative to memory availability, which can indicate user-mode CPU usage. Applying the exponential function can help highlight scenarios where execution relative to memory is particularly high, emphasizing these scenarios more strongly in the model.

2025-10-15 16:56:59,034 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread freemem divide log, rchar scall divide sqrt, exec fork multiply log}

Explanation:

1. lread freemem divide log: 
   - Dividing lread by freemem gives an indication of memory usage efficiency related to logical reads, especially in high-memory conditions.
   - Taking the logarithm can help in normalizing what might be a skewed distribution due to infrequent but high lread scenarios.

2. rchar scall divide sqrt:
   - This feature measures how many characters are read per system call by dividing rchar by scall.
   - Using the square root stabilizes the variance of this ratio, potentially handling extreme values.

3. exec fork multiply log:
   - By multiplying exec and fork, we get a feature that might represent joint process creation and execution dynamics, which may vary depending on user degree of multi-tasking.
   - Taking the log in the end helps to tackle the skewness that can arise from the multiplication of two potentially larger values. 

These features are aimed to capture interactions between different resource utilizations and process management statistics in a non-linear way, which might enhance the model's understanding of system behavior during different CPU loads.

2025-10-15 16:57:13,236 - INFO - LLM Output: {runqsz freemem plus log, lread swrite multiply sqrt, rchar wchar divide exp}

### Explanation:

1. {runqsz freemem plus log}:
   - Reasoning: runqsz and freemem are indicators of system load and available resources, respectively. Their sum gives a combined view of CPU load and memory availability. Taking the logarithm helps in normalizing skewed data, potentially uncovering non-linear patterns that could be useful in predicting CPU user mode.

2. {lread swrite multiply sqrt}: 
   - Reasoning: lread (memory reads) and swrite (system writes) provide insight into memory and I/O activities. Multiplying them shines a light on systems doing intensive memory and write operations, while the square root normalizes the product. This feature could enhance predictive performance by capturing memory-write interaction effects.

3. {rchar wchar divide exp}:
   - Reasoning: rchar (read characters) and wchar (write characters) give measures of data transfer. Their ratio indicates read/write imbalance, and taking the exponential of this ratio could highlight significant discrepancies between data inputs and outputs, adding granularity to the prediction model.

2025-10-15 16:57:39,222 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread freemem divide square, scall sread subtract abs, exec fork ratio log}

Explanation:

1. lread freemem divide square:
   - Dividing lread by freemem gives a sense of how memory usage relates to logical reads. Squaring this value will highlight significant discrepancies, which might indicate intense memory or I/O operations influencing CPU user mode time.

2. scall sread subtract abs:
   - The subtraction of sread from scall gives the number of system calls that aren't read operations. Taking the absolute value will capture the magnitude of difference, which might correlate with CPU usage patterns in user mode (e.g., a large number of non-read system calls could indicate different types of processing or resource use).

3. exec fork ratio log:
   - Taking the ratio of exec to fork gives an idea about the relative occurrence of these two operations. Applying a logarithm to the ratio can help normalize the data, making it more suitable for models that assume normality or need transformations of skewed distributions. Additionally, the exec/fork operations are closely tied to process management, which is directly related to CPU time allocations.

Explanation:

1. exec freemem divide exp log: The exec freemem divide exp feature has a high influence in the previously engineered features, and it exhibited non-linear behavior suitable for an exponential transformation. Here, further applying a logarithmic transformation might provide additional insights by transforming the exponential feature to a more linear scale, potentially helping a linear model or a non-linear one to capture relationships better.

2. rchar wchar plus sqrt reciprocal: The existing feature rchar wchar plus sqrt demonstrates interactions between read and write operations through a square root transformation. By applying a reciprocal transformation, the focus is shifted to high rchar and wchar activity, which might capture inverse relationships or non-linear interactions that the model can exploit.

3. sread exec multiply log: The multiplication of sread and exec emphasizes scenarios where simultaneous read and execution operations occur. Taking a logarithm of this feature can normalize skewness and provide a better distribution for models to work with, essentially translating multiplicative relationships into additive ones for effective linear interpretation by models.
