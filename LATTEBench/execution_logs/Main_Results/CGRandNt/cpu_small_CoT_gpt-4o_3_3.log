2025-10-15 15:00:00,520 - INFO - LLM Output: {scall lread plus log, freemem freemem zscore exec multiply, swrite rchar ratio sqrt}

Explanation:
1. {scall lread plus log}: The intuition behind this feature is to combine the number of system calls (scall) and the reads per second (lread) since both relate to CPU activity, and then apply a log transformation to reduce skewness and stabilize variance. This might help capture interactions related to CPU-bound tasks.

2. {freemem freemem zscore exec multiply}: Using the z-score normalization for freemem, which will standardize this feature to illustrate its deviation relative to other observations. This standardized memory availability is then combined multiplicatively with the exec (the number of system exec calls), which can highlight how memory usage correlates with exec activity. It might be helpful to reflect the impact of exec calls relative to available memory on the CPU’s time in user mode.

3. {swrite rchar ratio sqrt}: Here, a ratio of swrite (system write calls) to rchar (number of characters read by system calls) can give insights into the read-write operations. Applying a square root transformation can help to normalize the feature distribution and allows modulating extreme outputs that might result from the ratio operation. This feature is potentially useful to represent the balance between read and write operations affecting CPU usage.

2025-10-15 15:00:15,054 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread lwrite plus sqrt, scall sread swrite plus plus log, rchar wchar plus freemem divide}

1. {lread lwrite plus sqrt} - This feature takes the sum of lread and lwrite which represents the total number of memory transfers per second between system and user memory, and then applies the square root. The intuition is that higher memory activity (both reads and writes) could correlate with CPU user mode time due to increased user processes causing more memory transfers.

2. {scall sread swrite plus plus log} - This feature calculates the logarithm of the sum of scall, sread, and swrite. Since these features represent different types of system calls, combining them and taking the log helps to dampen the variability and could highlight situations where increased call activity relates to increased CPU usage in user mode.

3. {rchar wchar plus freemem divide} - This feature computes the ratio of the sum of characters transferred by read and write system calls (rchar and wchar) to freemem. The hypothesis is that higher data transfer combined with lower available memory could indicate more intensive CPU usage for user processes, as processes are likely consuming more resources.

These features aim to capture relationships between existing data attributes that could affect CPU performance in user mode, enabling improvements in prediction accuracy.

2025-10-15 15:00:28,503 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread scall plus sqrt, runqsz freemem divide log, rchar wchar ratio zscore}

Explanation:

1. {lread scall plus sqrt}: This feature represents the square root of the sum of memory read operations between system and user space (lread) and the number of system calls (scall). High values might indicate frequent interactions with memory and system calls, suggesting more CPU engagement in user processes.

2. {runqsz freemem divide log}: This feature calculates the logarithm of the ratio of the process run queue size (runqsz) to the number of memory pages available (freemem). This ratio can provide insights into how the CPU load relates to available memory, potentially affecting CPU time in user mode.

3. {rchar wchar ratio zscore}: This feature captures the z-score of the ratio of characters transferred by system read calls (rchar) to those transferred by system write calls (wchar). The ratio gives an idea of the workload related to data transfer operations, which might correlate with CPU user mode activity.

These features are designed to capture complex interactions and distributions among the original features, potentially revealing underlying patterns affecting CPU usage in user mode.

2025-10-15 15:00:41,686 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread sread plus sqrt, fork exec plus square, rchar wchar ratio abs}

1. Feature 1: lread sread plus sqrt 
   - Reasoning: The sum of lread and sread encapsulates system memory reads more broadly. Applying the square root scales the feature down, which can help in stabilizing variance and emphasizing incremental changes.

2. Feature 2: fork exec plus square
   - Reasoning: Both fork and exec are indicators of process creation and execution. Summing them provides an aggregated view of these operations followed by squaring to exaggerate the effect of high activity concerning process changes.

3. Feature 3: rchar wchar ratio abs 
   - Reasoning: The ratio of rchar to wchar might already be sensitive to changes in read versus write operations. Taking the absolute value eliminates the effect of negative influences and yields a magnitude-focused feature useful in determining potential CPU utilization in user mode given input-output operations. 

These features are intended to capture a broader scope of memory operations, process activities, and input-output dynamics as they pertain to CPU utilization prediction.

1. lwrite scall plus log: This feature takes the sum of memory write operations between system and user space (lwrite) and the number of system calls (scall), and applies a logarithmic transformation. This can help in smoothing out large variations and achieving linearity, which is often beneficial for predictive modeling.

2. exec runqsz multiply sqrt: This feature captures the interaction between the number of system exec calls (exec) and the process run queue size (runqsz). Taking the square root of this product can help in scaling the feature, which may help in capturing non-linear relationships related to the execution load and queue size efficiently.

3. fork exec ratio zscore: By computing the ratio of the number of system fork calls (fork) to the number of system exec calls (exec), we get an idea of the relative frequency of these calls. Applying a z-score transformation to this ratio standardizes this feature to have zero mean and unit variance, making it more comparable across instances.

These newly engineered features aim to capture interactions and transformations that could reveal underlying patterns in the data and potentially improve the model's predictive capability concerning CPU user mode time.

1. lread lwrite plus sqrt: This feature represents the square root of the sum of memory reads and writes between system and user space. The idea is to capture memory interchange activity in a new way, which might correlate with CPU's user mode time when higher memory operations lead to increased CPU usage.

2. rchar wchar plus reciprocal: This feature calculates the reciprocal of the sum of characters transferred in system read and write calls. It focuses on character throughput, which might indirectly influence CPU utilization due to the processing required for handling significant data transfer in read/write operations.

3. exec fork multiply log: This one focuses on the number of system exec and fork calls, which are directly related to process creation and execution. Taking the product and then applying a logarithmic transformation could highlight their combined effect on system CPU usage. High values might correlate with increased CPU usage due to increased process management overhead. 

These transformations are designed to reveal nonlinear relationships and interactions by combining and transforming existing features, potentially leading to improved predictive performance.

2025-10-15 15:01:27,954 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread sread plus sqrt, scall freemem plus divide, runqsz freemem multiply}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. lread sread plus sqrt: The lread and sread features both deal with read operations. By adding these two and then taking the square root, this feature can capture the overall read activity in the system and its variability. The square root transformation helps in normalizing the distribution, especially since both lread and sread have a wide range. 

2. scall freemem plus divide: The scall feature represents the system calls and freemem is the available memory. Dividing system call activity by the available memory can provide an insight into the system's efficiency and resource utilization. This derived feature might help capture the balance between CPU-bound tasks and memory availability.

3. runqsz freemem multiply: By multiplying runqsz (indicating the run queue size) with freemem (available user memory), this feature could provide insights into the system's load balancing and efficiency. A large run queue but low available memory might indicate a CPU-bound bottleneck, and vice versa.

These transformations aim to capture interactions and nonlinear patterns between the existing features that could be critical for improving the downstream model's predictions.

2025-10-15 15:01:42,749 - INFO - LLM Output: {x lread sqrt, freeswap runqsz divide log, sread swrite plus sqrt}

Here is the reasoning behind the chosen features:

1. {x lread sqrt}: Applying a square root transformation can reduce the effect of extreme values, handling a situation where lread distribution has a high range and standard deviation. Coupled with the feature importance concept, the idea is to understand how lread influences CPU user mode time with reduced variance.

2. {freeswap runqsz divide log}: Taking the division of freeswap by runqsz provides the potential overhead of available swapping space against the run queue size and taking the logarithm further tames the variability. This feature might capture resource contention that impacts CPU user mode time.

3. {sread swrite plus sqrt}: Combining sread and swrite represents the total system-level I/O operation burden, while taking the square root aids in normalizing its spread of values, potentially improving model accuracy by capturing essential variance in user CPU time.

2025-10-15 15:01:56,975 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread scall plus multiply, rchar wchar ratio cosine, runqsz freemem ratio log}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. lread scall plus multiply: This feature calculates the product of lread and scall. This could capture complex interactions between memory transfers and system calls which might not be captured individually. A multiplicative interaction may highlight periods of high activity that could influence CPU user mode time.

2. rchar wchar ratio cosine: By taking the ratio of rchar and wchar and then applying the cosine function, we can capture patterns or periodic nature in the data transfer operations. This could identify distinctive patterns of data transfer intensive tasks that might influence user CPU usage.

3. runqsz freemem ratio log: The ratio of runqsz to freemem shows the relation between processes waiting for CPU and available memory, which is then processed by a logarithmic function. This helps in smoothing the data and reducing the impact of extreme values while capturing the load on the system, which can be indicative of CPU usage patterns.

2025-10-15 15:02:15,019 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread lwrite plus sqrt, rchar wchar plus log, scall fork plus multiply}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. lread lwrite plus sqrt: This feature takes the sum of memory reads (lread) and writes (lwrite) and computes the square root. High combined read/write operations with substantial values might indicate intensive user interaction with memory, which could correlate with user-mode CPU utilization.

2. rchar wchar plus log: Summing the number of characters read (rchar) and written (wchar) per second and then applying log transformation can provide a normalized scale of data transfer rates. This feature might capture scenarios where increased data throughput correlates with increased CPU time in user mode.

3. scall fork plus multiply: This feature captures the interaction between the number of system calls (scall) and fork operations (fork). Forking processes often lead to additional system calls in CPU-bound processes, which could impact the CPU time spent in user mode. Using multiplication helps emphasize scenarios with a high degree of both system calls and process forking, which might be indicative of CPU-intensive operations.
