2025-09-21 23:47:07,733 - INFO - LLM Output: {
checking_status credit_amount cross duration multiply credit_amount divide, 
credit_amount duration subtract age multiply sigmoid, 
savings_status credit_amount cross employment cross
}

Reasoning:
1. checking_status credit_amount cross duration multiply credit_amount divide: This creates an interaction feature that combines the checking status and credit amount (already shown useful as cross), then multiplies by duration and divides by credit amount again to create a ratio that captures the relationship between checking status, duration, and credit amount - potentially revealing risk patterns.

2. credit_amount duration subtract age multiply sigmoid: This calculates the difference between credit amount and duration, multiplies by age to weight by life stage, then applies sigmoid to normalize the output. This could capture whether the credit amount is appropriate for the applicant's age and loan duration.

3. savings_status credit_amount cross employment cross: This creates a triple interaction between savings status, credit amount, and employment status. Since all three are important financial stability indicators, their combination might reveal subtle patterns about creditworthiness that individual features miss. The double cross operation creates a high-dimensional interaction feature that could capture complex relationships.

Reasoning:
1. checking_status and credit_history are both important categorical features. Cross product can capture interactions between account status and credit history quality, which may reveal risk patterns not visible individually.

2. credit_amount * duration / age creates a ratio that represents the burden of the loan relative to the applicant's age. Younger applicants with large, long-term loans might be riskier, while older applicants might handle them better.

3. savings_status groupbythenmean of credit_amount reveals the typical loan size for each savings category. Applicants requesting amounts significantly different from their savings group's average might indicate unusual financial behavior worth flagging.

These features combine meaningful financial ratios with categorical interactions and group statistics that should help the model better distinguish between creditworthy and risky applicants.

checking_status credit_amount cross duration multiply, 
credit_history purpose cross, 
age credit_amount multiply duration divide
}

Reasoning:
1. checking_status credit_amount cross duration multiply: This combines the interaction between checking status and credit amount (already shown useful) with duration, which is a strong predictor. Multiplying by duration captures how both credit amount and checking status interact with loan term.

2. credit_history purpose cross: Creates interaction between two important categorical features - credit history and loan purpose. This can reveal patterns like certain purposes being riskier with specific credit histories.

3. age credit_amount multiply duration divide: Similar to the existing age*duration/credit_amount but with the multiplication and division order swapped. This creates a feature representing age-weighted credit amount per month which might better capture risk profiles across different age groups and loan terms.

These features create meaningful interactions between the most predictive original features (checking_status, credit_amount, duration, credit_history, purpose, age) while maintaining interpretable relationships that align with credit risk assessment logic.

Reasoning:
1. checking_status credit_history cross: Combining checking account status with credit history could reveal important patterns about financial stability and repayment behavior that aren't captured by either feature alone.

2. age duration multiply credit_amount divide installment_commitment multiply: This builds on the existing effective feature (age*duration/credit_amount) by incorporating installment commitment, creating a more comprehensive risk assessment metric that considers income burden relative to loan terms.

3. savings_status employment cross: The interaction between savings status and employment stability could provide valuable insights into financial security and ability to repay, as stable employment with good savings indicates lower risk.

Reasoning:
1. checking_status credit_history cross: Combining checking account status with credit history could reveal synergistic patterns. For example, someone with no checking account but existing paid credit history might be riskier than someone with >=200 checking and all paid history.

2. credit_amount duration multiply age divide: This creates a weighted financial burden metric. (credit_amount × duration) represents total repayment obligation, divided by age normalizes for life stage. Younger applicants with high total obligations relative to age might be higher risk.

3. savings_status employment cross: Combining savings status with employment stability could better capture financial security. For example, >=1000 savings with >=7 years employment indicates strong stability, while no known savings with unemployed suggests high risk.

These features capture interactions between financial stability indicators (checking/savings/employment), credit burden relative to life stage, and credit history patterns - all highly relevant for credit risk assessment.
