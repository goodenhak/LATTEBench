You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

2025-11-07 00:32:26,720 - INFO - LLM Output: {V1 V3 plus log, V17 V25 plus sqrt, V89 V90 plus ratio}

1. V1 V3 plus log: This feature combines clean_name_intersect_min (V1) and clean_name_levenshtein_sim (V3) using logarithmic transformation. By taking the logarithm of the sum of these features, we can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between name matching characteristics, potentially highlighting regions where entity names are more likely to be similar enough to be merged.

2. V17 V25 plus sqrt: This feature adds zip_intersect_min (V17) and street_intersect_min (V25) and applies a square root transformation. The square root transformation can help manage skewness and provide a more balanced input to the model related to the combined effects of zip code and street name similarity, which are both crucial spatial attributes for deduplication.

3. V89 V90 plus ratio: This feature calculates the ratio of the sum of phone_diff (V89) and phone_levenshtein (V90), offering a focused perspective on how differences and Levenshtein similarities in phone numbers interact. This feature might better capture the variability and comparative significance of phone number mismatches in deduplication, especially in cases where phone numbers are a critical differentiating factor.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task: Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.

2025-11-07 00:33:17,611 - INFO - LLM Output: {V101 V105 multiply V113 plus sqrt, V9 V17 multiply V57 plus exp, V102 V106 min V110 max subtract}

Reasoning/Explanation:
1. {V101 V105 multiply V113 plus sqrt}: This feature leverages geographical data differences and brings them together in a meaningful way. The multiplication of long and lat differences (V101 and V105) enhances spatial relation understanding; adding another latitude difference (V113) strengthens this relation. Applying a square root could normalize values to enhance prediction, benefiting deduplication processes.

2. {V9 V17 multiply V57 plus exp}: Combining city intersect (V9) and zip intersect (V17) simplifies understanding locality relations. Adding geocoderinputaddress (V57) further stabilizes cross-feature correlations. Applying an exponential transformation may help magnify distinctions between matched and non-matched entities.

3. {V102 V106 min V110 max subtract}: This feature uses transformations on geographical coordinate sim scores (longitude V102, latitude V106) by finding their minimum and maximum. Subtracting these extremes from each other may emphasize certain deduplication indicators within similar geographical locations—providing a broader understanding of spatial proximity in deduplication.

Reasoning/Explanation of 3 new features:

1. For V119 V120 multiply exp:
    - Exponential transformations can help model interactions in a nonlinear fashion. By multiplying two selected features and applying the exponential transformation, the model may capture complex relationships between the features, potentially increasing prediction accuracy.

2. For V121 V122 min V123 plus log:
    - Taking the minimum of two features, adding a third feature, and applying a logarithmic transformation can help in managing outliers and skewness. This transformation aims to capture underlying hidden relationships that may not be initially obvious, potentially revealing interactions that straightforward linear models may miss.

3. For V124 reciprocal sqrt:
    - Applying a reciprocal transformation followed by a square root can be beneficial for handling skewed distributions, particularly those that involve large values or have right-tailed distributions. This transformation could potentially improve the symmetry of the feature distribution, aiding in better model learning.

Answer: 1.0


Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):
top 1: new features = {V101 V105 multiply V113 plus sqrt,  V9 V17 multiply V57 plus exp,  V102 V106 min V110 max subtract}, score = 0.0005802988539097553

Reasoning/Explanation of 3 new features:
1. V6 V2 plus cosine: This feature attempts to capture the potential relationship between the name similarity scores by combining clean_name_trigram_term (V6) and clean_name_intersect_max (V2). Applying the cosine takes into account the relative angle made by these combined scores over the unit circle, possibly enhancing the ability to differentiate between similar and dissimilar data points.

2. V99 V89 min exp: This feature calculates the exponential of the minimum similarity score between the street_number_trigram (V99) and phone_diff (V89). This transformation might help in identifying subtle patterns by amplifying smaller values, providing a non-linear view on the effect these features have in determining if two records should be merged.

3. V90 5 bin V90_label V6 V2 multiply V90_label groupbythenmean: Converts the continuous phone_levenshtein (V90) feature into a categorical feature using binning, then uses this binned version as a grouping key to calculate the mean of the product of name similarity scores V6 and V2 across each phone similarity bin. This approach adds categorical insight and could capture cluster-specific similarity interactions that are otherwise missed with purely numeric features.

2025-11-07 00:35:29,326 - INFO - LLM Output: {V6 V7 multiply sqrt, V90 V91 multiply V92 plus sqrt, V101 V117 multiply V113 plus exp}

1. {V6 V7 multiply sqrt}  
   *Reasoning/Explanation*: This feature captures the interaction between the clean name trigram term similarity (V6) and whether the clean name includes another (V7). By multiplying these two features, we are trying to emphasize instances where both name similarity and inclusion are significant. Applying the square root is useful to scale the resulting value, making the new feature more comparable to other normalized features in the dataset.

2. {V90 V91 multiply V92 plus sqrt}  
   *Reasoning/Explanation*: This feature combines phonetic similarities and potential equality of phone numbers using the Levenshtein distance (V90 and V91) and phone equality (V92). By multiplying V90 and V91, we capture a shared measure of phonetic similarity, and by adding V92 and taking the square root, we emphasize cases with strong similarity as well as equality, leveraging both qualitative and binary categorical insights.

3. {V101 V117 multiply V113 plus exp}  
   *Reasoning/Explanation*: This feature leverages higher order spatial relationship features—geocode longitude difference V101 with geocode coordinate difference V117—which are already positive differences. Multiplying complements their interaction, while exp amplifies the significance of extremely close geographic points, potentially highlighting high confidence in merged or duplicate entities, especially when small differences exist.

2025-11-07 00:36:08,435 - INFO - LLM Output: {V89 V91 multiply log, V65 V70 plus sqrt, V9 V10 cross V7 label_encode}

1. V89 V91 multiply log: This feature combines the similarity distances of phone numbers (V89: phone_diff and V91: phone_trigram) by first multiplying them to capture any compound relationship, and then taking the logarithm to compress the scale and address potential non-linearity.

2. V65 V70 plus sqrt: This feature adds the similarity measures related to geocoding output addresses (V65: geocoderoutputaddress_intersect_min and V70: geocoderoutputaddress_trigram_term) to amalgamate their contributions to address similarity and applies square root normalization to reduce skewness and scale differences.

3. V9 V10 cross V7 label_encode: This feature forms a cross interaction between city intersection measures (V9: city_intersect_min and V10: city_intersect_max) and incorporates the categorical feature (V7: clean_name_including) by transforming it into a numerical feature through label encoding. This helps to represent complex interactions between city location entities and assess their relational impact in deduplication.

2025-11-07 00:36:48,707 - INFO - LLM Output: {V6 V7 multiply log, V90 V91 min sqrt, V92 V93 subtract abs}

Reasoning/Explanation of the three new features:

1. V6 V7 multiply log
   - This feature combines clean_name_trigram_term (V6) and clean_name_including (V7) by multiplying them first and then applying a logarithmic transformation. 
   - The use of multiplication allows leveraging the interaction between the trigram similarity and inclusion metrics, while taking the log can help in normalizing the data. This normalization could highlight multiplicative relationships, which may aid in distinguishing between merged and non-merged entities. 

2. V90 V91 min sqrt
   - This feature selects the minimum value between phone_levenshtein (V90) and phone_trigram (V91) and applies a square root transformation. 
   - Since both features assess different aspects of phone number similarity, selecting the minimum value may highlight the threshold where both measures agree in detecting differences. Applying a square root transformation can help in reducing the skewness in data, potentially increasing the model's sensitivity to small variations which could be crucial in detecting deduplication.
   
3. V92 V93 subtract abs
   - The feature takes the difference between phone_equality (V92) and fax_diff (V93) and applies an absolute value transformation. 
   - The difference highlights discrepancies between phone and fax information while the absolute value ensures positivity, keeping the focus on the magnitude of this difference regardless of direction. This feature could be useful when merging records where phone and fax information play a critical role in determining identity similarity.

2025-11-07 00:37:31,449 - INFO - LLM Output: {V101 V105 plus log, V90 V89 divide abs, V7 V100 cross} 

1. {V101 V105 plus log}:
   - Reasoning/Explanation: This feature combines geographical differences, specifically longitude differences (V101) and latitude differences (V105) of coordinates for the spots, using a logarithmic transformation which can help normalize the data distribution, potentially amplifying small differences that may be crucial for disambiguating locations.

2. {V90 V89 divide abs}:
   - Reasoning/Explanation: This feature involves dividing the Levenshtein similarity of phone numbers (V90) by the phone number difference (V89). Then, taking the absolute value can help highlight substantial discrepancies in phone numbers between spots. This can be crucial for deduplication, as correctly identifying phone differences is often a critical aspect of determining spot identity.

3. {V7 V100 cross}:
   - Reasoning/Explanation: Cross these features, where V7 represents whether one name includes another, and V100 measures street number equality. Combining these could help identify if street number matches are significant when considering name inclusion, which can aid in determining if a spot should be merged, thus improving deduplication results.

2025-11-07 00:38:14,232 - INFO - LLM Output: {V6 V4 multiply log, V99 V97 subtract abs, V1 V2 V3 multiply zscore}

1. V6 V4 multiply log: This feature aims to explore a nonlinear interaction between clean_name_trigram_term (V6) and clean_name_trigram_sim (V4). By multiplying these two features, we emphasize places where both the trigram term and similarity are high, indicating a potential match in clean names. Taking the logarithm can help in transforming multiplicative scales to additive ones, which can be beneficial in reducing skewness and possibly revealing further insights into name matching patterns.

2. V99 V97 subtract abs: This feature computes the absolute difference between street_number_trigram (V99) and street_number_diff (V97). The trigram representation and the difference in street numbers can indicate similarities or differences in addresses. This transformation focuses on capturing the disparity between these representations, which may help uncover mismatches or further refine matching criteria.

3. V1 V2 V3 multiply zscore: This feature utilizes clean_name_intersect_min (V1), clean_name_intersect_max (V2), and clean_name_levenshtein_sim (V3) by multiplying them together and then standardizing the result using z-score normalization. This combined feature represents a holistic view of name intersection and similarity, providing a robust metric for name comparison. Normalizing with a z-score assists in mitigating scale effects and outlier influence, enhancing downstream model predictions.

Answer: 1.0


Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):
top 1: new features = {V101 V105 multiply V113 plus sqrt,  V9 V17 multiply V57 plus exp,  V102 V106 min V110 max subtract}, score = 0.0005802988539097553
top 2: new features = {V101 V105 plus log,  V90 V89 divide abs,  V7 V100 cross}, score = 0.0001450747134774666

Reasoning/Explanation:
1. {V68 V70 plus log}: This new feature combines geocoderoutputaddress_trigram_sim (V68) and geocoderoutputaddress_trigram_term (V70) using a logarithmic transformation of their sum. Both features are related to the similarity of address outputs, and logging could help normalize the skewed range, making this feature more robust in capturing subtle differences in address similarities.
   
2. {V7 V92 cross label_encode groupbythenmean}: This feature is crafted by cross-referencing clean_name_including (V7) and phone_equality (V92), converting the resulting categorical value into a numerical feature using label encoding, then calculating the mean across these groups. This captures and highlights patterns and trends in data based on phone number quality comparison and name inclusion patterns, which could help deduplication by understanding the average impact of these categorical interactions.

3. {V117 V118 multiply sqrt}: By multiplying geocode_coordinates_diff (V117) and coordinates_diff (V118), we emphasize geographical differences between spots. Applying the square root helps normalize these differences, aiding the model in recognizing spatial relationships and variations in geographic data more effectively, and possibly improving deduplication accuracy between nearby locations.
