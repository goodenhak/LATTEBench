checking_status credit_amount cross credit_history existing_credits cross cross
}

Reasoning:
1. checking_status_credit_amount_cross × credit_amount_duration_ratio³: This creates an interaction between the checking status/amount cross feature and the cube of the credit amount to duration ratio. The cube transformation amplifies the effect of extreme values in the ratio, which could be highly predictive when combined with checking account status.

2. credit_history_existing_credits_cross × credit_amount_duration_ratio³: Similarly, this combines the credit history/existing credits interaction with the cubed ratio. Credit history is a crucial factor in lending decisions, and amplifying its interaction with the financial capacity ratio (credit_amount/duration) could capture nuanced risk patterns.

3. checking_status_credit_amount_cross × credit_history_existing_credits_cross: This creates a higher-order interaction between the two most powerful cross features. Combining these two engineered features that already showed significant accuracy gain (0.04) could reveal even more sophisticated patterns in creditworthiness assessment by capturing complex relationships between checking status, credit amount, credit history, and existing credits.

These features leverage the existing top-performing features while creating more complex interactions and non-linear transformations that could capture subtle decision boundaries in credit approval processes.

credit_amount duration multiply credit_amount_duration_ratio subtract abs, 
age credit_amount multiply duration divide, 
checking_status credit_amount cross credit_history existing_credits cross cross
}

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply credit_amount_duration_ratio subtract abs: This creates a feature that captures the absolute difference between the actual credit amount × duration product and the existing ratio. This could reveal inconsistencies or patterns where the actual product deviates significantly from the expected ratio, which might be indicative of risk.

2. age credit_amount multiply duration divide: This creates a new ratio feature (age × credit_amount)/duration. Older applicants with larger credit amounts over shorter durations might represent different risk profiles compared to younger applicants with smaller credits over longer periods.

3. checking_status credit_amount cross credit_history existing_credits cross cross: This creates a high-level interaction feature that combines the checking status × credit amount interaction with the credit history × existing credits interaction. This complex categorical feature might capture sophisticated patterns in how these four important features interact to determine creditworthiness.
