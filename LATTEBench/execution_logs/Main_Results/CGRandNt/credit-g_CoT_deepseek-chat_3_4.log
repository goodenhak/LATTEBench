credit_amount duration multiply log, 
checking_status credit_history cross, 
credit_amount age subtract abs
}

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply log: Creates a combined measure of total credit exposure over time (amount * duration) which is then log-transformed to handle skew. This captures the overall risk exposure of the loan.

2. checking_status credit_history cross: Crosses two important categorical features that both relate to financial reliability. The interaction between checking account status and credit history may reveal patterns that individual features miss.

3. credit_amount age subtract abs: Creates a measure of how much the credit amount deviates from the applicant's age, which could indicate unusual borrowing patterns relative to life stage. The absolute value ensures we capture magnitude of deviation regardless of direction.

2025-09-21 23:44:13,963 - INFO - LLM Output: Based on the task and available features, I'll generate 3 new features that could improve credit prediction performance by capturing additional relationships and patterns in the data.

Reasoning:
1. Age-normalized credit amount: The ratio of credit amount to age could capture whether the requested credit is proportional to the applicant's life stage and earning potential.
2. Employment stability indicator: Combining employment duration with residence stability could signal overall life stability, which is important for creditworthiness.
3. Savings-to-credit ratio: The relationship between savings status and credit amount might indicate financial responsibility and ability to repay.

{credit_amount age divide, employment residence_since plus, savings_status credit_amount multiply log}

Detailed Explanation:
1. credit_amount age divide - Creates a normalized credit amount relative to age, which might be more predictive than raw credit amount
2. employment residence_since plus - Combines employment stability with residence stability as a measure of overall life stability
3. savings_status credit_amount multiply log - Captures the interaction between savings capacity and credit amount, then applies log scaling for better distribution

These features leverage meaningful financial relationships that could help the model better distinguish between creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount installment_commitment multiply log: The installment commitment represents the percentage of disposable income dedicated to the credit payment. Multiplying this by the credit amount gives an estimate of the absolute financial burden relative to income. Taking the log normalizes this potentially skewed distribution, making it more suitable for linear models.

2. savings_status property_magnitude cross: Both features represent different aspects of a person's financial stability and assets. Crossing them creates a new categorical feature that captures the interaction between liquid savings (savings_status) and larger assets (property_magnitude). This combination could be highly predictive of creditworthiness as it provides a more complete picture of financial security.

3. duration age ratio log: The ratio of loan duration to age represents the relative time commitment of the loan compared to the applicant's life stage. Younger applicants with longer durations might represent higher risk, while older applicants with shorter durations might be safer. The log transformation helps handle the non-linear relationship and normalizes the distribution.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply credit_amount_installment_commitment_multiply_log multiply log: This creates a multiplicative interaction between credit amount, duration, and installment commitment (through their logged product features), capturing complex non-linear relationships between these fundamental financial variables that should strongly predict creditworthiness.

2. age employment label_encode cross: Converts employment (categorical) to numerical via label encoding, then crosses it with age. This captures how the combination of age and employment status affects credit risk (e.g., young unemployed vs older employed individuals).

3. credit_amount existing_credits multiply num_dependents multiply log: Multiplies credit amount by number of existing credits and dependents, then takes log. This captures debt burden relative to financial obligations - higher values indicate greater financial strain, which should negatively impact credit approval.

These features leverage the most predictive original features (credit_amount, duration, installment_commitment) while introducing new interactions with demographic factors (age, employment, dependents) that haven't been fully explored in the current top features. The logarithmic transformations help normalize the distributions of these multiplicative interactions.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply log credit_amount_installment_commitment_multiply_log subtract: This creates an interaction term between credit amount scaled by duration and credit amount scaled by installment commitment. The difference might capture whether these two scaling factors are consistent or divergent, which could indicate risk patterns.

2. credit_amount age subtract abs credit_amount subtract abs: This calculates the absolute difference between the credit-amount-age-difference feature and the raw credit amount. This could help identify cases where the age-adjusted credit amount differs significantly from the raw amount, potentially indicating unusual borrowing patterns for the applicant's age.

3. duration age ratio log duration_age_ratio_log log multiply: This squares the log-transformed duration-age ratio, amplifying the effect of extreme values. Age-to-duration ratios that are unusually high or low might indicate riskier loan applications that deserve more weight in the model.

These features create additional nonlinear interactions between the most important existing engineered features, potentially capturing more complex risk patterns that individual features might miss. The operations focus on amplifying extreme values and capturing inconsistencies between different scaling approaches, which are often indicators of higher risk in credit scoring models.
