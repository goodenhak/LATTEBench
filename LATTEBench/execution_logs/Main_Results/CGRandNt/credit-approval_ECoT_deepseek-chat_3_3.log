2025-09-02 12:20:26,498 - INFO - LLM Output: {
Age Debt ratio, Income CreditScore subtract, YearsEmployed Employed multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio: Debt is scaled outstanding debt, and Age is in years. The ratio of Debt to Age could represent a debt burden per year of life metric, which might be predictive of credit card application success. Younger individuals with high debt might be riskier.

2. Income CreditScore subtract: Income and CreditScore are both important financial indicators. The difference between them (after scaling) could capture the discrepancy between earning capacity and creditworthiness. A high income with a low credit score might indicate financial mismanagement.

3. YearsEmployed Employed multiply: This creates an interaction term where employed individuals get their full years of experience value, while unemployed individuals get zero. This effectively creates a meaningful employment duration feature that is only non-zero for currently employed people, which should be highly relevant for credit approval.

2025-09-02 12:20:44,711 - INFO - LLM Output: {
Age YearsEmployed plus log, 
Income Debt divide log, 
Employed PriorDefault cross
}

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed plus log: Combines age and work experience, which are both strong indicators of financial stability. The log transformation helps normalize the distribution and handle outliers.
2. Income Debt divide log: Creates a debt-to-income ratio, a fundamental financial health metric. Log transformation makes this ratio more normally distributed and handles extreme values.
3. Employed PriorDefault cross: Creates interaction between employment status and prior default history. This captures the combined effect of current employment stability and past credit behavior, which is highly relevant for credit card approval decisions.

These features capture important financial relationships that are known to be predictive in credit scoring while using appropriate transformations to handle skewed distributions and create meaningful interactions.

2025-09-02 12:21:10,368 - INFO - LLM Output: {
Age YearsEmployed plus log, 
Income Debt divide log, 
PriorDefault Employed multiply negate
}

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed plus log: Combines age and employment experience, which are both important indicators of financial stability. The log transformation helps handle the skewed distribution while preserving the additive relationship between these two maturity indicators.

2. Income Debt divide log: Creates a debt-to-income ratio, which is a fundamental financial health metric. The log transformation normalizes the extremely skewed distribution seen in the original Age_Debt_ratio feature (range up to 71,580,000), making it more suitable for modeling.

3. PriorDefault Employed multiply negate: Creates an interaction feature that identifies individuals with both prior defaults and unemployment status - a high-risk combination. The negate operation makes the feature more interpretable (higher values indicate lower risk) and helps with model convergence.

These features capture important financial relationships (debt-to-income), combine maturity indicators (age + employment experience), and create meaningful risk interactions that should improve credit card approval prediction accuracy.

Age Debt multiply Income divide,
Age YearsEmployed multiply CreditScore subtract,
BankCustomer Employed multiply PriorDefault subtract
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt multiply Income divide: Creates a debt-to-income ratio adjusted by age, which may capture financial stability better than raw ratios. Older applicants with high debt relative to income might be riskier.

2. Age YearsEmployed multiply CreditScore subtract: Combines age and employment experience then subtracts credit score. This could identify applicants with good life experience but poor credit history, which might be predictive.

3. BankCustomer Employed multiply PriorDefault subtract: Multiplies banking status with employment status then subtracts prior defaults. This creates a composite stability score where positive values indicate stable applicants without defaults.
