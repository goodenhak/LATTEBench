2025-09-02 11:17:20,430 - INFO - LLM Output: {loc n multiply log, v g reciprocal multiply, uniq_Op uniq_Opnd plus log}

Explanation:
1. {loc n multiply log}: This feature creates a logarithmic transformation of the product of loc (line count of code) and n (total operators + operands). This transformation can capture the interaction between code length and complexity, normalizing the scale of this interaction and potentially highlighting modules that are large and complex.

2. {v g reciprocal multiply}: This feature multiplies the cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) by the reciprocal (1/x transformation) of the design complexity (iv(g)). This transformation highlights modules with high cyclomatic complexity relative to their design complexity, which could signal potential defect-prone areas in the software.

3. {uniq_Op uniq_Opnd plus log}: This feature takes the log of the sum of unique operators (uniq_Op) and unique operands (uniq_Opnd). This transformation provides a normalized indication of the diversity of operations in the code, where a high variety of operations might correlate with complexity and hence, higher defect proneness.

2025-09-02 11:17:28,632 - INFO - LLM Output: To develop new features that potentially improve the accuracy of the model predicting software defects, we need to focus on interactions and transformations that could reveal underlying patterns in the data. Below are three new features generated using the available operators and existing features:

1. Cyclomatic Complexity and Branch Count Interaction: Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) measures the number of linearly independent paths through the program's source code, while branchCount represents the count of branches in the flow graph. An interaction between these two might expose complex branching patterns associated with defects.
   - RPN: {v(g) branchCount multiply zscore}

2. Halstead Volume to Lines of Code Ratio: The Halstead volume (v) is an indicator of the size of the implementation derived from the counts of operators and operands. By comparing this with the line count of code (loc), we might identify modules that handle disproportionately high complexity relative to their size, which can be defect-prone.
   - RPN: {v loc ratio log}

3. Essential Complexity and Difficulty Interaction: ev(g) represents the fraction of the complexity that is essential for the program structure, while d (difficulty) impacts how hard it is to write or understand the module. Combining these might highlight modules that are inherently complex and hard to manage.
   - RPN: {ev(g) d multiply sqrt}

These features are meticulously crafted to enhance model understanding by capturing the often complex relationships between software code metrics and their association with defects.

2025-09-02 11:17:34,927 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the software defect prediction model, feature engineering can be key. Here are three new features generated using a combination of the existing features and operators:

1. Idea: Create a feature that captures the interaction between lines of code (loc), cyclomatic complexity (v(g)), and Halstead Volume (v). This can be crucial since higher complexity or volume might lead to defects.
   - Explanation: Multiply loc and v(g) to capture the interaction between them and then adjust it by the Halstead volume using logarithm for scaling.
   - RPN: loc v g multiply v log

2. Idea: Examine a feature that evaluates the effort (e) in relation to the complexity (v(g)) and branch count. Complex code with many decision branches might require more effort, potentially leading to defects.
   - Explanation: Multiply v(g) with branchCount and divide by effort (e) to capture a possible normalization effect on the effort concerning cyclomatic complexity and branches.
   - RPN: v g branchCount multiply e divide

3. Idea: Investigate Halstead's difficulty (d) relative to the unique operators (uniq_Op) to encompass the intricate nature of the code with different operators.
   - Explanation: Create a feature that normalizes the difficulty of understanding the software using unique operators while capturing the complexity effects.
   - RPN: d uniq_Op subtract abs

Combining these aspects may provide a deeper understanding of software module characteristics contributing to defects, thus assisting the prediction model in improving its accuracy. Here’s the format with proper syntax:

2025-09-02 11:17:42,185 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance for the KC1 software defect prediction task, I will create three new features using feature engineering techniques and the provided operators. The aim is to capture more complex relationships between existing features and assist the model in making more accurate predictions.

### New Feature 1: Code Complexity Interaction with Effort
This feature captures the interaction between cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and effort (e). Higher complexity with high effort can suggest potential defects due to added difficulty in code comprehension and maintenance.

RPN: {v(g) e multiply sqrt}

### New Feature 2: Ratio of Unique Operators to Total Operators
This feature represents the diversity of operators relative to the total count, providing insights into coding practices that could impact readability and defect presence.

RPN: {uniq_Op total_Op divide}

### New Feature 3: Weighted Lines of Code Considering Comments and Blanks
By adding lines of code, comments, and blanks with an adjusted factor to account for non-functional lines, we gain a better understanding of actual code density and complexity.

RPN: {loc lOCode lOComment plus lOBlank plus sqrt}

These features aim to capture important aspects such as interaction effects, diversity in coding strategies, and effective code size, which may help in further improving the prediction of software defects.

2025-09-02 11:17:49,576 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new feature ideas for improving the downstream defect prediction model's performance:

1. Feature 1: 
   - Reasoning: The combination of cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and line count of code (loc) might provide insights into the density of complexity per line of code. A higher density might correlate with higher defect likelihood.
   - RPN: {v(g) loc divide}

2. Feature 2: 
   - Reasoning: The sum of unique operators (uniq_Op) and unique operands (uniq_Opnd) provides a measure of distinct components used in the code. A higher number of unique components might reflect complex and potentially error-prone code.
   - RPN: {uniq_Op uniq_Opnd plus}

3. Feature 3: 
   - Reasoning: The ratio of Halstead effort (e) to lines of code (loc) might indicate the effort required per line of code, potentially identifying more complex sections that are prone to defects.
   - RPN: {e loc divide}

By exploring these features and their interactions, the model might better capture the relationship between code complexity, structure, and defect proneness.

Answer: 1.0


Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):

2025-09-02 11:17:56,792 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, let's focus on generating new features that can potentially capture complex relationships between existing features. We will leverage the operators provided and focus on manipulating features that might reveal latent patterns related to software defects.

1. Feature: Interaction between Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead Effort  
   Reasoning: Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) indicates the control flow complexity, while Halstead effort (e) measures the mental effort required to understand or implement the code. Multiplying these and then applying a logarithmic transformation could help capture cases where high complexity and effort contribute to defects. 

   RPN Expression: {v(g) e multiply log}

2. Feature: Ratio of Halstead Volume to Total Operands  
   Reasoning: The ratio of Halstead's volume (v) - which measures size and complexity related to the number of operators and operands - to total operands (total_Opnd) might indicate inefficiencies or defects related to operand usage. Applying a z-score for normalization can highlight outliers.

   RPN Expression: {v total_Opnd divide zscore}

3. Feature: Exponential of Design Complexity and Unique Operands Interaction  
   Reasoning: Design complexity (iv(g)) relates to the architectural design faced by developers. Combining it with unique operands (uniq_Opnd) can highlight how diverse operand use affects complexity, and an exponential transformation can emphasize extreme cases, potentially signaling defects.

   RPN Expression: {iv(g) uniq_Opnd multiply exp}

These new features are crafted to create interactions between metrics that are indicative of software quality, complexity, and error-prone areas, potentially improving the prediction accuracy of the model.

2025-09-02 11:18:08,463 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that could potentially improve the downstream model's performance, we typically aim to capture new aspects of relationships or transformations within the existing dataset. Here's the reasoning behind the proposed features:

1. Feature Combination and Normalization (Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead Difficulty):
   - Combining cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and Halstead difficulty (d) could highlight relationships between logical complexity and coding effort, potentially revealing patterns indicative of software defects.
   - Z-score normalization can put this feature on a comparable scale, helping the model discern subtle differences.

2. Operator/Operand Ratio Z-Score:
   - The ratio of total operators (total_Op) to total operands (total_Opnd) can serve as a proxy for code density or compactness. Analyzing how this feature compares across data points using a z-score might illuminate outliers or unusual constructs that could correlate with defects.

3. Halstead Effort and Lines of Code Interaction:
   - Halstead effort (e) is an indication of the amount of work required to understand, move, and modify the code. Pairing this with the lines of code (loc) and normalizing with a z-score could capture interactions between code complexity and size, shedding light on potential sources of defects.

Here are the corresponding RPN expressions for these new features:

2025-09-02 11:18:14,043 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features for the KC1 Software defect prediction task, we aim to explore interactions and transformations that can capture non-linear relationships and perhaps high-order interactions between existing features. Let's build three new features, with an explanation for each:

1. Feature 1: Interaction between Halstead 'volume' and line count of code, followed by a non-linear transformation using cosine.  
   Reasoning: This feature captures the interaction between the size of the code implementation (Halstead volume) and the physical size of the code (lines of code). Applying the cosine function may detect periodic patterns or regularities in their relationship.
   RPN: {v loc multiply cosine}

2. Feature 2: Use absolute value and exponential transformation on Halstead 'effort' divided by McCabe's cyclomatic complexity.  
   Reasoning: This attempts to capture how much computational effort is required relative to the complexity of the code. Exponential transformation might highlight the differences more prominently, especially when effort scales significantly with complexity.
   RPN: {e v g divide abs exp}

3. Feature 3: Difference between essential complexity and design complexity, followed by a sigmoid transformation to introduce non-linearity.  
   Reasoning: This will assess the disparity between essential and design complexity, potentially highlighting structural issues within the code. The sigmoid function will help in normalizing the differences and capturing their significance in the range of [0,1].
   RPN: {ev g iv g subtract sigmoid}

These transformations aim to unlock novel insights from existing features that are not directly apparent in their raw form, thereby potentially improving the model's predictive capabilities.

2025-09-02 11:18:21,543 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new feature engineering candidates that might improve the performance of the downstream model for the KC1 Software defect prediction task, let's analyze the given features and potential transformations. The goal is to discover interactions and transformations that reveal more intricate patterns related to software defects. Here are three proposed new features:

1. Halstead Volume to Difficulty Ratio Logarithm (log transformation for skew handling):
   - Reasoning: The Halstead volume (v) and difficulty (d) metrics are both central to Halstead's model of software complexity but focus on different aspects. Their ratio may capture a balance between comprehensiveness and complexity. Using a log transformation will help in normalizing this feature, especially given the wide range of these values.
   - RPN: {v d divide log}

2. Cyclomatic Complexity and Branch Count Interaction:
   - Reasoning: Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) measures the complexity of control flow, while branchCount indicates the number of branches. Interacting these features, while applying a non-linear transformation such as the squared value might highlight complex interaction patterns that could indicate defects.
   - RPN: {v(g) branchCount multiply square}

3. Normalized Lines of Code to Unique Operators Ratio:
   - Reasoning: The number of lines of code (loc) in relation to the unique operators (uniq_Op) used signifies how dense and potentially convoluted the code is relative to its control elements. A higher ratio might suggest complexity or inefficiency in the code structure. Applying a z-score normalization calms down deviations from typical distributions.
   - RPN: {loc uniq_Op divide zscore}

These transformations provide a combination of ratios, interactions, and normalizations that could uncover new patterns relative to defect predictions. Each transformation is crafted to balance the scale, capture non-linear patterns, or reveal underlying relationships.

2025-09-02 11:18:29,419 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that could potentially enhance the prediction model's performance, I'll leverage combinations and transformations of the existing features with a focus on capturing non-linear relationships and interactions. Here are three new feature ideas formulated in Reverse Polish Notation:

1. Cyclomatic Complexity and Essential Complexity Interaction with Exponential Transform: The interaction between v(g) (cyclomatic complexity) and ev(g) (essential complexity) can give insights into the structure and decision-making paths in the code. By applying an exponential transformation, we intend to capture non-linear and potentially exponential problem areas in the complexity structure.
   
   - RPN: {v(g) ev(g) multiply exp}

2. Normalized Interaction of Unique Operators with Halstead Volume Ratio: This feature attempts to capture the relationship between the number of unique operators used and the complexity of the code as indicated by the Halstead volume-to-lines-of-code ratio. The Z-score normalization helps in reducing the effect of differing scales and emphasizes deviation from the mean.
   
   - RPN: {uniq_Op v(g)_branchCount_multiply_zscore}2._Halstead_Volume_to_Lines_of_Code_Ratio:_The_Halstead_volume_(v)_is_an_indicator_of_the_size_of_the_implementation_derived_from_the_counts_of_operators_and_operands._By_comparing_this_with_the_line_count_of_code_(loc) multiply zscore}

3. Halstead Effort and Total Operands Mean Groupby Unique Operands: This feature analyzes the average effort involved when grouped by the unique operands present in the piece of code. It provides a more detailed understanding of the effort required based on how operands are varied and used across different parts of the code.
   
   - RPN: {uniq_Opnd e total_Opnd plus uniq_Opnd groupbythenmean}

These new features aim to capture complex and high-level interactions among the available metrics, potentially leading to improved predictions of software defects.
