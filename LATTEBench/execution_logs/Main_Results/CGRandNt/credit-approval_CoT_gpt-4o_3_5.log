2025-09-22 01:06:18,085 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions for the credit card application success, we should create features that enhance the existing information captured by the dataset:

1. Capture interactions between demographics and credit behavior:
   - Age and Debt can together provide a sense of financial maturity and responsibility.
   - The interaction of Age and Debt can be captured using the cross operator.

2. Incorporate employment stability:
   - YearsEmployed and CreditScore are both indicators of financial stability and responsibility.
   - Multiply these two features to capture compounded information on stability.

3. Extract insights from categorical data:
   - Industry can give us insight into financial trends based on job sector, which might correlate with credit application success. Economic trends by industry might help leverage financial stability insight.

2025-09-22 01:06:22,653 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that may improve the prediction of credit card application success, we will focus on creating interactions between the existing variables, especially where they can capture nonlinear relationships or interactions between categorical and numerical features. Here are three proposed new features in Reverse Polish Notation with explanations:

1. YearsEmployed with Ethnicity Interaction: Individuals' employment duration may have different impacts based on their ethnicity due to cultural or systemic reasons. We capture this interaction by encoding 'Ethnicity' and multiplying it with 'YearsEmployed'.
   - RPN: {Ethnicity label_encode YearsEmployed multiply}

2. Income Normalized by Debt: People's ability to manage their income against their existing debt might be predictive of credit card approval. This feature creates a ratio of 'Income' to 'Debt', which could indicate financial stability or stress.
   - RPN: {Income Debt divide}

3. Cross between Employment and Industry Securities: The relationship between employment status and industry may vary considerably. Combining these features can account for how employment in certain industries might be more secure or less risky, impacting creditworthiness.
   - RPN: {Employed Industry label_encode cross}

These features aim to uncover hidden insights or patterns that the current model might be missing, potentially improving prediction performance on the credit card application success task.

Explanation:

1. Income YearsEmployed multiply log: Multiplying Income and YearsEmployed might capture the relationship between longer employment duration and higher income, often associated with a better credit application profile. Applying log transformation can help model non-linear relationships.

2. Ethnicity CreditScore YearsEmployed_CreditScore_multiply cross concat: Creating a cross feature by combining Ethnicity and CreditScore, then concatenating it with the YearsEmployed_CreditScore_multiply captures ethnic diversity effects and the compounded credit score dynamics influenced by employment years, potentially enriching the model with socio-demographic and scoring trends.

3. Employed Debt sqrt multiply Age subtract: Multiplying Employed with the square root of Debt could highlight the impact of employment in relation to manageable debt levels. Subtracting Age could adjust for age-related biases, aiming to provide a balanced perspective on credit card application success.

2025-09-22 01:06:34,920 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that may enhance the prediction accuracy of whether individuals are successful in applying for a credit card, we can use domain knowledge and feature interactions that might reveal underlying patterns not captured by the existing features. Here are three new features, implemented in Reverse Polish Notation:

1. YearsEmployed adjusted by Credit Score growth: This feature considers the interaction between years employed and credit score, then applies an exponential transformation to emphasize the differences in impact of credit growth over employment duration.

   RPN: {YearsEmployed CreditScore plus exp}

2. Debt normalized by Age and Income: This feature provides a normalization of debt using age and income, which might capture the relative financial burden on individuals more effectively than using debt alone. It uses a z-score normalization which helps in assessing the debt concerning the distribution of age and income.

   RPN: {Debt Age Income plus zscore}

3. Industry-specific Income Analysis: Using target encoding to understand the pattern of income within industries could highlight how income distribution varies by the job sector, potentially revealing which industries feature individuals with higher chances of credit card approval.

   RPN: {Industry Income target_encoding}

These features are designed to unveil hidden relationships or patterns between the existing attributes, potentially contributing to a more nuanced and accurate downstream prediction of credit card approval success.

2025-09-22 01:06:47,544 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate three new features with the goal of improving model performance, let's consider the available operators and existing features, focusing on creating interactions or transformations that make intuitive sense and could capture underlying patterns or relationships. 

### New Feature 1: Employed Influence on Credit Approval
There's potential value in exploring the relationship between employment status and industry-related income target encoding. Employed individuals in certain industries might have varying success rates for credit card approval compared to those not employed.

RPN: {Employed Industry label_encode multiply}

Reasoning: Combining employment status with industry-related encoding might reveal how employment impacts credit approval within different industries.

---

### New Feature 2: Prior Default and Debt Correlation
Individuals with prior defaults might have a distinct pattern in how their normalized debt levels correlate with credit card approval likelihood. It's worth cross verifying this.

RPN: {PriorDefault YearsEmployed_CreditScore_plus_exp}2._Debt_normalized_by_Age_and_Income:_This_feature_provides_a_normalization_of_debt_using_age_and_income cross}

Reasoning: Cross product of prior default with normalized debt values could help detect differences in approval tendencies between those who previously defaulted and those who didn't.

---

### New Feature 3: Ethnicity Influence through Debt Normalization
Exploring the intersection of ethnicity with normalized debt might uncover variations in credit approval tendencies across different ethnic groups.

RPN: {Ethnicity YearsEmployed_CreditScore_plus_exp}2._Debt_normalized_by_Age_and_Income:_This_feature_provides_a_normalization_of_debt_using_age_and_income cross}

Reasoning: Ethnicity combined with debt normalization can expose diversities in credit approval patterns that are specific to different ethnic groups, highlighting demographic-specific insights.

These selected features are designed to explore meaningful interactions within the dataset that could influence credit card approval, leveraging transformations and cross products to capture potential nonlinear relationships or categorically specific insights.

2025-09-22 01:06:55,028 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we'll focus on creating new features that leverage interactions between existing features and transformations that might better capture the underlying patterns of the data. Here's the reasoning and proposal for generating three new features:

1. Capture Interaction between Industry Income and Default Risks
   - The first new feature aims to explore the impact of industry income target encoding on individuals with prior default history. By capturing the median behavior, we may help to more accurately predict credit card approval chances for individuals who have defaulted in the past.
   - RPN: Industry_Income_target_encoding PriorDefault multiply PriorDefault groupbythenmedian

2. Extract Ethnic Variation on Employment and Industry Income
   - This feature explores the groupbythenmean operation on industry income target encoding, capturing potential ethnicity impacts that might be affecting credit card approvals within different ethnic groups.
   - RPN: Ethnicity Industry_Income_target_encoding groupbythenmean

3. Leverage Employment and Income Multiplication with Sine Transformation
   - Sine transformation could capture cyclical patterns or relationships between employment and industry income, potentially making predictions more accurate by capturing more nuanced interactions.
   - RPN: Industry_Income_target_encoding_Employed_multiply_log Industry_Income_target_encoding multiply sine

Output RPN:

{Industry_Income_target_encoding PriorDefault multiply PriorDefault groupbythenmedian, Ethnicity Industry_Income_target_encoding groupbythenmean, Industry_Income_target_encoding_Employed_multiply_log Industry_Income_target_encoding multiply sine}

2025-09-22 01:07:00,872 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the prediction model's performance, we need to derive insights that can potentially enhance the distinction between successful and unsuccessful credit card applications. Let's explore and construct three features using both existing features and operators:

1. Construct a feature using target encoding and the prior default to capture patterns from successful industries paired with prior default behavior.
2. Leverage temporal and behavioral patterns, e.g., combine the ethnic distribution with the target encoding for nuanced insights.
3. Explore multiplicative correlations between already identified strong predictors such as YearsEmployed and PriorDefault.

Here's my proposed set of new features:

1. Feature 1: Utilize potentially_revealing_which_industries_feature_individuals_with_higher_chances_of_credit_card_approval._RPN:{Industry_Income_target_encoding}, combined with prior default behavioral patterns that have shown predictive strength. 

2. Feature 2: Capture additional ethnic and industry income interactions to see if there are specific ethnic-industry considerations that affect credit card approval likelihood.

3. Feature 3: Examine multiplicative interactions between existing strong predictors of credit card approval.

Output for these features in Reverse Polish Notation:

text
{
    Ethnicity PriorDefault cross potentially_revealing_which_industries_feature_individuals_with_higher_chances_of_credit_card_approval._RPN:{Industry_Income_target_encoding multiply, 
    Ethnicity potentially_revealing_which_industries_feature_individuals_with_higher_chances_of_credit_card_approval._RPN:{Industry_Income_target_encoding_cross groupbythenmean, 
    YearsEmployed Potentially_revealing_which_industries_feature_individuals_with_higher_chances_of_credit_card_approval._RPN:{Industry_Income_target_encoding multiply PriorDefault multiply
}


Explanation:
1. Feature 1 leverages cross-interaction followed by multiplication to connect industry income patterns with ethnic and prior default behaviors, potentially capturing an impactful relationship.
2. Feature 2 situates mean-based groupings within ethnic and industry spheres, allowing for the discovery of feature-specific variations across ethnic lines.
3. Feature 3 takes a previously impactful combination (YearsEmployed with PriorDefault) and enhances it with interactions related to industry income, striving to uncover correlations particularly impactful on a multiplicative scale.
