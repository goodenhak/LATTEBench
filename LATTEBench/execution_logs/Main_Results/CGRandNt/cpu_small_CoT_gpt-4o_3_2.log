2025-10-15 14:55:25,266 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar wchar ratio log, freemem freemem freemem multiply sqrt, scall exec plus ratio}

Explanation/Reasoning:
1. rchar wchar ratio log: 
   - We use the ratio between rchar and wchar to capture how data read and write operations relate to each other in terms of character transfers per second. By applying the logarithm transformation, we aim to handle the wide range and skewness in character transfer data, potentially improving the model's capture of non-linear relationships.

2. freemem freemem freemem multiply sqrt:
   - Transforming freemem by cubing and then taking the square root helps explore the nonlinear effects of available memory pages on user CPU mode time prediction. Memory might have complex effects on performance metrics, and this transformation aims to capture such effects.

3. scall exec plus ratio:
   - The ratio of the sum of system calls (scall) and execution calls (exec) aims to understand how general system interaction combined with execution efforts impacts user mode CPU activity. This captures CPU usage dynamics in terms of system operations and execution-heavy processes.

2025-10-15 14:55:38,063 - INFO - LLM Output: {freemem sqrt exec 0.5 multiply cosine plus, lread freemem divide fork plus sqrt, sread swrite plus scall multiply sqrt}

1. {freemem sqrt exec 0.5 multiply cosine plus}:
   - Reasoning: 
     - The square root of freemem can capture the dynamics in available memory by reducing the effect of very high values. 
     - The cosine transformation of the product of exec and a constant can help capture cyclical patterns in execution processes related to memory.
     - Combining memory availability with execution activity could reveal latent interactions affecting CPU usage patterns.
   
2. {lread freemem divide fork plus sqrt}:
   - Reasoning: 
     - Dividing lread by freemem can evaluate the efficiency of memory reads relative to available memory.
     - Adding fork and then applying square root helps to moderate the values since these operations create new processes, possibly affecting CPU user mode duration. 
     - This combination could provide insights into how read operations paired with process creation impact CPU load in user mode.
   
3. {sread swrite plus scall multiply sqrt}:
   - Reasoning: 
     - Summing sread and swrite gives an overall measure of system I/O operations.
     - Multiplying by scall encompasses system calls and further accentuates the influence of system activity.
     - Applying square root tends to stabilize variability, potentially unveiling subtle relationships between I/O operations and CPU user mode time.

2025-10-15 14:56:02,978 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread freemem divide log, exec fork multiply sqrt, sread swrite plus reciprocal}

These engineered features aim to enhance the model's capacity to predict CPU time running in user mode:

1. {lread freemem divide log}: Taking the logarithm of the ratio between lread and freemem helps stabilize the variance and normalize the distribution, allowing the model to distinguish between situations where memory reads are efficient even under different memory availability levels.

2. {exec fork multiply sqrt}: This feature captures the complexity and interaction between exec and fork calls, incorporating a non-linear transformation to reduce skewness. By applying the square root, we mitigate the impact of high values while still acknowledging areas with intensive process creation activity.

3. {sread swrite plus reciprocal}: This feature evaluates the system's read and write call rates by summing them and applying a reciprocal transformation. This emphasizes lower values, highlighting instances where read and write operations are minimal due to potential I/O bottlenecks or other factors limiting CPU user mode activity.

2025-10-15 14:56:18,868 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar freemem divide log, lread runqsz multiply sqrt, scall exec multiply divide} 

Explanation:

1. rchar freemem divide log: This feature aims to capture the information throughput efficiency related to the available memory. By dividing rchar by freemem, we assess how efficiently the character reads are being managed based on available memory. Taking the logarithm can help normalize the effect and reveal patterns in the data related to information throughput efficiency.

2. lread runqsz multiply sqrt: This feature looks at the interaction between the amount of data read from memory (lread) and the process run queue size (runqsz), which can be an indicator of how busy the CPU is. By multiplying the two and then taking the square root, we can moderate the feature's values while capturing their combined effect on CPU usage.

3. scall exec multiply divide: This feature is constructed by multiplying scall (system calls) with exec (execution calls) and dividing by the overall data scale (like an appropriate normalization constant, which isn't explicitly specified here but can be assumed to adjust the range). This feature could reveal how resource-intensive calls influence the user-mode CPU time, by observing how execution-intensive operations scale with system call operations.

Reasoning/Explanation:
1. lread lwrite plus rchar add log: Combining reads and writes with the number of characters read can give a measure of overall I/O activity. Applying logarithm transformation helps to manage skewness and stabilize variance, revealing relationships with CPU usage that are not linear.

2. scall sqrt freemem divide multiply: The relationship between the number of system calls and available memory can be complex, but dividing the square root of calls by available memory can highlight how efficiently system resources are used. Multiplying this interaction attempts to encapsulate the load on CPU due to system calls adjusted for available resources.

3. exec abs freemem sqrt subtract: Taking the absolute value of exec calls and adjusting it by subtracting the square root of available memory can accentuate the influence of execution activity in relation to memory availability, potentially uncovering hidden patterns affecting CPU's time spent in user mode.

2025-10-15 14:56:47,542 - INFO - LLM Output: {rchar scall multiply sqrt, lwrite sqrt freemem divide, exec freemem multiply sqrt}

Explanation:

1. {rchar scall multiply sqrt}: 
   - The number of characters transferred can be critical for assessing the load on CPU due to read operations. Combining rchar with scall could expose insights linked to system call efficiency and memory transfer efficiency. Applying sqrt can reduce the range and impact of large values, possibly balancing the distribution.

2. {lwrite sqrt freemem divide}: 
   - The lwrite feature addresses memory writes. By taking the square root of lwrite, we linearize its effect, especially when over a wide range. Dividing by freemem relates the memory writing activity to the amount of free memory, potentially exposing strained conditions where high writes meet low memory.

3. {exec freemem multiply sqrt}:
   - The number of exec calls indicates process executions. Multiplying exec with freemem gives an insight on execution efficiency, which would be lowered when memory is scarce. Taking the square root helps moderate extreme values, potentially highlighting execution-memory relationships more clearly.

- lread swrite multiply exec divide log: This feature captures the logarithm of the ratio of lread and swrite product over exec. The multiplication of memory reads and writes could provide insights into memory-bound operations impacting cpu usage, and dividing by exec connects it to the execution context.

- runqsz freemem ratio sqrt: This feature calculates the square root of the ratio between process run queue size and available memory pages. It measures the resource backlog relative to memory capacity, potentially highlighting constraints affecting CPU performance.

- rchar wchar plus scall multiply zscore: This feature computes the z-score of the combined character transfers from system read and write operations, further multiplied by the number of system calls. This helps standardize the data and highlight anomalies in data transfer rates, which might reflect CPU activity patterns.

2025-10-15 14:57:16,824 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread sqrt, exec sqrt, freemem freemem multiply exec sqrt divide plus sqrt, scall fork ratio log}

1. {lread sqrt}: By taking the square root of the lread feature, we can reduce the influence of extremely high values and capture the more subtle patterns in the data related to memory readings.
   
2. {exec sqrt}: Similar to the first feature, we take the square root of exec to manage the effects of extreme execution values. This can capture fluctuations in execution activity more effectively.

3. {freemem freemem multiply exec sqrt divide plus sqrt}: This is a more complex feature that aims to capture interactions between available memory and execution activity. By first multiplying freemem with itself, it amplifies the variance in memory availability. Then, we divide it by the square root of exec to moderate the influence of execution processes. Finally, applying a square root to the entire expression helps balance the scale of this new feature.

4. {scall fork ratio log}: This feature takes the ratio of scall (system calls) to forks, which could represent how many system calls are associated with process creation. Applying log normalizes the data range while highlighting the variance in these interactions.

2025-10-15 14:57:31,897 - INFO - LLM Output: {lread freemem divide negate log, exec sqrt fork multiply plus exp, freemem scall divide lread multiply sqrt}

Reasoning/Explanation:

1. lread freemem divide negate log: This feature takes the ratio of lread to freemem, applies negation and then takes the logarithm. By examining this transformation, we can gain insights into how memory read operations are balanced against available memory; extreme variations here could influence CPU usage.

2. exec sqrt fork multiply plus exp: This feature combines the square root of exec and the product of fork, then applies the exponential function. This complex calculation aims to capture interactions between execution and process creation activities, possibly affecting CPU behavior under different conditions.

3. freemem scall divide lread multiply sqrt: This feature looks at the square root of the weighted effect of system calls and memory availability (freemem divided by scall) along with lread, giving an understanding of CPU usage patterns as they are influenced by memory and system call interplay.
