2025-09-02 12:30:16,763 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three engineered features designed to capture different aspects of applicant risk and stability:

1. “Relative Local Income”: how an applicant’s income compares to the average income in their ZIP code—highlights whether they are better‐off or worse‐off than their neighbors.  
2. “Employment Stability Ratio”: the fraction of an applicant’s life they have been employed—serves as a proxy for work stability and maturity.  
3. “Industry Credit Benchmark”: the average credit score within each industry—captures industry‐specific creditworthiness norms.

2025-09-02 12:30:50,706 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three candidate features along with the intuition:

1. Income deviation × Employed  
   – Only employed people’s income deviation from their ZIP‐area mean matters for repayment capacity.  
2. CreditScore – Debt  
   – The raw difference between scaled credit score and outstanding debt captures “credit cushion.”  
3. Mean CreditScore by Ethnicity  
   – Encodes group‐level credit behavior patterns that may affect approval.

2025-09-02 12:33:07,112 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features (in RPN) along with the intuition behind each:

1. CreditScore Debt multiply  
   – Combines raw creditworthiness with current debt load to capture clients who both have a history of on‐time payments (higher score) but also high outstanding debt, or vice versa.  
2. YearsEmployed Income_ZipCode_Income_groupbythenmean_subtract multiply abs  
   – Multiplies tenure at current job by how far their income deviates from the ZIP‐code average, then takes absolute value. This flags long‐tenured employees in unusually high‐ or low‐income brackets for their neighborhood.  
3. Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean  
   – Calculates the industry‐level prior‐default rate, giving a sector‐specific default risk baseline.

Output in RPN:

{CreditScore Debt multiply, YearsEmployed Income_ZipCode_Income_groupbythenmean_subtract multiply abs, Industry PriorDefault groupbythenmean}

2. Log‐transformed debt: smooths the right‐skewed debt distribution to reduce the impact of extreme values.  
3. Debt‐to‐credit ratio: measures indebtedness relative to credit score (plus one) to avoid division by zero and emphasize applicants with high debt but low creditworthiness.

Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):
top 1: new features = {Income ZipCode Income groupbythenmean subtract,  YearsEmployed Age divide,  Industry CreditScore groupbythenmean}, score = 0.007246376811594235
top 2: new features = {YearsEmployed Industry YearsEmployed groupbythenmean subtract,  Debt 1 plus log,  Debt CreditScore 1 plus divide}, score = 0.007246376811594235

2025-09-02 12:34:40,477 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed features (in RPN), chosen to capture key risk/eligibility interactions:

1. Normalize log‐debt by tenure: a high log‐debt burden when tenure is short is risky  
2. Interaction of credit score with relative income: high‐score applicants above their ZIP‐income average are stronger  
3. Squared deviation in tenure from industry norm: extreme under/over‐tenure may indicate instability
