1. Debt-to-Income Ratio  
   – Captures how burdened a person’s debt is relative to their income, which is a strong predictor of creditworthiness.  
2. Employment Stability Ratio  
   – Measures the portion of one’s life spent employed (years employed divided by age), signaling work history stability.  
3. Relative Credit Score  
   – Normalizes an individual’s credit score by their industry’s average credit score, highlighting how they compare to peers.

2) Industry CreditScore groupbythenmean captures the typical credit-worthiness of each industry.  
3) Employed BankCustomer plus DriversLicense plus counts how many basic financial/ID credentials a person has (0–3).

   – Rationale: a classic credit metric is the debt‐to‐income ratio, which directly measures how leveraged an individual is given their earnings.  
3. ZipCode 10 bin target_encoding  
   – Rationale: geographic areas (binned zip codes) often correlate with credit behavior; target encoding these bins lets the model learn location‐based approval patterns.  

Final RPN expressions:

{Industry Income groupbythenmean, Debt Income ratio, ZipCode 10 bin target_encoding}

Reasoning:
1. Industry CreditScore groupbythenmean: captures typical creditworthiness within each industry, enriching the existing industry–income statistic with financial behavior signals.
2. ZipCode_10_bin_target_encoding Income multiply: interacts localized approval rates (via ZIP bin target encoding) with applicant income, weighting income by regional approval likelihood.
3. Income YearsEmployed divide log: models “income per year employed” on a logarithmic scale to reflect productivity and career stability, reducing skew from extreme values.

2025-09-02 12:43:49,309 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three candidate features designed to capture non‐linear interactions and group‐specific patterns that the base model may be missing:

1. “Debt vs. Typical Industry Income”  
   By dividing an individual’s debt by the average income of their industry, we normalize debt levels relative to peers. This highlights customers whose debt is unusually high (or low) given their industry context.

2. “Interaction of Credit Score with Prior Defaults”  
   Multiplying CreditScore by PriorDefault lets the model see whether having a prior default at different score levels impacts approval likelihood differently (e.g. a high‐score defaulter vs. a low‐score one).

3. “Within‐Industry Credit Score Rank”  
   Ranking each applicant’s credit score within their industry group reveals relative standing: a middle‐of‐the‐pack score in a high‐scoring industry may be riskier than the same raw score elsewhere.

RPN expressions for these features:

2025-09-02 12:44:58,750 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed features with their motivations:

1.  CreditScore / Debt_Income_ratio_sqrt  
    - Captures the balance between an applicant’s creditworthiness and their leveraged position (higher ratio means relatively strong credit vs debt load).

2.  Industry‐level dispersion of Debt_Income_ratio  
    - Computes the standard deviation of debt‐to‐income ratios within each industry to gauge how an applicant’s leverage compares to their industry peers.

3.  Interaction of Industry and Married  
    - Encodes how marital status effects may vary by industry sector, allowing the model to learn sector‐specific marital risk patterns.

RPN expressions for these features:
{CreditScore Debt_Income_ratio_sqrt divide, Industry Debt_Income_ratio groupbythenstd, Industry Married cross}
