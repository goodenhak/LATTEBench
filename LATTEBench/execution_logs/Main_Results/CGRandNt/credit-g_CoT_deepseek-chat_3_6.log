age credit_amount multiply log, 
checking_status savings_status cross, 
employment duration groupbythenmean
}

Reasoning:
1. age credit_amount multiply log: 
   - Multiplying age and credit_amount creates an interaction term that represents lifecycle credit capacity (older clients may handle larger credits differently).
   - Applying log transformation normalizes the skewed distribution and captures non-linear relationships.
   - This could help distinguish between younger applicants with small credits vs older applicants with large credits.

2. checking_status savings_status cross:
   - Cross between checking and savings status captures the combined financial stability picture.
   - Clients with both good checking (>=200) and good savings (>=1000) likely have stronger financial positions.
   - Those with negative checking and no savings would represent highest risk profiles.

3. employment duration groupbythenmean:
   - Groups by employment status and calculates mean duration for each group.
   - Reveals patterns like: unemployed applicants might have shorter average loan durations, while long-term employed might have longer durations.
   - Captures employment stability's relationship with typical loan terms requested.

These features complement the existing top features by adding financial capacity indicators, cross-feature interactions, and employment-based grouping patterns.
