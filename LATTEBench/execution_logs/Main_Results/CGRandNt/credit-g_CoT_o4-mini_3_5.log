Reasoning:
1. credit_amount_duration_divide credit_history_credit_amount_groupbythenmean divide log  
   - Captures how heavy the applicant’s monthly burden is relative to their historical average credit. The log dampens extremes.

2. employment credit_amount_duration_divide groupbythenmean  
   - Aggregates average monthly burden per employment category, highlighting risk patterns tied to job stability.

3. duration residence_since divide zscore  
   - Measures loan length relative to residence stability, then standardizes it to detect unusually long loans for those with short residence histories.

1. Interaction of credit‐per‐duration with average credit history amount  
   – Captures how an applicant’s normalized credit request (credit_amount_duration_divide) scales against the population mean (credit_history_credit_amount_groupbythenmean), adjusted by loan duration.

2. Cross of checking account status and binned credit‐per‐duration  
   – Bins the continuous ratio into 5 groups to capture non‐linear effects, then crosses with checking_status to model joint category risks.

3. Standardized per‐month telephone/amount interaction  
   – Divides the telephone‐augmented amount (own_telephone_label_encode_credit_amount_duration_divide_multiply) by duration to get a per‐month value, then z‐scores it for comparability.

Final RPN expressions:

2025-09-22 00:01:51,305 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three interaction‐style features designed to capture relative load and joint effects:

1. “Relative monthly credit to peers with similar employment”  
   By grouping on employment we see if someone’s per‐month obligation is unusually large for their job‐tenure group.  
2. “Interaction of checking account status with monthly credit”  
   A sound checking history may mitigate risk of a large monthly payment (or vice versa).  
3. “Joint category of binned monthly payment and checking status”  
   Creates a small cross–tab capturing thresholds of payment burden by account health.
