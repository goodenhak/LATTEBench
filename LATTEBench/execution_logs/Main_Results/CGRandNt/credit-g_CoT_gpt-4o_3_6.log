2025-09-22 02:11:44,490 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the predictive model's performance, let's design three new features using different combinations of operators and existing features. We aim to capture unique and relevant interactions or transformations that could improve model accuracy for predicting credit approval.

1. Feature 1: Interaction of Employment Duration and Credit History
   - Reasoning: The employment duration may have different impacts on credit approval based on the credit history category. Grouping by credit history and taking the mean employment duration can provide a contextual understanding of the applicant's job stability and financial credibility.
   - RPN: 
     {credit_history employment duration label_encode groupbythenmean}

2. Feature 2: Ratio of Credit Amount to Savings and Checking Status
   - Reasoning: The ratio of the requested credit amount to the applicant's financial resources (savings and checking status) is critical in assessing their ability to repay the loan. This gives a tangible measure of risk associated with the applicant's financial request versus their available resources.
   - RPN: 
     {credit_amount savings_status label_encode checking_status label_encode plus ratio}

3. Feature 3: Composite Personal and Employment Status Feature
   - Reasoning: Combining personal status with employment information might reveal insights into the applicant's lifestyle and stability. It could indicate reliability and readiness for credit based on social responsibilities and job involvement.
   - RPN:
     {personal_status employment cross}

These features aim to enhance the model's ability to discern patterns related to creditworthiness, incorporating financial, behavioral, and lifestyle information.

2025-09-22 02:11:48,601 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating new features to improve model performance involves selecting meaningful transformations that can uncover hidden patterns in the data. Below are three proposed new features and the reasoning behind them:

1. Composite Age and Employment Feature:  
   Combining age and employment status can provide insight into the stability and readiness of an applicant for credit. For instance, older applicants with stable employment could be seen as less risky.
   - RPN: {age employment label_encode plus}

2. Credit Amount Normalized by Duration:  
   This feature looks at credit amount in relation to the duration of the credit request. It's a form of normalization to understand how reasonable the credit amount is relative to the repayment period, potentially indicating risk or affordability.
   - RPN: {credit_amount duration divide log}

3. Interaction between Checking and Savings Status:  
Understanding how checking and savings status interact can reveal the applicant's financial stability and resource distribution. This interaction can be pivotal for assessing creditworthiness.
   - RPN: {checking_status label_encode savings_status label_encode cross}

These features attempt to capture different aspects of financial behavior and stability that can influence creditworthiness and reduce risk assessment error in predictions.

2025-09-22 02:11:52,436 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three proposed new features with reasoning:

1. Interaction Between Credit History and Duration: Understanding how credit history interacts with the duration of the credit request might provide insights into the applicant's historical reliability and how optimistic they are about repaying the loan over time. This can be useful for assessing credit risk.

   RPN: {credit_history label_encode duration divide}

2. Composite Feature of Personal Status, Employment, and Residence: By combining personal status, employment, and residence data, we can get a broader view of an applicant's social stability and long-term residency, which can correlate with credit reliability.

   RPN: {personal_status employment cross residence_since cross}

3. Ratio of Credit Amount to Duration Normalized by Checking Status: This feature examines the applicant's requested credit amount relative to both the duration they've chosen and their checking account status. Normalizing this ratio can help in understanding affordability relative to their immediate financial status.

   RPN: {credit_amount duration divide checking_status label_encode ratio}

2025-09-22 02:11:57,332 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the model's performance for predicting credit approval, I'll focus on crafting features that combine existing data to better capture the applicant's financial habits, stability, and risk assessment. Here are three new feature suggestions:

1. Credit-to-Duration-and-Purpose Interaction:
   The interaction between the credit amount, its intended purpose, and the duration can provide insights into financial habits and repayment reliability. By encoding purpose and interacting with the credit amount normalized by duration, we can see how prepared the applicant is for the financial commitment.
   - RPN: {credit_amount duration divide purpose label_encode cross}

2. Job and Residence Stability Index:
   A measure that combines job type and years of residence can indicate an applicant's socioeconomic stability. A more stable employment and longer residence since may suggest a lower credit risk.
   - RPN: {job label_encode residence_since multiply}

3. Checking and Other Payment Plans Synergy:
   Analyzing how an applicant's checking status interacts with additional payment plans can reveal financial management strategies. Someone with more established checking resources might have a more diverse payment plan without risk.
   - RPN: {checking_status label_encode other_payment_plans label_encode cross}

These features aim to enhance the understanding of financial risk and stability, potentially improving the prediction of credit approvals.

2025-09-22 02:12:02,154 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, consider utilizing the operators and the existing features in the dataset to craft new meaningful features. The aim is to provide deeper insights into creditworthiness and predictability. Here’s the reasoning and creation of three new features using Reverse Polish Notation:

1. Feature 1: Interaction of Personal Status and Residence Since with Credit History  
   Reasoning: The combination of personal status and how long the person has lived at their current residence can provide insights into their stability and lifestyle, potentially correlating with credit reliability. When combined with credit history, it could further reveal reliability in repaying loans.  
   RPN: {personal_status residence_since cross credit_history label_encode cross}

2. Feature 2: Normalized Interaction between Credit Amount and Job Status  
   Reasoning: The ratio between the requested credit amount and the job status can provide a perspective on the applicant's ability to repay the loan based on their employment situation. Normalizing this ratio could highlight discrepancies in credit request versus the employment capacity.  
   RPN: {credit_amount job label_encode ratio}

3. Feature 3: Composite Feature Combining Purpose and Checking Status with Duration  
   Reasoning: The purpose for which the credit is requested, combined with their current checking status and the duration of credit, might reveal the intent and affordability of the applicant and shed light on the risk associated with lending. This composite feature could improve the understanding of their credit motivation relative to their financial status.  
   RPN: {purpose label_encode cross checking_status label_encode cross duration plus}

2025-09-22 02:12:07,989 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three new features that could be useful for improving the model's performance, explained along with their corresponding Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):

1. Feature 1: Effect of Checking Status on Credit Duration and Amount  
   - Reasoning: Understanding the interaction between checking account status and both credit duration and credit amount can reveal insights into financial management behavior. Applicants with more stable checking account statuses might handle longer durations and larger credit amounts differently than those with less stable statuses.
   - RPN: {credit_amount duration multiply checking_status_label_encode cross}

2. Feature 2: Ratio of Personal Status to Employment Times Residence Stability  
   - Reasoning: Combining personal status and employment information with how long an applicant has been residing in their current location could indicate stability and reliability. This feature helps to assess how life stability influences creditworthiness.
   - RPN: {personal_status_employment_cross residence_since cross ratio}

3. Feature 3: Credit Amount Adjusted by Credit History Quality  
   - Reasoning: Adjusting the credit amount by encoding and dividing by the credit history quality provides a normalized measure of the applicant's borrowing relative to their past behavior. This can highlight how reasonable the credit request is considering their credit history.
   - RPN: {credit_amount credit_history label_encode divide}

These newly engineered features are designed to capture potential interactions and relationships that were not evident with the initial set of features, thereby assisting in a more nuanced understanding of each applicant’s creditworthiness.

2025-09-22 02:12:13,027 - INFO - LLM Output: To create new features that may improve the model's performance, we can focus on leveraging both combinations of existing features and transformations that provide additional insights into the applicant's financial profile.

1. Credit Stability via History and Duration: 
   - Idea: An interaction between credit history and the length of credit might reveal the borrower's stability and historical reliability in handling long-term financial commitments. 
   - RPN: {credit_history label_encode duration divide log}

2. Employment Influence on Financial Activity: 
   - Idea: Combining social status and employment information with duration should give insights into the borrowed credit's stability and the duration of the credit, which might reveal the user's readiness for credit and could be pivotal in understanding long-term financial commitments.
   - RPN: {personal_status label_encode employment label_encode multiply duration log}

3. Financial Product Familiarity and Purpose Relationship: 
   - Idea: This construct evaluates the relationship between the applicant's purpose for taking credit and their financial history, giving insights into their capability for handling various financial products depending on different objectives.
   - RPN: {purpose label_encode credit_history label_encode cross}

These features are designed to encapsulate the user's financial behavior, history, and current financial interactions, thus potentially improving the model's ability to predict creditworthiness more accurately.

2025-09-22 02:12:18,316 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that could potentially improve the prediction model's performance, I'll consider utilizing existing features while keeping in mind the importance of capturing interactions between different features, especially those related to financial stability and personal characteristics. The features will aim to offer insights into creditworthiness from different angles:

1. Credit Amount to Duration and Purpose Weight: This feature aims to understand the credit amount requested in relation to the duration and adjusted by the purpose-associated weight, which might indicate underlying risk levels associated with different purposes.
   - RPN: {credit_amount duration divide purpose label_encode multiply}

2. Employment and Checking Account Status Interaction: This feature aims to combine employment stability with checking account status to provide insight into financial stability.
   - RPN: {job label_encode employment duration label_encode cross checking_status label_encode cross}

3. Personal Status and Residence Duration Effect: This feature examines the stability of residence in connection with personal status, offering another layer of social stability and reliability criteria potentially influencing credit decisions.
   - RPN: {personal_status label_encode residence_since multiply}

These RPN expressions will encode these interactions and adjustments, potentially leading to a better understanding of the applicant's ability and reliability in repaying a loan, each contributing a unique perspective based on financial, personal, and temporal factors.

2025-09-22 02:12:23,737 - INFO - LLM Output: Given the information provided and the goal of enhancing the downstream model's performance with new features, here are three new feature ideas with corresponding reasoning and RPN expressions:

1. Personal Financial Stability Score:
   - Reasoning: This feature synthesizes an individual's checking status and job type to capture both immediate financial condition and longer-term employment security. These are key indicators that can help assess creditworthiness through spending power and earning stability.
   - RPN: {checking_status label_encode job label_encode plus}

2. Credit-to-Income Ratio Normalized by Duration:
   - Reasoning: This feature examines the relationship between the applicant's requested credit amount and potential income (derived from employment and personal status), normalized over the loan's duration. This gives an indication of how burdensome the credit amount may be given the applicant's financial profile.
   - RPN: {credit_amount job label_encode divide duration divide}

3. Aggregated Credit History and Personal Status Impact:
   - Reasoning: This feature combines credit history with personal status and employment, aiming to bring out more insights related to an applicant's past credit behavior and personal responsibilities, and how these could impact their future credit reliability.
   - RPN: {credit_history label_encode personal_status label_encode cross employment duration label_encode cross}

These features were created by observing common patterns in existing examples and employing transformations to synthesize useful applicant profile metrics that could enhance predictive models in credit assessment.

2025-09-22 02:12:28,594 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, we need to create new features that effectively capture interactions and patterns between existing features. Here are three proposed new features with the reasoning:

1. Ratio of Duration to Checking Status with Credit History Influence:
   - This feature examines the relationship between the duration of the credit request, checking account status, and how credit history influences this. Duration is a key factor for repayment capacity, and its interaction with checking status, influenced by credit history, might reveal crucial insights.
   - RPN: {duration checking_status label_encode ratio credit_history label_encode groupbythenmean multiply}

2. Impact of Personal Status and Residence Stability on Credit Amount:
   - By examining personal status in conjunction with residence stability and relating this to the credit amount, we can gauge how lifestyle choices and stability affect financial commitments. This composite feature might highlight applicants ready for credit due to stable and supportive environments.
   - RPN: {personal_status label_encode residence_since multiply credit_amount ratio}

3. Normalized Job Value with Credit History Indicator:
   - This feature examines job categorization's effect on credit evaluation, normalized by a credit history indicator. It aims to uncover how job classification might impact creditworthiness alongside historical credit behaviors. High qualification jobs might exhibit lower risk and can be captured effectively through normalization with credit history.
   - RPN: {job label_encode credit_history label_encode ratio}

These features attempt to encapsulate interactions and normalizations that could provide deeper insight into the applicant's credit behavior and reliability, potentially enhancing model prediction accuracy.
