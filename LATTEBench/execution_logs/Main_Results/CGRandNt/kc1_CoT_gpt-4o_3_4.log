2025-09-22 10:29:16,585 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating new features for software defect prediction can significantly enhance the predictive power of the model. Given the context of the problem and the features provided, here are three new features engineered to improve model performance:

1. Cyclomatic Complexity Ratio: Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) conveys how complex a piece of code is. We create a ratio of cyclomatic complexity to lines of code to obtain a normalized measure of complexity per line, which might correlate better with defects.

   RPN: {v(g) loc divide}

2. Halstead Complexity Measure: Halstead metrics (v, l, d) are related to the cognitive complexity of the code. Combining them to form a composite score might capture the intricacy of the code more effectively than standalone features. Using a weighted sum, where volume (v) is the base, length (l) is a multiplying factor, and difficulty (d) adjusts this further, could highlight more complex areas prone to defects.

   RPN: {v l multiply d multiply}

3. Comment Density: High density of comments relative to the actual code may indicate well-documented code that could potentially be less prone to defects. This feature is calculated as the number of lines of comment (lOComment) divided by the sum of lines of code (lOCode) and lines of comments (lOComment).

   RPN: {lOComment lOCode lOComment plus divide}

These three engineered features aim to capture different dimensions of code complexity and documentation, which could be beneficial for identifying defect-prone areas in the software modules.

2025-09-22 10:29:23,991 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating new features through feature engineering can significantly enhance the predictive power of models in software defect prediction tasks. Here are three newly engineered features using the provided operators and features. The rationale involves capturing potential interactions and transformations that might reveal underlying patterns associated with software defects:

1. Complexity and Size Interaction: Multiplying Cyclomatic Complexity (v(g)) by LOC (loc) can give a composite measure of how complex larger code sections are, which might be prone to defects.
   - RPN: v(g) loc multiply

2. Normalized Halstead Effort: Apply a logarithmic transformation to the Halstead effort (e) after normalizing it with the total operators and operands. This transformation could help illustrate how changes in program effort correlate to defects after scaling down large values.
   - RPN: e total_Op total_Opnd plus divide log

3. Interaction Between Branch Count and Operators: Combining branch count and unique operators using multiplication can help capture the complexity added by branching and operation diversity, potentially linked to defect occurrence.
   - RPN: branchCount uniq_Op multiply

Output:

2025-09-22 10:29:31,931 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance for software defect prediction, we can create new features by leveraging mathematical operations and domain-specific knowledge. Here's my reasoning for generating 3 new features:

1. Feature 1: Code Complexity Indicator
   - Combining line count (loc) with cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) helps capture the relationship between the size and complexity of the code. Taking the log of this combination can help normalize their impact.
   - RPN: {loc v(g) multiply log}

2. Feature 2: Efficiency and Difficulty Ratio
   - Given Halstead's measures, combining 'effort' (e) and 'difficulty' (d) captures coding efficiency. Taking their ratio can indicate how efficiently the code is written as a function of its difficulty.
   - RPN: {e d divide}

3. Feature 3: Size-to-Comment Ratio
   - The ratio of the total line count (lOCode) to the number of lines of comments (lOComment) can indicate how well-documented a module is considering its size. This might help in identifying defects due to a lack of documentation in code.
   - RPN: {lOCode lOComment divide}

Output:
 
{loc v(g) multiply log, e d divide, lOCode lOComment divide}
 

These features aim to capture various aspects of code quality and potential defect indicators through complexity, documentation, and efficiency measures.

2025-09-22 10:29:42,550 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the prediction accuracy of software defect detection using feature engineering, we need to create features that can reveal new patterns or enhance existing ones. Considering this task and the available operators, let's create three new features using some reasonable hypotheses.

### Key Considerations:
1. Complexity Interactions: Software complexity can be reflected through various measures (like cyclomatic complexity, volume, and difficulty). Combining these could provide better insights into potential defects.
2. Code Density Characteristics: Lines of code, comments, and blank lines interactions might highlight density-related defects (e.g., less commenting might correlate with more defects due to less documentation).
3. Dynamic Range of Features: Using statistical transformation like z-score can help normalize across distributions, identifying outliers or anomalies more easily.

### Proposed New Features:

1. Complexity-Density Interaction:
   - Goal: Capture the relationship between cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and effective lines of code (loc).
   - Hypothesis: High complexity with low code density can be a critical indicator of defects.
   - RPN: v(g) loc multiply zscore
   - Reasoning: Multiplying complexity by lines of code and then normalizing allows for comparison across modules with varying sizes and complexities.

2. Density-Adjustment via Comments:
   - Goal: Use the density of code and comment interaction to identify under-documented yet complex modules.
   - Hypothesis: Modules with high density but low code documentation have higher defect rates.
   - RPN: loc lOComment add 1 constant divide
   - Reasoning: Using reciprocal (inverse) transforms emphasizes modules with low documentation (zero would yield infinite, so adding a constant avoids division by zero).

3. Effort Intensity Normalization:
   - Goal: Examine the normalized effort required (e) considering effort variability across modules.
   - Hypothesis: Outliers in effort could correlate with defects as they might indicate overly complex or resource-intensive software components.
   - RPN: e zscore
   - Reasoning: Normalizing effort using z-score helps in understanding how much relative effort is different from average, helping detect exceptionally high efforts.

2025-09-22 10:29:49,575 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that could improve the downstream model's performance in predicting software defects, let's consider the nature and distribution of the existing features. We'll aim to capture more complex interactions and non-linear relationships among the features that might be associated with software defects.

1. Combining Complexity Metrics:
   Cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) measures the code's control flow complexity, while essential complexity (ev(g)) and design complexity (iv(g)) provide additional views on the module's complexity. A combined metric could provide a more holistic view of the code's complexity related to defects.
   - RPN Expression: {v(g) ev(g) iv(g) plus plus sqrt}

2. Feature Interaction via Ratio:
   The ratio of operators to operands can be indicative of how the code is structured, which might relate to defect likelihood. Comparing unique operators (uniq_Op) to total operands (total_Opnd) may give insights into the balance and complexity of operations within the code.
   - RPN Expression: {uniq_Op total_Opnd ratio log}

3. Temporal and Effort-based Feature:
   The relationship between Halstead's effort (e) and time estimator (t) might indicate how complex and time-consuming the module is expected to be, possibly correlating more with defects.
   - RPN Expression: {e t ratio sigmoid}

These transformations aim to enhance the data set by providing insightful and non-linear perspectives of the existing information, potentially capturing interactions and relationships that standard linear models may not fully exploit.

Answer: 1.0


Operators:
square, sqrt, cosine, sine, tangent, exp, cube, log, reciprocal, sigmoid, abs, negate, zscore, minmax, rank, bin, one_hot, label_encode, extract_time, is_weekend, elapsed_time, plus, subtract, multiply, divide, mod, equal, greater, less, max, min, cross, concat, ratio, diff, bin
rolling_mean, lag, cumsum, groupbythenmean, groupbythenmin, groupbythenmax, groupbythenmedian, groupbythenstd, groupbythenrank, target_encoding

These are the current top new features and their score (accuracy gain):
top 1: new features = {v(g) ev(g) iv(g) plus plus sqrt}, score = 0.007109004739336511

2025-09-22 10:29:57,623 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve the downstream model's performance, I will generate three new features using the given operators and the existing features. The purpose of these transformations is to explore non-linear relationships, interactions, and representations that could enhance the understanding or predictive power related to software defects. These transformations are based on established patterns or potential hidden relationships in the dataset:

1. Feature 1: Code Complexity Interaction: Focus on the interaction between cyclomatic complexity (v(g)), essential complexity (ev(g)), and design complexity (iv(g)). Since central tendencies and interactions can have predictive potential, I will further manipulate the top-performing feature (v(g) ev(g) iv(g) plus plus sqrt) and apply a squared transformation:

   RPN: {v(g) ev(g) iv(g) plus plus sqrt square}

2. Feature 2: Operators to Operands Ratio Enhanced: This feature will examine how the balance of total operators (total_Op) and total operands (total_Opnd) affects software quality, emphasizing potential non-linear relationships by applying a logarithmic transformation:

   RPN: {total_Op total_Opnd ratio log}

3. Feature 3: Modified Program Length as Complexity Indicator: Halstead's 'program length' (l) can provide insights into code complexity. Applying a negative reciprocal transformation might highlight how decreases in program length inversely relate to complexity:

   RPN: {l reciprocal negate}

These transformations leverage exploratory data transformations known to uncover non-intuitive insights that can potentially improve model performance by highlighting intrinsic patterns or outliers within the more complex space of interactions between these fundamental software metrics.

2025-09-22 10:30:08,395 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features that may provide better predictions for the software defect prediction task, we should focus on understanding interactions between the features, especially those related to code complexity and quality. Given the information about existing top-performing features, we can consider the following new feature generation strategies:

1. Enhancing Feature Interactions: Given that the combination of cyclomatic complexity metrics (v(g), ev(g), iv(g)) with mathematical operations like plus and sqrt offered some improvements, it is logical to explore further interactions with other related features like branchCount and loc. This could provide insights into the real-world scenario where an increase in complexity or line count often correlates with defects.

2. Feature Scaling and Transformation: Looking at the ranges and distributions of the features, there is a potential benefit in scaling or transforming features like loc, v(g), and branchCount using techniques such as z-score and logarithmic transformations. This can help normalize skewed distributions, making patterns more detectable by models.

3. Interaction with Code Volume and Difficulty: The Halstead metrics (volume v and difficulty d) are essential indicators of the cognitive complexity of code. Introducing interactions between these metrics and cyclomatic complexity through transformations could highlight potential defect-inducing patterns.

Considering these strategies, here are three new features in Reverse Polish Notation:

1. Interaction of Cyclomatic Complexity Metrics with Logarithmic Transformation:
   - Combining cyclomatic complexity (v(g), ev(g), iv(g)), and branchCount with log transformation to capture high-complexity regions in code.
   - RPN: {v(g) ev(g) iv(g) plus plus branchCount plus log}

2. Ratio of Operators to Complexity with Z-score Transformation:
   - Using total operators and operands with cyclomatic complexity measures, transformed with z-score, to examine normalized impact.
   - RPN: {total_Op total_Opnd plus v(g) ev(g) iv(g) plus plus divide zscore}

3. Combination of Lines of Code with Effort and Difficulty with Logarithmic Transformation:
   - Capturing the interaction of lines of code, effort, and difficulty with logarithmic transformation, highlighting regions of code that might be labor-intensive and error-prone.
   - RPN: {loc e d multiply log}

These feature transformations aim to enhance the model by uncovering latent patterns and improving feature scale homogeneity, leading to potentially better defect predictions.

2025-09-22 10:30:16,784 - INFO - LLM Output: To generate new features for improving the prediction performance of the downstream task of software defect prediction, we should consider interactions, transformations, and aggregations that might capture hidden patterns in the data. Given the existing context and operators, here are three proposed features with their reasoning and corresponding RPN expressions:

1. Feature: Complexity and Effort Interaction
   - Reasoning: The combination of cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and effort (e) can provide insights into whether modules with higher complexity demand more effort, potentially leading to defects. Using multiplication with square and logarithmic transformations can emphasize non-linearity in this interaction.
   - RPN: {v(g) e multiply log}

2. Feature: Halstead Volume to Line Count Ratio Enhanced
   - Reasoning: The ratio of Halstead volume (v) to the line count of code (loc) is a direct measure of density or information per line. Squaring the volume can enhance differences in density, potentially correlating with defect density.
   - RPN: {v v multiply loc divide}

3. Feature: Cyclomatic and Essential Complexity Interaction
   - Reasoning: Understanding the relationship between cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and essential complexity (ev(g)) can yield insights into the true complexity of navigating the code. A cube transformation highlights interactions that might be indicative of defect-prone code.
   - RPN: {v(g) ev(g) cube multiply}

These new features aim to uncover and leverage complex interactions and transformations based on the inherent characteristics of software metrics to improve defect prediction accuracy.

2025-09-22 10:30:25,513 - INFO - LLM Output: Creating new features can help the predictive model by capturing more nuanced interactions or patterns within the data. Given the current features and past feature scores, the goal is to explore meaningful transformations that might yield a better model performance. Here are three proposed new features:

1. Feature 1: Cyclomatic Complexity and Effort Interaction  
   This feature explores the interaction between cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and effort (e). The thought is that modules with higher complexity and effort may be more prone to defects. The square root transformation helps to stabilize the variance.
   - RPN: {v(g) e multiply sqrt}

2. Feature 2: Logarithm of Volume to Intelligence Ratio  
   By taking the ratio of Halstead's volume (v) to intelligence (i) and applying a logarithm transformation, we can capture how efficiently the code's intelligence addresses the volume. Modules with lower intelligence for a given volume could indicate a poorer design, potentially leading to defects.
   - RPN: {v i divide log}

3. Feature 3: Normalized Difficulty Interaction  
   This feature uses difficulty (d) normalized by cyclomatic complexity (v(g)) and essential complexity (ev(g)). This highlights how the difficulty is balanced against different types of complexity, pointing to potential issues in modules that have high difficulty but low complexity, or vice versa. The reciprocal transformation helps to manage very small values that could inflate downstream model coefficients unduly.
   - RPN: {d v(g) divide ev(g) divide reciprocal}

These features leverage interaction and transformation operators to capture complex relationships that might be predictive of defects within the software modules.

2025-09-22 10:30:34,663 - INFO - LLM Output: To create new features that might improve the downstream model's performance, we need to consider interactions and transformations of existing features that capture essential characteristics of software defects. Here's a brief reasoning and the proposed new features:

1. Feature Interaction through Ratios or Combinations: Creating features that capture the relationships and interactions between different code metrics can highlight patterns related to defects. For example, understanding the balance between complexity, code volume, and code length can provide insights into code maintainability and defect probability.
  
2. Non-linear Transformations: Applying non-linear transformations like logarithms can stabilize variance and make the patterns more apparent to a machine learning model.

3. Complexity and Effort Relationships: Since complexity and development effort are key in defect predictability, interactions between related features can be useful.

Here are three proposed new features in RPN format:

1. Complexity Interaction Feature: Create a feature that combines the McCabe-related complexity metrics.
   - RPN: {v(g) ev(g) iv(g) plus sqrt} 
   - This captures an aggregate complexity measure, accentuating cases where high complexity is spread across different aspects.

2. Effort-Volume Interaction Feature: A feature capturing interaction between Halstead's effort and volume.
   - RPN: {e v multiply log} 
   - This highlights how effort scales with code volume, potentially uncovering latent defect proneness due to inefficient coding practices.

3. Operator-Operand Balance Feature: Investigate the relationship between total operators and operands.
   - RPN: {total_Op total_Opnd ratio} 
   - Examining the ratio of operators to operands can shed light on the coding style and complexity, helping identify modules with higher risk of defects.

Overall, these features aim to provide deeper insights into software complexity, effort, and structural balance, which are pivotal in predicting defects in the code.
