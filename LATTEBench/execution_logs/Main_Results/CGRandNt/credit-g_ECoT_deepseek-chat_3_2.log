credit_amount duration multiply log, 
checking_status credit_history cross,

}

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply log - Creates a feature representing the log of total credit obligation (amount * duration), which captures the overall financial commitment. Log transformation helps handle skewness and makes the feature more normally distributed.

2. checking_status credit_history cross - Combines checking account status with credit history, which are both important categorical indicators of financial stability. Their interaction may reveal patterns that individual features miss.

3. savings_status credit_amount groupbythenmean - Calculates the average credit amount for each savings status category. This creates a target-encoding-like feature that captures how different savings levels correlate with typical loan sizes, which could be predictive of creditworthiness.

2025-09-02 10:35:22,926 - INFO - LLM Output: {
credit_amount duration multiply credit_amount duration subtract ratio, 
checking_status credit_history cross, 
age employment label_encode multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply credit_amount duration subtract ratio: 
   - This creates an interaction feature (credit_amount * duration) and a ratio feature ((credit_amount - duration)/duration). 
   - These capture the relationship between loan amount and repayment period, which is crucial for credit risk assessment.
   - The ratio helps normalize the credit amount by duration, creating a monthly burden metric.

2. checking_status credit_history cross:
   - Crosses two important categorical features that both relate to financial reliability.
   - Checking account status and credit history together provide a more nuanced view of the applicant's financial behavior.
   - This creates interaction terms that may reveal patterns not captured by the individual features alone.

3. age employment label_encode multiply:
   - Converts employment (categorical) to numerical via label encoding, then multiplies by age.
   - This creates a feature that represents career maturity - combining age with employment stability.
   - Older applicants with stable employment (higher employment category values) get higher scores, which aligns with credit risk assessment principles.

Reasoning:
1. credit_amount duration multiply log: Creates a combined measure of credit burden (amount per month) and applies log to handle skew. This captures the total financial commitment relative to loan duration.

2. checking_status credit_history cross: Crosses two important financial stability indicators. The combination of checking account status and credit history likely has strong predictive power for credit approval decisions.

3. age credit_amount ratio: Creates a normalized feature that represents credit amount relative to age. Younger applicants with large credit amounts might be riskier, while older applicants might be more established and better candidates.

Reasoning:
1. duration credit_amount multiply log - Creates a combined measure of credit burden (duration * amount) which is a strong risk indicator, then applies log to handle skewness. This captures both the size and repayment period of the loan.

2. checking_status credit_history cross - Combines two important categorical features that both relate to financial reliability. The interaction between checking account status and credit history may reveal patterns that individual features miss.

3. age duration multiply credit_amount divide - Creates a ratio that represents the loan burden relative to age-adjusted repayment capacity. Younger applicants with long durations relative to loan amount might have different risk profiles than older applicants with similar ratios.
