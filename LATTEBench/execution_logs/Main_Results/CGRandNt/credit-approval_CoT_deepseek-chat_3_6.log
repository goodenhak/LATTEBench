Age Debt ratio log, 
Industry Income groupbythenmean, 
YearsEmployed Employed cross
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: The ratio of Age to Debt could capture financial responsibility relative to life stage. Taking the log helps normalize the distribution and handle extreme values, which is important given Debt's scaled nature and Age's wide range.

2. Industry Income groupbythenmean: Different industries have different income patterns. Grouping by Industry and calculating mean Income creates a feature that captures industry-specific income benchmarks, which could be highly predictive of credit card approval success.

3. YearsEmployed Employed cross: The interaction between years employed and employment status could be highly informative. Those with many years employed AND currently employed are likely much better candidates than those with many years employed but currently unemployed, or those with few years employed but currently employed.

YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore multiply
}

Reasoning:
1. Age Debt ratio log: The ratio of Age to Debt could capture the ability to manage debt relative to life experience. Taking the log normalizes the distribution and handles extreme values, which is important given Debt's high std (4.93) and Income's extreme range (0-100k).

2. Industry Income groupbythenmean: Industry is categorical and Income has extreme variance (std=5395). Grouping by Industry and taking mean Income creates a feature that represents average income by sector, which likely correlates with credit card approval success (e.g., Financials vs Education sectors).

3. YearsEmployed Employed multiply CreditScore multiply: This creates an interaction feature that combines employment stability (YearsEmployed), current employment status (Employed), and creditworthiness (CreditScore). The product amplifies the signal when all three are favorable (e.g., long-employed, currently employed person with good credit).

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed plus log: Combines age and years employed to create a measure of total life experience that might correlate with creditworthiness. The log transformation helps normalize the distribution.

2. Industry Income groupbythenmean CreditScore multiply: Enhances the existing groupbythenmean feature by interacting it with credit score, creating a feature that captures both industry income potential and individual credit behavior.

3. PriorDefault Employed multiply CreditScore multiply: Creates a triple interaction term that identifies individuals who have prior defaults but are currently employed with good credit scores - a potentially high-risk but interesting segment for prediction.

Age YearsEmployed multiply Debt divide log, 
Industry YearsEmployed groupbythenmean Employed multiply, 
CreditScore PriorDefault subtract Employed multiply sigmoid
}

Reasoning:
1. Age YearsEmployed multiply Debt divide log: This creates a comprehensive financial stability metric by combining age (experience), years employed (job stability), and debt (financial burden). The log transformation helps normalize the distribution and handle outliers.

2. Industry YearsEmployed groupbythenmean Employed multiply: This calculates the average years employed per industry and multiplies by employment status, creating a feature that captures industry-specific employment stability weighted by current employment status.

3. CreditScore PriorDefault subtract Employed multiply sigmoid: This creates a risk assessment feature by subtracting prior defaults from credit score (offsetting good credit with bad history), multiplying by employment status (employed people are lower risk), and applying sigmoid to bound the output between 0-1 for better model interpretation.
