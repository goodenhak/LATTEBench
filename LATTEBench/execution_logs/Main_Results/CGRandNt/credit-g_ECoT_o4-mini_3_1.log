2025-09-02 10:49:25,376 - INFO - LLM Output: Reasoning:
1. A log‐transformed ratio of credit amount to duration (log(credit_amount/duration)) highlights relative monthly burden and stabilizes skew.
2. The difference between an applicant’s loan duration and the average duration for that purpose (duration – mean_duration_by_purpose) captures atypical repayment terms.
3. Binning age into 5 groups and label‐encoding (age 5‐bin) allows the model to learn non‐linear age effects.

1. The core feature “credit_amount_duration_divide_log_purpose_duration_groupbythenmean_duration_subtract_multiply” is highly skewed and on a different scale than other features; applying a z-score standardization can help the model converge faster and treat this feature more uniformly.
2. Dividing this core feature by the “purpose_credit_history_cross_target_encoding” captures an interaction effect between credit amount dynamics and the applicant’s repayment history, potentially revealing relative risk.
3. Computing the mean of the core feature by “savings_status” groups adds a group-level summary that can highlight how an applicant’s saving behavior correlates with their credit-amount/duration profile.

2025-09-02 10:51:01,261 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three candidate features, along with the intuition for each:

1. Scale the standardized “credit‐amount×duration” feature by how good the applicant’s past history is.  
   – If someone has a high z‐score on repayment (i.e. heavy credit usage over duration) but also a very strong credit history, that interaction may weigh differently than for someone with a weak history.  

2. Capture the typical “credit‐amount×duration” behavior within each savings‐bucket.  
   – Different savings‐status groups (no savings, small, medium, large) may systematically take different kinds of loans; using the group mean captures this baseline.  

3. Model the interaction between foreign‐worker status and savings bucket on loan intensity.  
   – Some combinations of “foreign‐worker=yes/no” × “savings‐status” may be especially risky or safe; multiplying that encoded interaction with the raw “credit‐amount×duration” magnifies those patterns.  

RPN expressions for these three features:

1. Capture non-linear interactions between two categorical fields by crossing savings status with foreign-worker flag, then label-encoding the result.  
2. Leverage group-level behavior of a key numeric signal by taking the mean of the “credit_amount_duration_divide_log_…” feature within each foreign-worker group.  
3. Model relative importance of purpose-based credit history vs. checking/savings strength by forming their ratio and log-transforming it to stabilize variance.

2025-09-02 10:53:38,302 - INFO - LLM Output: Here are three candidate features, with the intuition for each:

1. “zscore × purpose‐history”: multiplying the z‐scored credit‐amount‐duration signal by the target‐encoded purpose/credit‐history captures an interaction between how unusual the applicant’s amount‐duration ratio is and their historical repayment performance.  
2. “log(checking_savings_cross ÷ amount‐duration)”: taking the log of the ratio between the checking/savings cross‐label and the credit‐amount‐duration signal both normalizes extreme values and ties the client’s account standing directly to their loan amplitude.  
3. “group mean by savings_status”: computing the average credit‐amount‐duration signal within each savings_status segment embeds segment‐level behavior (e.g. how high‐risk is “<100” vs “>=1000”) back into each row.

RPN expressions for these three features:
