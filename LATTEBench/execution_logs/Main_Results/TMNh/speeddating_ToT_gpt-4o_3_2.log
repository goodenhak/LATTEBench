You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

2025-10-27 17:32:24,061 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- decision_o: * decision_o: Decision of partner at night of event. (categorical), categories = [b'1', b'0']
- decision: * decision: Decision at night of event. (categorical), categories = [b'1', b'0']

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

2025-10-27 17:32:55,291 - INFO - thoughts: You are an expert datascientist working to improve predictions. 
You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:
- decision_o: * decision_o: Decision of partner at night of event. (categorical), categories = [b'1', b'0']

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
