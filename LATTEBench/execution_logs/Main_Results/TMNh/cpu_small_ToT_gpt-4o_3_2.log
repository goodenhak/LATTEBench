You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very cpu-bound programs. Predict the portion of time that cpus run in user mode from all attributes.

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.

The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very cpu-bound programs. Predict the portion of time that cpus run in user mode from all attributes.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
The data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users would typically be doing a large variety of tasks ranging from accessing the internet, editing files or running very cpu-bound programs. Predict the portion of time that cpus run in user mode from all attributes.
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.
