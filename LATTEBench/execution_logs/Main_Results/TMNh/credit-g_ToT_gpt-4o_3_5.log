You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Possible next three steps:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion:

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:

- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [business, new car, used car, education, furniture/equipment, radio/tv, other, repairs, domestic appliance, retraining]
- own_telephone: Telephone (categorical), categories = [yes, none]

complete the task without making the same mistakes as before. Be simple, direct, and intuitive.
The possible next three step:

Instructions:
1. Use '<>' for new_feature_name, operator, feature1, feature2 and new_feature_description, NO space or \ between. Each line has only one operator.
2. DO NOT divide, plus or subtract categorical_feature, use cross, concat or type conversion.
3. Type Conversion: 
    1. <numerical_feature><label_encode><categorical_feature>
    2. <categorical_feature><bin><numerical_feature>
4. The first parameter of the groupbythen operator is the grouping key.
                                 
Output Format:
1. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><feature2><new_feature_description>
2. <new_feature_name><operator><feature1><new_feature_description>
3. ...
                                 
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE.

You perform feature engineering that generate additional columns that are useful for a downstream task.

Task:
Does this person receive a credit? Yes or no?
First, produce 3 possible next steps to generate features using the operations, trying to improve the downstream model's performance. Explain the reasoning behind each step.

Features:

- installment_commitment: Installment rate in percentage of disposable income (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 2.0, Median = 3.0, Q3 = 4.0, Mean = 2.9617, Std = 1.1086
- savings_status: Status of savings account/bonds, in Deutsche Mark. (categorical), categories = [<100, >=1000, no known savings, 100<=X<500, 500<=X<1000]
- credit_purpose_cross: Combine credit history with purpose to capture successful or unsuccessful borrowing patterns for specific purposes (categorical), categories = [existing paid_business, existing paid_new car, ..., no credits/all paid_radio/tv]
- age: Age in years (numerical), range = [19, 74], Q1 = 27.0, Median = 33.5, Q3 = 42.0, Mean = 35.8917, Std = 11.4752
- num_dependents: Number of people being liable to provide maintenance for (numerical), range = [1, 2], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 1.0, Mean = 1.1700, Std = 0.3759
- personal_status: Personal status (married, single,...) and sex (categorical), categories = [male single, female div/dep/mar, male div/sep, male mar/wid]
- housing: Housing (rent, own,...) (categorical), categories = [own, for free, rent]
- existing_credits: Number of existing credits at this bank (numerical), range = [1, 4], Q1 = 1.0, Median = 1.0, Q3 = 2.0, Mean = 1.3900, Std = 0.5875
- other_parties: Other debtors / guarantors (categorical), categories = [none, guarantor, co applicant]
- other_payment_plans: Other installment plans (banks, stores) (categorical), categories = [stores, none, bank]
- job: Job (categorical), categories = [skilled, unemp/unskilled non res, unskilled resident, high qualif/self emp/mgmt]
- credit_history: Credit history (categorical), categories = [existing paid, critical/other existing credit, no credits/all paid, all paid, delayed previously]
- purpose: Purpose of the credit (categorical), categories = [business, new car, used car, education, furniture/equipment, radio/tv, other, repairs, domestic appliance, retraining]
- own_telephone: Telephone (categorical), categories = [yes, none]
