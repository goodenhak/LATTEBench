python
# combined_io

# Usefulness: This feature captures the overall I/O activity, which could impact CPU usage. Higher I/O might indicate more CPU involvement.
df['combined_io'] = df['lread'] + df['lwrite']
end

python
# call_ratio
# Ratio of system read calls to write calls.
# Usefulness: This feature provides insight into the balance between reading and writing operations, showing if the workload is read or write-heavy.
df['call_ratio'] = df['sread'] / (df['swrite'] + 1)  # Adding 1 to avoid division by zero.
end

python
# exec_fork_ratio
# Ratio of exec calls to fork calls to assess process spawning.
# Usefulness: This feature helps to understand process creation behavior, given that both exec and fork are related to spawning processes.
df['exec_fork_ratio'] = df['exec'] / (df['fork'] + 1)  # Adding 1 to prevent division by zero.
end

python
# cpu_load
# The product of the process run queue size and the number of system calls.
# Usefulness: This feature aims to capture the load on the CPU, given that both the number of processes waiting and the number of system calls contribute to CPU usage.
df['cpu_load'] = df['runqsz'] * df['scall']
end

python
# mem_utilization
# Calculates the ratio of used memory to total memory (using a constant for total system memory).
# Usefulness: Memory usage gives context to CPU availability for processing tasks, crucial for a multi-user environment.
total_memory = 8192  # Assuming a constant total memory, this value might be adjusted based on domain knowledge.
df['mem_utilization'] = 1 - (df['freemem'] / total_memory)
end

python
# swap_usage
# Proportion of disk blocks used for swapping.
# Usefulness: Indicates how much virtual memory swapping is happening, which might impact CPU performance, as frequent swapping can denote memory pressure.
total_swap = 2161779  # Maximum possible swap from features
df['swap_usage'] = 1 - (df['freeswap'] / total_swap)
end

python
# Explanation why the column runqsz is dropped
# While 'runqsz' provides insight into the number of processes queued, this feature in isolation might not be as informative as when combined with other features. The 'cpu_load' feature may capture more relevant information.
df.drop(columns=['runqsz'], inplace=True)

These new features are aimed at capturing interaction effects and ratios between existing attributes, which often reveal patterns not discernible with individual features alone.
