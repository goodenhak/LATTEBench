The dataset has many features; complex models might overfit. Identifying features with limited variance or relevance could help simplify the model.

python
# Explanation why the column nN-N is dropped
# The number of N hydrazines is mostly zero (low mean and very low standard deviation, the majority being zero), 
# indicating limited variance and likely negligible effect on the predictive variability. Thus, it could be deprecated for simplicity.

2025-12-29 15:59:12,397 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions of chemical biodegradability based on the given molecular descriptors, we can create some additional features that capture interactions or distributions across existing features. Here's a set of feature-engineered columns and any dropped columns:

python
# SpMax_L_Squared
# Square of the leading eigenvalue from the Laplace matrix.
# Usefulness: Highlights the stronger interactions or influences a chemical structure might have since eigenvalues often link with stability properties in chemical graph theory.
df['SpMax_L_Squared'] = df['SpMax_L']  2

# J_Dz_e_Sqrt
# Square root of Balaban-like index from Barysz matrix weighted by Sanderson electronegativity.
# Usefulness: Helps in normalizing effects of this index to better handle the distribution, possibly making coefficients in linear models more interpretable.
df['J_Dz_e_Sqrt'] = df['J_Dz(e)'].apply(np.sqrt)

# nHM_Log
# Log transformation of the number of heavy atoms.
# Usefulness: Reduces skewness and thus the impact of outliers since heavy atoms count can have a peak influence on molecule properties in large numbers.
df['nHM_Log'] = np.log1p(df['nHM'])

# C_Per_O
# Ratio of C% to the number of oxygen atoms.
# Usefulness: Examining the balance of carbon versus oxygen since oxygen might play a role in chemical reactions and interactions.
df['C_Per_O'] = df['C%'] / (df['nO'] + 1e-5)

# nCb_minus_F01_NN
# Difference between number of substituted benzene C(sp2) and frequency of N-N at topological distance 1.
# Usefulness: Indicator of aromatic modifications versus potential nitrogen bonding impacts.
df['nCb_minus_F01_NN'] = df['nCb-'] - df['F01[N-N]']

# Span_ratio
# Ratio of SpMax_L and SpMax_A.
# Usefulness: Provides a measure of relative structural complexity or stability between the two different matrix-based descriptors.
df['Span_ratio'] = df['SpMax_L'] / (df['SpMax_A'] + 1e-5)

# Oxygen_Content_Bin
# Binning of number of oxygen atoms into categories.
# Usefulness: Grouping simplifies this feature to categorical counterparts enabling nonlinear model capture naturally or direct comparison.
df['Oxygen_Content_Bin'] = pd.cut(df['nO'], bins=[-1, 0, 2, 5, 12], labels=['None', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'])

# SdssC_Abs
# Absolute value of the sum of dssC E-states.
# Usefulness: Measures total influence without regard to direction, thus making it consistent for regression models.
df['SdssC_Abs'] = df['SdssC'].abs()
end

Now, if there are columns that might not contribute well to the classification due to high sparsity or low variance, we can consider dropping these:

python
# Explanation why the column F01[N-N] is dropped
# This column has a very low mean and variance, leading to a lack of significant information gain for prediction.
df.drop(columns=['F01[N-N]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column B01[C-Br] is dropped
# The presence/absence of C-Br at topological distance 1 has a high skew with low mean, indicating low variation and predictive utility.
df.drop(columns=['B01[C-Br]'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column nCRX3 is dropped
# The number of CRX3 occurrences is extremely sparse and low in variance, contributing minorly to the discriminatory power.
df.drop(columns=['nCRX3'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column nArNO2 is dropped
# The number of aromatic nitro groups appears significantly sparse, offering limited predictive value across different instances.
df.drop(columns=['nArNO2'], inplace=True)
end

These transformations improve feature representation and could help enhance the predictive power of the model. The dropped columns were chosen based on low variance or high sparsity which generally indicates limited contribution to discriminating between the classes.

# nO_square
# Square of the number of oxygen atoms
# Usefulness: Oxygen is often a significant factor in biodegradation. By squaring the number of oxygen atoms, this feature emphasizes chemicals with a higher than average number of oxygens, which could be more prone to biodegradability.
df['nO_square'] = df['nO']2
end

python
# ratio_O2C_log
# Logarithm of the ratio of oxygen to carbon percentage
# Usefulness: The logarithm transformation can help in normalizing the distribution of the ratio and highlight smaller changes in numbers, which can be crucial for detecting subtle trends in biodegradability.
df['ratio_O2C_log'] = np.log(df['ratio_O2C'] + 1e-10)  # Adding a small value to avoid log(0)
end

python
# nCIR_plus_nCb_minus
# Sum of number of circuits and number of substituted benzene C(sp2)
# Usefulness: The combination of circuits and benzene substitutions gives insight into aromatic and complex structures which are notable for different biodegradation properties. More circuits and benzene rings typically suggest complexity and stability.
df['nCIR_plus_nCb_minus'] = df['nCIR'] + df['nCb-']
end

python
# carbon_oxygen_ratio
# Ratio of carbon to oxygen atoms
# Usefulness: Complementary to the oxygen-to-carbon ratio, understanding the inverse relationship will provide balance and catch patterns favoring carbon prevalence which might affect biodegradability.
df['carbon_oxygen_ratio'] = df['C%'] / (df['nO'] + 1e-10)  # Adding small value to avoid division by zero

end

python
# HyWi_B(m)_zscore
# Z-score of the Hyper-Wiener-like index from Burden matrix
# Usefulness: Standardizing this index helps to compare it across other features, giving it more meaning in a holistic assessment of molecular properties.
df['HyWi_B(m)_zscore'] = (df['HyWi_B(m)'] - df['HyWi_B(m)'].mean()) / df['HyWi_B(m)'].std()

python
# square_nO
# Features the contribution of molecular oxygen atoms in a squared scale, emphasizing molecules with more oxygen.
# Usefulness: Since oxygen is an indicator of biodegradability, squaring might highlight compounds with many oxygen atoms more significantly affecting their class label.

df['square_nO'] = df['nO']  2
end

python
# sqrt_C%
# Applies a square root transformation to the percentage of carbon atoms in a compound.
# Usefulness: Some machine learning models handle better with data that has undergone transformation to improve scaling or distribution, thereby potentially improving model predictions.

df['sqrt_C%'] = np.sqrt(df['C%'])
end

python
# ratio_O2H
# Ratio of the number of oxygen atoms to the number of donor atoms for H-bonds.
# Usefulness: This ratio can give insights into molecular structure related to hydrogen bonding, which can affect degradation.

df['ratio_O2H'] = df['nO'] / (df['nHDon'] + 1e-5)  # Added a small number to avoid division by zero

python
# abs_SdssC
# Absolute value of the Sum of dssC E-states.
# Usefulness: Emphasis on the magnitude of E-states regardless of direction (positive or negative), revealing the environment around carbon atoms that can influence biodegradability.

df['abs_SdssC'] = np.abs(df['SdssC'])

If we want to drop a feature that appears less useful or redundant, an explanation with the corresponding code is provided below:

python
# Explanation why the column F04[C-N] is dropped

# Biodegradability_index
# Calculate a biodegradability index based on distinct features that are biologically related such as number of oxygen atoms and the ratio_O2C.
# Usefulness: It potentially captures the combined effect of oxygen abundance and carbon structure percentage which are significant indicators of biodegradability according to the dataset description.
df['Biodegradability_index'] = df['nO'] + df['ratio_O2C'] * 10
