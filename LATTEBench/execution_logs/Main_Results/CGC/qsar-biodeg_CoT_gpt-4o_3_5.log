2025-12-29 16:07:04,245 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions, we can add several derived features from the existing numerical attributes using various transformations and interactions. This process is known as feature engineering. I'll provide some examples of useful features to add and columns we might consider dropping. 

python
# log_SpMax_L
# Logarithm of the Leading eigenvalue from Laplace matrix
# Usefulness: Stabilizes the variance and deals with potential skewness in the SpMax_L feature, given its positively skewed distribution.
df['log_SpMax_L'] = np.log(df['SpMax_L'] + 1)

# sqrt_J_Dz_e
# Square root of the Balaban-like index
# Usefulness: Acts to stabilize the variance and manage positive skewness in the J_Dz(e), improving model performance.
df['sqrt_J_Dz_e'] = np.sqrt(df['J_Dz(e)'])

# interact_nHM_SdO
# Interaction between Number of heavy atoms and Sum of dO E-states
# Usefulness: Captures potential nonlinear relationships between the complexity (heavy atoms) and E-states sum, relevant for biodegradability.
df['interact_nHM_SdO'] = df['nHM'] * df['SdO']

# ratio_C_percentage_F04_C_N
# Ratio of Percentage of C atoms to Frequency of C-N
# Usefulness: Evaluates balance between carbon presence and C-N relationships, possibly related to chemical structure leading to biodegradability.
df['ratio_C_percentage_F04_C_N'] = df['C%'] / (df['F04[C-N]'] + 1)

# exp_SM6_L
# Exponential transformation of Spectral moment of order 6
# Usefulness: Amplifies differences in this feature, highlighting extreme values, which can be beneficial if they correlate with class labels.
df['exp_SM6_L'] = np.exp(df['SM6_L'])

# abs_diff_Me_Mi
# Absolute difference between Mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity and Mean first ionization potential
# Usefulness: Captures the discrepancy in chemical properties affecting molecule activity and potentially biodegradability.
df['abs_diff_Me_Mi'] = abs(df['Me'] - df['Mi'])

# Usefulness of each synthesized feature is based on its ability to provide new insights or stabilize data distributions.


Next, considering dropping redundant or less informative columns:

python
# J_Dz(e) and SpMax_L provide similar structural information captured more effectively by transformed versions.
# Explanation why the column J_Dz(e) is dropped
df.drop(columns=['J_Dz(e)'], inplace=True)

# Given the computational complexity and diminished returns of ultra-high-frequency features.
# Explanation why the column F04[C-N] is dropped
df.drop(columns=['F04[C-N]'], inplace=True)

# Columns with heavily skewed distributions that may add noise.
# Explanation why the column nHM is dropped
df.drop(columns=['nHM'], inplace=True)


By focusing on transformations that stabilize variances, emphasize key interactions, and eliminate redundancy, these engineered features aim to improve the prediction accuracy for classifying chemical compounds into either 'ready biodegradable' or 'not ready biodegradable'.

2025-12-29 16:07:15,731 - INFO - LLM Output: To enhance the predictive power of the dataset, feature engineering can be employed based on the provided features and examples. Here are some potential new features and columns that can be helpful:

python
# Heavy Atom Ratio
df['Heavy_Atom_Ratio'] = df['nHM'] / (df['nHM'] + df['nCb-'] + df['nCp'] + df['nO'] + df['nN'] + df['nX'])
# Usefulness: This ratio is important for understanding the proportion of heavy atoms compared to other atoms which might influence biodegradability.

# Carbon to Oxygen Ratio
df['C_O_Ratio'] = df['C%'] / (df['nO'] + 1) # Adding 1 to avoid division by zero
# Usefulness: A higher carbon content with respect to oxygen might hint at less readiness for biodegradation as structures with more oxygen can be more reactive.

# N-O Bond Frequency Combined
df['NO_Bond_Freq'] = df['F01[N-N]'] + df['F02[C-N]'] + df['F03[C-N]'] + df['F04[C-N]']
# Usefulness: Aggregating nitrogen-oxygen related bonds at different topological distances to capture an overall influence.

# Electronegative Index
df['Electronegative_Index'] = df['Me'] * df['Mi']
# Usefulness: Combining electronegativity and ionization potential to form a holistic electronegative index which can influence chemical reactions relevant to biodegradability.

# Aromatic Content Indicator
df['Aromatic_Content'] = df['nArNO2'] + df['nCb-'] + df['nArCOOR']
# Usefulness: Counts various aromatic structures that might resist biodegradation due to stable aromatic rings.

# Periodic Element Presence
df['Halogen_Presence'] = (df['B03[C-Cl]'] > 0).astype(int) + (df['B01[C-Br]'] > 0).astype(int) + (df['B04[C-Br]'] > 0).astype(int) + (df['nX'] > 0).astype(int)
# Usefulness: Detects any halogen presence which can affect chemical stability and potential biodegradation pathways.

# Laplace vs Adjacency Connectivity Difference
df['Connectivity_Diff'] = df['SpMax_L'] - df['SpMax_A']
# Usefulness: Measures the difference between connectivity eigenvalues of Laplace and adjacency matrix, which can highlight structural disparity potentially linked to biodegradability.

# Molecular Circuit Indicator
df['Circuit_Presence'] = (df['nCIR'] > 0).astype(int)
# Usefulness: Binary indicator of presence of molecular circuits which, if present, may affect biodegradation due to cyclic stability.

end

These engineered features are designed to capture complex interactions and traits within molecules that may better predict biodegradability. Depending on the predictive model and further analysis, columns may be dropped if their statistical influence is minimal:

python
# Explanation why the column Psi_i_1d is dropped
df.drop(columns=['Psi_i_1d'], inplace=True)
# The Psi_i_1d (Intrinsic state pseudoconnectivity index - type 1d) feature shows minimal variation around zero and does not appear to offer significant information for biodegradability prediction.

# Explanation why the column nCRX3 is dropped
df.drop(columns=['nCRX3'], inplace=True)
# The nCRX3 column (Number of CRX3) provides very little variation in the dataset and rarely influences the readiness of biodegradability.

# Explanation why the column B04[C-Br] is dropped
df.drop(columns=['B04[C-Br]'], inplace=True)
# This feature, B04[C-Br] (Presence/absence of C - Br at topological distance 4), is binary and shows scant instances within the dataset, suggesting minimal impact on prediction tasks.

end

These drops and modifications are to streamline the dataset, focusing on features that hold statistical significance and potential chemical insight.

2025-12-29 16:07:36,063 - INFO - LLM Output: Certainly! Based on the dataset and attributes, here are some newly engineered features that might improve the predictions. These leverage mathematical transformations and insights into chemical properties that could help distinguish ready from not ready biodegradable chemicals.

python
# Feature name: Oxygen_Square_Ratio
# Feature description: Square of the ratio of the number of oxygen atoms to the mean number of oxygen atoms
# Usefulness: Since oxygen atoms are pivotal to molecular interactions and their number might influence biodegradability, this squared feature can highlight chemicals with a disproportionately high or low count relative to the norm.
df['Oxygen_Square_Ratio'] = np.square(df['nO'] / df['nO'].mean())
end

python
# Feature name: Log_C_O_Ratio
# Feature description: Log transformation of the Carbon to Oxygen Ratio
# Usefulness: Many chemical reactions are sensitive to the ratios of carbon and oxygen. A log transformation can stabilize the variance and help classifiers focus on relative differences.
df['Log_C_O_Ratio'] = np.log1p(df['C_O_Ratio'])
end

python
# Feature name: Electronegative_Squared
# Feature description: Square of the Electronegative Index
# Usefulness: The electronegative index can influence reactions rates and the readiness of compounds to degrade. Squaring this value might magnify the effect of electronegative disparities in the data.
df['Electronegative_Squared'] = np.square(df['Electronegative_Index'])
end

python
# Feature name: SdssC_Abs
# Feature description: Absolute value of Sum of dssC E-states
# Usefulness: E-states relate to potential energy surfaces of molecules. Absolute values might help enhance the significance of these electronic influences regardless of sign, given negative and positive dssC values.
df['SdssC_Abs'] = np.abs(df['SdssC'])
end

python
# Feature name: Polarizability_Reciprocal
# Feature description: Reciprocal of SpPosA_B(p)
# Usefulness: Normalized spectral positive sums are weighted by polarizability, influencing interactions. By taking the reciprocal, we focus on very low polarizability molecules which may have distinctive biodegradability profiles.
df['Polarizability_Reciprocal'] = 1 / (df['SpPosA_B(p)'] + 1e-6)  # Added small constant to avoid division by zero
end

Dropping columns that might be redundant or misleading for the given task:

python
# Explanation why the column Halogen_Presence is dropped
# The Halogen presence might not directly influence biodegradability in the context of these molecular descriptors and the given data doesn't show significant effects of halogens from the example set.
df.drop(columns=['Halogen_Presence'], inplace=True)
end

python
# Explanation why the column B01[C-Br] is dropped
# The presence of bromine atoms at certain distances might overly complicate the model without offering clear distinctions in biodegradability, especially with sparse occurrences in examples.
df.drop(columns=['B01[C-Br]'], inplace=True)
end

python
# Explanation why the column B03[C-Cl] is dropped
# Similar to bromine presence, chlorine presence at specific distances may not contribute significantly to distinguishing the two classes, based on initial analysis of example data.
df.drop(columns=['B03[C-Cl]'], inplace=True)
end

These engineered features provide additional insights into the chemical properties affecting biodegradability while the dropped columns remove potentially irrelevant attributes. Adjustments can be made based on more detailed exploratory data analysis or domain expertise.

2025-12-29 16:08:03,803 - INFO - LLM Output: To improve predictions in this dataset, we will perform feature engineering by creating new features that may be predictive for the classification task and can capture complex patterns. Let's implement these feature engineering steps:

python
# sqrt_C_O_Ratio
# Square root transformation of C_O_Ratio
# Usefulness: This feature is useful to compress the range of values and help in normalizing skewed data distributions with large values.
df['sqrt_C_O_Ratio'] = np.sqrt(df['C_O_Ratio'])

# log_SM6_L
# Log transformation of SM6_L
# Usefulness: Log transformation helps to manage skewed distribution and makes extreme values less influential in the prediction model.
df['log_SM6_L'] = np.log(df['SM6_L'] + 1)  # adding 1 to handle the case of log(0)

# bond_density
# Ratio of NO_Bond_Freq to nO
# Usefulness: Identifies the density of the NO bonds in relation to the number of oxygen atoms, potentially indicating molecule stability.
df['bond_density'] = df['NO_Bond_Freq'] / (df['nO'] + 1)  # adding 1 to prevent division by zero

# Diff_Connect_v_SpMax
# Difference between Connectivity_Diff and SpMax_L
# Usefulness: Highlights the variation between the structural connectivity and a spectral parameter that may signify molecular robustness.
df['Diff_Connect_v_SpMax'] = df['Connectivity_Diff'] - df['SpMax_L']

# halogen_and_aromatic_interaction
# Interaction term between Halogen Presence and Aromatic Content
# Usefulness: Explores the impact of aromatic compounds interacting with halogens, which affects molecular reactivity.
df['halogen_and_aromatic_interaction'] = df['Halogen_Presence'] * df['Aromatic_Content']

# nCIR_to_SpMax_A_ratio
# Ratio of number of circuits to SpMax_A
# Usefulness: Relates the circuit complexity to eigenvalue features, potentially indicating molecular complexity.
df['nCIR_to_SpMax_A_ratio'] = df['nCIR'] / df['SpMax_A']

# Normalized_SpPosA_B
# Feature normalization for SpPosA_B(p)
# Usefulness: Normalizing helps in speeding up the convergence of machine learning algorithms and compares relative strength.
df['Normalized_SpPosA_B'] = (df['SpPosA_B(p)'] - df['SpPosA_B(p)'].mean()) / df['SpPosA_B(p)'].std()

# sqrt_OxygenContent
# Square root transformation of nO
# Usefulness: Addresses potential non-linear relationships and manages variance when nO is large.
df['sqrt_OxygenContent'] = np.sqrt(df['nO'])

# Circuit_Presence_inverse
# Inversion of Circuit_Presence to capture absence explicitly
# Usefulness: Expresses the absence of circuit presence, potentially showing simpler structures.
df['Circuit_Presence_inverse'] = 1 - df['Circuit_Presence']
end

Additionally, let's drop columns that may not add significant value due to redundancy or significant correlation without additional insight:

python
# Explanation why the column NO_Bond_Freq is dropped
# The feature NO_Bond_Freq is dropped since its repeated calculation as Carbon to Oxygen Ratio in this context does not add significant unique information to the predictive model beyond the bond_density feature already constructed.
df.drop(columns=['NO_Bond_Freq'], inplace=True)

# Explanation why the column Halogen_Presence is dropped
# After constructing the interaction term (halogen_and_aromatic_interaction), Halogen_Presence is individually less meaningful in the presence of the interaction term that captures the complexity from multiple features.
df.drop(columns=['Halogen_Presence'], inplace=True)
end

These new features, when incorporated into a model, are designed to potentially enhance the prediction capability by capturing specific complex patterns within the chemical descriptor data.
