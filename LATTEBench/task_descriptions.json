    "poker-hand":"Each record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of 52. Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive attributes. Tatget describes the 'Poker Hand'. The order of cards is important, which is why there are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4 (one for each suit). Target = 0: Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand, 1: One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards, 2: Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards, 3: Three of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards, 4: Straight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps, 5: Flush; five cards with the same suit, 6: Full house; pair + different rank three of a kind, 7: Four of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards, 8: Straight flush; straight + flush, 9: Royal flush; {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten} + flush",
    "airlines":"Airlines Dataset Inspired in the regression dataset from Elena Ikonomovska. The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure.",

    "socmob": "The aim of this dataset is to study The Effects of Family Disruption on Social Mobility. Predict the counts for son's current occupation. We converts the numeric target feature to a two-class nominal target feature by computing the mean and classifying all instances with a lower target value as positive ('P') and all others as negative ('N').",
    "credit-approval":"Your task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card.",
    "Bioresponse":"Predict a biological response of molecules from their chemical properties. Each row in this data set represents a molecule. The target column contains experimental data describing an actual biological response; the molecule was seen to elicit this response (1), or not (0).",

    "cnae-9":"This is a data set containing 1080 documents of free text business descriptions of Brazilian companies categorized into a subset of 9 categories.",
    "speeddating":"This data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute 'first date' with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.",

    "balance-scale":"This data set was generated to model psychological experimental results. Each example is classified as having the balance scale tip to the right, tip to the left, or be balanced. The attributes are the left weight, the left distance, the right weight, and the right distance. The correct way to find the class is the greater of (left-distance * left-weight) and (right-distance * right-weight). If they are equal, it is balanced.",
    "vehicle":"The aim of this dataset is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle (OPEL, SAAB, BUS, VAN), using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.",
    "nomao":"Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots. Labels are 1 if the concerned spots must be merged, 2 if they do not refer to the same entity.",
    "electricity":"The label identifies the change of the price (UP or DOWN) in New South Wales relative to a moving average of the last 24 hours (and removes the impact of longer term price trends).",
